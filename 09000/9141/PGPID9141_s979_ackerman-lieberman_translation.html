                        <ol><li>The established (relationship) between me and between the Elder Sibā‘ in that which he gave me in terms of specie, which was</li><li>two hundred din(ars) by way of a joint enterprise (mu‘āmala) with the following stipulations, being that </li><li>the Elder Sibā‘ would have from the total which exalted God facilitates in terms of</li><li>profit, the wheat and wine which he needed each year.</li><li>However, he specified that this excepted (the cost of) his dwelling in his residence, and the education</li><li>of his son. I approve of this along with my right of disposal of this aforementioned sum, (the right to)</li><li>transact with it, buying and selling commodities, and traveling to Alexandria</li><li>and transporting it to that location as well. I agree that whenever</li><li>something is lost or m[y] work is stopped, or </li><li>merchandise is broken, that he is obligated therein for that which he specified out of every</li><li>hundred din[ars] allocated to him, half. </li><li>If exalted God facilitates the journey to Alexandria or the dispatch</li><li>thereto with someone other than me, or a shipment or a share in (some sort of) profit(-making venture), </li><li>each person will take upon himself (responsibility for its) arrival and risk of each dirham; that which was specified for me</li><li>will be specified for me, and that which was specified for him will be specified for him, inasmuch as I will inform him that </li><li>such-and-such has departed on a journey. Likewise also</li><li>the Elder Sibā‘ has agreed that the rest of that which exalted God facilitates</li><li>and whatver profit [He] grants in this aforementioned coin (that is, in the investment)—</li><li>he agreed in free will without any duress whatsoever—he gave it to me</li><li>as an absolute gift, effective immediately, completely re/lin/quishing (his rights thereto)</li><li>both orally and in his heart, both in this world and in the next. This is</li><li>irrevocable  &lt;Upside Down, Arabic Script&gt; …… &lt;Right Side Up, Hebrew Script&gt; and (without) reversal</li><li>in claiming that, nor obstinancy therein, nor troubling him</li><li> &lt;Arabic script&gt; …….. and he came specifically for this</li><li>&lt;Hebrew script&gt; in any way. Likewise, he has already declared me to be, in all that which I had the right of free disposal (in the past) </li><li>and in that which I (now) have the right of free disposal, as well as in all other </li></ol>
