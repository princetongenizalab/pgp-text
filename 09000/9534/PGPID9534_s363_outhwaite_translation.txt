To the honourable, great, holy, glorious crown and diadem
to all of the holy community, who are pious, righteous, wise
and have understanding from Heaven – our God preserve them eternally.
Amen. Your maidservant ‘Azuza the old, weak westerner
requests from the Lord and from you to show me God’s kindness
because I am [naked] and the [heat] consumes me by [day] and the cold  
by night and [my sleep flees. And] I have no covering […]
Death [… and I request] from [Heaven that you show]  
me kindness and that you open your hands to me [that] I might not come back  
from you empty-handed, for on the [Lord] have I cast my burden
and on you. Do not hide your eyes from me.  
May the God of Israel save you from all trouble, and may He answer  you  
in a day of trouble. And may he send a blessing through
the deeds of your hands. May your wellbeing increase forever. Amen.
