<li>To the honourable, great, holy, glorious crown and diadem</li>
<li>to all of the holy community, who are pious, righteous, wise</li>
<li>and have understanding from Heaven – our God preserve them eternally.</li>
<li>Amen. Your maidservant ‘Azuza the old, weak westerner</li>
<li>requests from the Lord and from you to show me God’s kindness</li>
<li>because I am [naked] and the [heat] consumes me by [day] and the cold  </li>
<li>by night and [my sleep flees. And] I have no covering […]</li>
<li>Death [… and I request] from [Heaven that you show]  </li>
<li>me kindness and that you open your hands to me [that] I might not come back  </li>
<li>from you empty-handed, for on the [Lord] have I cast my burden</li>
<li>and on you. Do not hide your eyes from me.  </li>
<li>May the God of Israel save you from all trouble, and may He answer  you  </li>
<li>in a day of trouble. And may he send a blessing through</li>
<li>the deeds of your hands. May your wellbeing increase forever. Amen.  </li>
