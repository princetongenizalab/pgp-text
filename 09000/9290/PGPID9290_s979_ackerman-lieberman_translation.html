                        <ol><li>Suleyman b. Ḥasson and his son Isḥaq came to court, and</li><li>Dāwūd b. Ḥasan, nicknamed Abū Ja‘d, came, in the synagogue of the Shāmiyin,</li><li>and (they) testified concerning themselves that they established their service in</li><li>washing their corpses for all that  the community wished—day or night,</li><li>they would not delay therein. They would not place conditions on the families of the deceased,</li><li>nor would they refuse them. A complete qinyan was performed with them concerning this,</li><li>with an item suitable for doing so. Then, Suleyman b. Ḥassūn and</li><li>his son Isḥaq partnered with this Dāwūd, such that during</li><li>the shift of one of them, all of them will serve therein until</li><li>they finish the work, each of them on behalf of the other, with a full heart and clear intention. </li><li>Of whatever God provides, small or large, Dāwūd will have a quarter,</li><li>and the remainder will be for Suleyman and his son. [And] when one (of them) collects on a request (for services rendered), he will bring it</li><li>to Suleyman; a quarter of it will be for this Dāwūd. None of them may violate (this agreement,) </li><li>A complete qinyan was performed with them concerning this,</li><li>with an item suitable for doing so. This was written on Thursday in the month of Shevaṭ,</li><li>the twenty-fifth (of the month), of the year 1372 (of the Era) of Documents,</li><li>in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. ‘Alī ha-Levi b. S</li><li>Samuel b. Abraham …  [A]bū  Ḥasan Surūr b. Ḥayyim Ibn Sabra (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li></ol>
