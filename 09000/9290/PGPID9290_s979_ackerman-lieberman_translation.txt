Suleyman b. Ḥasson and his son Isḥaq came to court, andDāwūd b. Ḥasan, nicknamed Abū Ja‘d, came, in the synagogue of the Shāmiyin,and (they) testified concerning themselves that they established their service inwashing their corpses for all that  the community wished—day or night,they would not delay therein. They would not place conditions on the families of the deceased,nor would they refuse them. A complete qinyan was performed with them concerning this,with an item suitable for doing so. Then, Suleyman b. Ḥassūn andhis son Isḥaq partnered with this Dāwūd, such that duringthe shift of one of them, all of them will serve therein untilthey finish the work, each of them on behalf of the other, with a full heart and clear intention. Of whatever God provides, small or large, Dāwūd will have a quarter,and the remainder will be for Suleyman and his son. [And] when one (of them) collects on a request (for services rendered), he will bring itto Suleyman; a quarter of it will be for this Dāwūd. None of them may violate (this agreement,) A complete qinyan was performed with them concerning this,with an item suitable for doing so. This was written on Thursday in the month of Shevaṭ,the twenty-fifth (of the month), of the year 1372 (of the Era) of Documents,in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. ‘Alī ha-Levi b. SSamuel b.
