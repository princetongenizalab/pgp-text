                        <p>My lord and master, may God make your honored position permanent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I received this letter from our master and teacher Judah b. Ghiyāṭ. lord of mine and admirer of yours, may God elevate you both, and decided to rush it to you so that you may enjoy it &mdash;&nbsp; may God let me enjoy your company.</p>
<p>In my previous letter I thanked you for your efforts in the matter of the captive woman. Kindly alert her father to come to us, for her affair is nearing a satisfactory solution: We here in the town pay 10 mithqāls; the Turks, the Ghuzz have sent 4 or so; and then the mithqāl donated by you. From Malaga we expect 6, and when he (her father) will bring 10 from Lucena, the matter will be settled and we may get his daughter out before the holidays. For that wicked woman has changed her mind and does not permit us any longer to take the girl out of the prison on Sabbaths and holidays. If he (her father) prefers to send us what has been collected thus far and to go to Granada in order to secure what might still be missing from the 32 let him do so. But I believe the best thing is to obtain her release as quickly as possible. God may guide us to whatever may be the best. The final term agreed with the wicked woman is the end of Tishri and she does not grant us even one hour more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly let me know how you are in body and soul may God shelter them in his grace. And Peace!&nbsp;</p>
