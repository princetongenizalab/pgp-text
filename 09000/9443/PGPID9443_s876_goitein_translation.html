<li>
<p>[Your servant took notice of... and your yearning] for him, a feeling shared by me. [May God ordain that] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>prosperity and health prevail in your court and grant in his grace that I be united with you. As to what you have m[entioned] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in your kind letter about your longing to meet me, I have an even larger part and a greater&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share of this. In God all matters are united. The reason for writing this letter is to tell your excellency what </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>happened to me on this voyage. In my p[revious] letters to your excellency I informed you </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about my travel to Sindabur. God granted me safety, I finally arrived in al-M[alībā?]r and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bought what God, the exalted, made available, to the extent reported in my previous letters. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We intended, on our way home, to travel to Aden, but riots and bloodshed occurred, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and [who]ever was in the town fled. The [shipmas]ter, namely, 'All Nawak, wan[ted] also to flee, but I discovered this&nbsp;</p>

<li>[and informed X. about it], but he did not believe me. We loaded the </li>
<li>textiles and the iron during the night, for he (Nawak) had the power to keep us back [by refusing to sail]. Finally, we all fled to Faknur. I had left </li>
<li>some of the pepper and many of the smaller items with Jacob Ibn Thābit. We arrived </li>
<li>in Faknur, where ʿAlī Nawak disembarked and remained, while we went on in the same ship to Kulam and stayed there for some time.</li>
<li>When the night of ... arrived, we loaded and set sail, 35 days before New Year.</li>
<li>The captain had been ill while still in town, but we sailed for ten days. </li>
<li>When we encountered a large pusht (a reef, or another underwater obstacle), water being five fathoms high, and did not know whether this was the Fal (the northern end of the Laccadive Islands) or not,</li>
<li>God granted us safety, but the captain had a stroke and died. We threw his body overboard into the sea. So the boat remained </li>
<li>without a commander and a . . ., and we had no charts. A crowd </li>
<li>in the ship was afraid the ship would be lost, if it landed in an Arab country. However, if we returned to </li>
<li>India, there too the same might happen. They got the upper hand and returned us to Kulam. We gave up hope of saving our goods. </li>
<li>After twenty days we arrived in Kulam, the place we feared. But God granted us </li>
<li>delivery immediately.&nbsp;The .. ., the .. ., and the manager came on board and took</li>
<li>the ship from&nbsp;us, confirming its rights to its proprietor, being afraid of ʿAlī Nawak. </li>
<li>They provided us with water and wood. Two captains travelled with us, after they had signed documents (confirming their obligations) towards us, </li>
