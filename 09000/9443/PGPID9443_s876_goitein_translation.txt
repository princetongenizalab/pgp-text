The captain had been ill while still in town, but we sailed for ten days. 
When we encountered a large pusht (a reef, or another underwater obstacle), water being five fathoms high, and did not know whether this was the Fal (the northern end of the Laccadive Islands) or not,
God granted us safety, but the captain had a stroke and died. We threw his body overboard into the sea. So the boat remained 
without a commander and a . . ., and we had no charts. A crowd 
in the ship was afraid the ship would be lost, if it landed in an Arab country. However, if we returned to 
India, there too the same might happen. They got the upper hand and returned us to Kulam. We gave up hope of saving our goods. 
After twenty days we arrived in Kulam, the place we feared. But God granted us 
delivery immediately. The .. ., the .. ., and the manager came on board and took
the ship from us, confirming its rights to its proprietor, being afraid of ʿAlī Nawak. 
They provided us with water and wood. Two captains travelled with us, after they had signed documents (confirming their obligations) towards us,
