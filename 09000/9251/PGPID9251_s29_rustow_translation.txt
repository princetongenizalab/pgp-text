God is sufficient for me.
What his servant has sent to my master and lord Mufaḍḍal b. Abū Saʿd,
may God perpetuate his glory:
In care of the elder Yaḥyā b. Abī l-Qāsim
al-Sakhāwī, on the riding animal of Ibn al-Naffākh:
three bales of lac, the weight of each one
bale being 400 pounds;
two mixed bales, the weight of each bale
being a bahār, half of it pepper, half of it ginger;
one bale of cleaned cloves weighing
40 gross mann;
one bale of clove stalks weighing 50 mann.
Everything bears the ʿalāma Mufaḍḍal b.
Abī Saʿd.
For the elder Abū Naṣr, twin brother of my lord,
in exchange for what he had in care of Futūḥ:
a bale of pepper weighing 140 pounds,
bearing its ʿalāma.
With the aforementioned also a bale
containing three bags of cleaned clove
bearing the ʿalāma Mufaḍḍal
b. Abī Saʿd.
