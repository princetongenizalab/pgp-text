                        <ol>
<li>
<p>I informed my lord what Ibn Sutayt and Ibn al-Shimūs Shimūs did to me,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and that is that I had the corals for the elder Abū Zikrī. I agreed to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>smuggle it out of customs in ʿAdhāb. The aforementioned proceeded, may they be remembered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in banishment, and reported on me. They lost me 7.5 dīnārs. By my trust&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Heaven, what happened with me is that I only ever dealt with them charitably, and they dealt with me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with purulence. Evil will never leave the houses of those who repay goodness with wickedness (Proverbs 17:13).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not telling you this, but rather you yourself know the (rank of) the Jews,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by God. (This letter) is written (to you, may God) protect you, from the harbor, as I am boarding the ship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the 25th day of Iyyār. Please forgive me for any mistakes. Great wellbeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I send my lord and master my best, most abundant,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>greatest and complete regards. Likewise to my lord the most exalted elder, (our) te(acher) and ma(ster) Yeḥezkel,</p>
</li>

<li>your brother, may God prolong his life, and the best wellbeing for </li>
<li>
<p>his sons. To the elder Abū Naṣir and the elder Abu ʾl Faraj,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the best wellbeing, and great peace.</p>
