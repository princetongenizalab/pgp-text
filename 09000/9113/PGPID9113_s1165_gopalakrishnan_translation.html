                        <ol>
<li>
<p>The letter of my master and lord, the sage and [... (our) te(acher) and ma(ster) Ḥalfon]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ha-Levi b. (our) te(acher) and ma(ster) Netanʾel ha-Le[vi, the sage and scholar,]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>m(ay) (his) s(oul be) b(undled) in the (bundle of life), arrived — the most exalted and highest of letters — may God make his glory </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and wellbeing eternal, and, in His benefaction, prolong his life and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>realise his goals to the ut[most] of his hopes and the greatest extents of his happiness,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and may He crush with disdainful humiliation those envious of him and his enemies!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I previously sent a letter to his excellency, my master, before </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his esteemed letter reached me. When the letter reached me from his excellency,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord and master, my longing for his excellency doubled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from what I felt before. May God the exalted unite (me)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with him in His kindness after the fulfillment of our needs. What I mentioned to him </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the matter of the fine linen fabric, and the blocks of cheese,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have done, may God guard you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lord need not inform me again of his commands, for he </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knows that his matters are not forgotten by me. I am </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attending to them more than (I attend to) my own matters. The details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of what I owe you, God willing, will reach him in a letter </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from Aden. His servant has mentioned to him in the </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>previous letter (sent?) with the elder Makārim a [matter]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the Sijilmāsī man with whom [my] lett[er] arrived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I request from you that you deal </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with him as you are accustomed.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The elder Abū Zikrī delivered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his goods to him. You have heard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some of what he suffered&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at the hands of our colleagues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I request from my lord&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you protect him with your solicitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps he will return</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to this land&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so that God may give him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>success. I cannot &mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God protect you &mdash;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write to you, by God,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about the man and his piety (?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because he is my relative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But you can ask the people&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who traveled with him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about him, and they will inform you&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about him.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>[...] I am short on words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[The] kindness [you will show] him is part of the kindness you will show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[me.] You [are not] the one who needs to speak about acting kindly (?)</p>

<li>
<p>I informed my lord what Ibn Sutayt and Ibn al-Shimūs Shimūs did to me,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and that is that I had the corals for the elder Abū Zikrī. I agreed to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>smuggle it out of customs in ʿAdhāb. The aforementioned proceeded, may they be remembered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in banishment, and reported on me. They lost me 7.5 dīnārs. By my trust&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Heaven, what happened with me is that I only ever dealt with them charitably, and they dealt with me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with purulence. Evil will never leave the houses of those who repay goodness with wickedness (Proverbs 17:13).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not telling you this, but rather you yourself know the (rank of) the Jews,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by God. (This letter) is written (to you, may God) protect you, from the harbor, as I am boarding the ship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the 25th day of Iyyār. Please forgive me for any mistakes. Great wellbeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I send my lord and master my best, most abundant,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>greatest and complete regards. Likewise to my lord the most exalted elder, (our) te(acher) and ma(ster) Yeḥezkel,</p>

<li>
<p>his sons. To the elder Abū Naṣir and the elder Abu ʾl Faraj,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the best wellbeing, and great peace.</p>
