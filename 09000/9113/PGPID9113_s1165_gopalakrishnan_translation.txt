[...] I am short on words.


[The] kindness [you will show] him is part of the kindness you will show


[me.] You [are not] the one who needs to speak about acting kindly (?)


Verso, main text


I informed my lord what Ibn Sutayt and Ibn al-Shimūs Shimūs did to me,


and that is that I had the corals for the elder Abū Zikrī. I agreed to


smuggle it out of customs in ʿAdhāb. The aforementioned proceeded, may they be remembered


in banishment, and reported on me. They lost me 7.5 dīnārs. By my trust 


in Heaven, what happened with me is that I only ever dealt with them charitably, and they dealt with me


with purulence. Evil will never leave the houses of those who repay goodness with wickedness (Proverbs 17:13). 


I am not telling you this, but rather you yourself know the (rank of) the Jews,


by God. (This letter) is written (to you, may God) protect you, from the harbor, as I am boarding the ship


on the 25th day of Iyyār. Please forgive me for any mistakes. Great wellbeing.


I send my lord and master my best, most abundant,


greatest and complete regards. Likewise to my lord the most exalted elder, (our) te(acher) and ma(ster) Yeḥezkel,


Verso, right margin

your brother, may God prolong his life, and the best wellbeing for 

his sons. To the elder Abū Naṣir and the elder Abu ʾl Faraj,


the best wellbeing, and great peace.

[ha-Levi, m(ay)] (his) s(oul be) b(undled) in the (bundle of life).
