                        <p>I am writing to you, my esteemed elder, master, and chief, may God prolong your life and make lasting [your honored position], well-being, and security, on Elul 23. I am safe and in good health, many [thanks be to God]. [I am yearning for] the sight of your blessed countenance; may God unite us in the best of circumstances and in perfect happiness.</p>
<p>Your enjoyable letters have arrived and I have gathered from them that you are fine; may God ordain that it should always be so; may he ever increase his boons to you and shower upon you his favors.</p>
<p>My elder and master, you say that I too\ the brazilwood and sent it to Spain. I did not take it for myself, nor have I made any profit from it. Rather, it caused me losses. I acted thus because I rely upon you and because you are helpful to me with your high rank in matters of the goods sent by me to you on my account. I was sure that you would write me exactly the opposite of what you have written, which offended me so much and for which I do not know any reason. Your shipment was sent in Iyyar (April/May) and mine was sent to you in Av (July/August); could your consignment possibly have come from Spain and made all this in two months? And even if this was possible, would you not have acted similarly </p>
<p>You w[rite in your letters that] I should send you the 420 pounds of silk. But one-third of this is my brother's investment, besides which he is entitled to a third of the profit along with you. Moreover, the merchants are unanimously of the opinion that silk sells in Qayrawan better than in Fustat. Here (a pound) sells for 1½ dinars of Qayrawan standard weight. I wished I had immediately forwarded to you your share, as you instructed me, for most of the proceeds are still outstanding and I have debited myself with all that is due my brother and due you. I have received payment for 100 pounds from Salama of al-Mahdiyya only eight days before the writing of this letter. With Ibn al-Ṣabbagh ("Mr. Dyer") there is also a debt outstanding, for I sold to him on credit. I also lost much money which was due us from the colorists, but did not charge anything to the two of you, for my brother settled his accounts with me before his departure and took what was due him. And this is my reward from you after all this.</p>
<p>I sent you 100 less one-quarter 'Azīzī dinars in the caravan of the Sijilmasis with Abu Ί-Surur b. Barhun.This was taken from my own money, for at that time I had not received a penny from the price of the silk. I acted thus because of my esteem for  you and because of your illustrious position, your noble character, and piety. All I ask from you is that you act with respect to my goods sent to you in the same manner as I acted with your goods sent to me.</p>
<p>Then you sent those pearls and I worked hard collecting their price. For how long shall this go on?! Should I not have taken one quarter of the profit? Through me you have made a profit of close to ι dinar per dinar, and all this was of no advantage to me. I expected only that you would exert yourself for me, at least that you would send me what you owe me. Had I owed you 2,000 dinars, would I withhold them from you? Would they not reach you (even) by sea to your satisfaction? If you had sent my money, I would have made good use of it—as you have made of yours. And what had happened if, God forbid, your goods had traveled a second time and entered my account? How would I then stand before you? But God, may he be praised and exalted, knows my good intentions, and he rewards every man according to his intention.</p>
<p>What disturbed me most was your failure to pay to Ibn Yazdad and Salama, the son-in-law of Furayj, the sum that I asked you to pay them or to give them the equivalent in goods, although I had advised you expressly to do so. You have withheld payment from them, while this is a debt upon me. And this, at a time when your merchandise was in SpainI Their letters vituperating me have now come here to everyone and my honor has been disgraced. Had you only made promises to them and said: "He has given instructions for you," they would have been patient and I would have been spared those vituperations.</p>
<p>Our Maghrebi friends told me what they had heard in your name from Abu Ί-Khayr b. Barhun, that I had written to you asking you to replace Ibn MajjanI by myself. I have not wanted this. I am not prepared to undertake it, nor have I any need for this. What I do need is to benefit from your high position and that you exert yourself for my goods as I do for yours. What I did say is that you should entrust me with your affairs just as I entrust you with mine. But after having taken care of someone else's affairs or having formed a partnership with him, God forbid that I and my honor should then be treated in this improper way. I never withhold a penny from anyone else, nor is any claim made against me at any time.</p>
<p>I had made an agreement with Farah ("Joy") of Fez with regard to the remainder of the brazilwood, to the effect that I take it and send it to Spain [at a c]ommission, but on the condition that I will bear responsibility (for its loss). Each qintar (100 pounds) was appraised at 12 dinars in the presence of a number of our friends. </p>
<p>You, not I, had to have the choice since all this was to be on your behalf. Finally, Faraḥ did not do it. Thank God that this did not materialize, for you would have treated me in this matter as you have done before. But, by God, my master, the profit with this would have been even greater than with the first shipment. For this year brazilwood which I had bought in Qayrawan for 265 dirhems was sold on my behalf for 125 dinars. God knew my good intentions and spared me many troubles in a matter from which I would not have had any advantages.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I do not dare to say to you: "Send me your things and I shall handle them," fearing that you may tell stories about me that I have asked you to put me in Ibn al-Majjani's place.I do not need this. The little we have here in the Maghreb is worth the abundance you have over there. But after all, I am your servant and prepared to deal, for your profit and without advantage for me, with anything you might send me. By God, my lord, this will give me only pleasure. God knows.</p>
<p>Kindest personal regards to my master, the elder, and to his two sons Hillel and Benjamin, may God protect and keep them.</p>
<p>Margin: I copied for you from my account book the account for the sale of the silk, and the expenses involved from beginning to end, including a description of each item and showing how it was sold without any loss for you. May God replace that which has gone ... for what has remained with the "colorists" can never be recovered. Please examine the account and take notice of all its details. If you have any doubts, let me know and I shall give you the necessary explanations, if God wills.</p>

<p>To my master and chief, the [illustrious] elder, Abu 'I-Faraj, may God prolong his life and make permanent his honored position and prosperity, Yusuf (Joseph) b. Ya'qub (Jacob) Ibn 'Awkal—(may his) s(oul) r(est in peace). May God be his friend, protector, helper, and shepherd.</p>
