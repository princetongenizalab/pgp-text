Recto

I am writing this lines to my lord and brother and the one for whom
I would sacrifice myself in haste because of the messenger,
in response to his kind letter, which arrived in the hands of
Abū Saʿd, son of the elder Abū ʿAlī b. al-Kirnīb.
God knows my happiness at his health and wellbeing.
But these things that have been set in motion against him
and me, and my break — there is nothing to be done. "This, too, is for the best" (b.Taʿanit 21a and parallels).
God knows that I myself am in hell because of all 
these issues. But I won't tell you and worry you.
I'm being oppressed, but (I am also) in the form of an oppressor (i.e., I'm contributing to my own problems), because
of this cheese — nothing has arrived from him. I've
already dragged people through legal proceedings because of it. A decision
hasn't been reached about it. The person I was negotiating with
over it without involving witnesses has refused me and sworn (Goitein: falsely), and all manner of 
sinister things. The judges aren't deciding the matter,
the rayyis isn't free to sit in session, and if the judges sit
on their own, (the decision) they (make) won't be accepted. As for what's in the dār
al-wakīl, God knows that since I left the port,
 I haven't paid a single dirham of what I owe on it.
The judges haven't come to a decision and they haven't set out 
a settlement. I'm being cut off from every place. I repaid 
Ibn al-Amshāṭī the seventeen dīnārs
and took his signature (on a quittance) and had the Nezer witness it,
and Faḍl b. Binyām and his brother in Alexandria
signed their attestations on his signature. I sent everything with
the elder Abū l-Makārim b. Qassāsa.
Let me know, my lord, whether the elder Abū l-Ḥasan b.

{Ibn} Khulayf
said that he's collected
only eight dīnārs.
God forbid this is the case, 
since the man had already collected from me
a dinar's worth of dirhams earlier,
whereas the eight happened recently,
five in dirhams and three
in gold coins. As for the news about the donkey,
the right thing to do would have been
for it to be sold for two dīnārs
bare, with no tack, since
the tack would have cost twenty
dirhams and I would only have bought it
from them for three
and two qīrāṭs. I already sent 
three dīnārs in
change and the difference due to the lost donkey.
As for ʿImrān,
he told me, "We won't cause you any losses,
since you're already doing
a favor for us. But as to
what my lord reported about
what my lord the elder
Abū Saʿīd Makhlūf 
al-Yatīm said: the Creator knows
that my intention was only
to meet his need. Because

up until this moment,
I haven't done business with him,
because I
traveled to

at the beginning of
Iyyar, and
Abū Saʿd

with me.

God knows that the aforementioned Abū Saʿd isn't able
— even though he's a tax-farmer — {able} to bring back the silk
of Abū Zikrī al-Kohen (to Fustat). This
silk(er?) — since he has a partner in the obligation,
the tax-farmer of Cairo — and he can't come to
me any time to take silk unless
