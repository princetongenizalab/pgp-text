Recto

I am writing this lines to my lord and brother and the one for whom
I would sacrifice myself in haste because of the messenger,
in response to his kind letter, which arrived in the hands of
Abū Saʿd, son of the elder Abū ʿAlī b. al-Kirnīb.
God knows my happiness at his health and wellbeing.
But these things that have been set in motion against him
and me, and my break — there is nothing to be done. "This, too, is for the best" (b.Taʿanit 21a and parallels).

a settlement. I'm being cut off from every place. I repaid 
Ibn al-Amshāṭī the seventeen dīnārs
and took his signature (on a quittance) and had the Nezer witness it,
and Faḍl b. Binyām and his brother in Alexandria
signed their attestations on his signature. I sent everything with
the elder Abū l-Makārim b. Qassāsa.
Let me know, my lord, whether the elder Abū l-Ḥasan b.
