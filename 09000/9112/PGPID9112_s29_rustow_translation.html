                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I am writing this lines to my lord and brother and the one for whom</li>
<li>I would sacrifice myself in haste because of the messenger,</li>
<li>in response to his kind letter, which arrived in the hands of</li>
<li>Abū Saʿd, son of the elder Abū ʿAlī b. al-Kirnīb.</li>
<li>God knows my happiness at his health and wellbeing.</li>
<li>But these things that have been set in motion against him</li>
<li>and me, and my break &mdash; there is nothing to be done. "This, too, is for the best" (b.Taʿanit 21a and parallels).</li>
<li>God knows that I myself am in hell because of all&nbsp;</li>
<li>these issues. But I won't tell you and worry you.</li>
<li>I'm being oppressed, but (I am also) in the form of an oppressor (i.e., I'm contributing to my own problems), because</li>
<li>of this cheese &mdash; nothing has arrived from him.&nbsp;I've</li>
<li>already dragged people through legal proceedings because of it. A decision</li>
<li>hasn't been reached about it. The person I was negotiating with</li>
<li>over it without involving witnesses has refused me and sworn (Goitein: falsely), and all manner of&nbsp;</li>
<li>sinister things. The judges aren't deciding the matter,</li>
<li>the rayyis isn't free to sit in session, and if the judges sit</li>
<li>on their own, (the decision) they (make) won't be accepted. As for what's in the dār</li>
<li>al-wakīl, God knows that&nbsp;since&nbsp;I left the port,</li>
<li>&nbsp;I haven't paid a single dirham of what I owe on it.</li>
<li>The judges haven't come to a decision and they haven't set out&nbsp;</li>
<li>a settlement. I'm being cut off from every place. I repaid&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ibn al-Amshāṭī the seventeen dīnārs</li>
<li>and took his signature (on a quittance) and had the Nezer witness it,</li>
<li>and Faḍl b. Binyām and his brother in Alexandria</li>
<li>signed their attestations on his signature. I sent everything with</li>
<li>the elder Abū l-Makārim b. Qassāsa.</li>
<li>Let me know, my lord, whether the elder Abū l-Ḥasan b.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>{Ibn} Khulayf</li>
<li>said that he's collected</li>
<li>only eight dīnārs.</li>
<li>God forbid this is the case,&nbsp;</li>
<li>since the man had already collected from me</li>
<li>a dinar's worth of dirhams earlier,</li>
<li>whereas the eight happened recently,</li>
<li>five in dirhams and three</li>
<li>in gold coins. As for the news about the donkey,</li>
<li>the right thing to do would have been</li>
<li>for it to be sold for two dīnārs</li>
<li>bare, with no tack, since</li>
<li>the tack would have cost twenty</li>
<li>dirhams and I would only have bought it</li>
<li>from them for three</li>
<li>and two qīrāṭs. I already sent&nbsp;</li>
<li>three dīnārs in</li>
<li>change and the difference due to the lost donkey.</li>
<li>As for ʿImrān,</li>
<li>he told me, "We won't cause you any losses,</li>
<li>since you're already doing</li>
<li>a favor for us. But as to</li>
<li>what my lord reported&nbsp;about</li>
<li>what my lord the elder</li>
<li>Abū Saʿīd Makhlūf&nbsp;</li>
<li>al-Yatīm said: the Creator knows</li>
<li>that my intention was only</li>
<li>to meet his need. Because</li>

                        <h3>Recto, top margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>up until this moment,</li>
<li>I haven't done business with him,</li>
<li>because I</li>
<li>traveled to</li>
<li>Banhā only&nbsp;</li>
<li>at the beginning&nbsp;of</li>
<li>Iyyar, and</li>
<li>Abū Saʿd</li>
<li>the silker was</li>
<li>with me.</li>
</ol>
                    
                </div>
            
                <div data-canvas="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/iiif/MS-TS-NS-J-00007/canvas/2">
                    
                    
                    
                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>God knows that the aforementioned Abū Saʿd isn't able</li>
<li>&mdash; even though he's a tax-farmer &mdash; {able} to bring</li>
<li>Abū Zikrī al-Kohen's silk back (to Fustat). This</li>
<li>silk(er?) &mdash; since he has a partner in the obligation,</li>
<li>the tax-farmer of Cairo, he can't come to</li>
<li>me any time to take silk unless&nbsp;</li>
<li>he's stealing it. If it weren't for me, he couldn't have done it.</li>
<li>Also, the tax-farm of the (dār) al-ṣināʿa and the tax-collector (mushidd)</li>
<li>don't let him take one raṭl as</li>
<li>a fee, or it's said to him, That's not yours! The injustice</li>
<li>{the injustice} is rampant. So from the moment I</li>
<li>arrived in Qalyūb, I've been by myself, and Abū Saʿd has caught up with me</li>
<li>accompanied by Abū l-Ḥasan al-Asmar ("the swarthy"), known&nbsp;</li>
<li>as Ibn Buthayna. I brought the silk down when they were with me,</li>
<li>and I brought the scales and they weighed it, minus</li>
<li>a quantity of two raṭls, and added up the total,</li>
<li>which came to 15&frac12; (dīnārs) per 10 (raṭls).</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>So Abū Saʿd said:</li>
<li>"To me this is only worth</li>
<li>14 (dīnārs) per 10 (raṭls),</li>
<li>and there is something in it (that makes it) worth</li>
<li>13 (dīnārs) per 10 (raṭls), because I&nbsp;</li>
<li>want to raise (the price) by</li>
<li>a dīnār and subtract the commission (?)</li>
<li>and the tax obligation." I came back,</li>
<li>God knows, to this speech</li>
<li>from a number of angles, but he</li>
<li>didn't deviate from his words.</li>
<li>He said: I don't</li>
<li>want it.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso, bottom</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>So then I took it myself out of shame.</li>
<li>Then it turned out, if had he taken it, it would have been detained</li>
<li>witih him (coming back to Fustat), since he's lost his tax-farm&nbsp;</li>
<li>and all their silk has been detained. He and his brother</li>
<li>are in a bad situation, and I, if God wills,&nbsp;</li>
<li>will pay them in Sivan and bring him (you)&nbsp;</li>
<li>the entirety of it, and it will be over. I paid&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
