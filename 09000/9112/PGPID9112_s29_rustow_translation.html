                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I am writing this lines to my lord and brother and the one for whom</li>
<li>I would sacrifice myself in haste because of the messenger,</li>
<li>in response to his kind letter, which arrived in the hands of</li>
<li>Abū Saʿd, son of the elder Abū ʿAlī b. al-Kirnīb.</li>
<li>God knows my happiness at his health and wellbeing.</li>
<li>But these things that have been set in motion against him</li>
<li>and me, and my break &mdash; there is nothing to be done. "This, too, is for the best" (b.Taʿanit 21a and parallels).</li>
<li>God knows that I myself am in hell because of all&nbsp;</li>
<li>these issues. But I won't tell you and worry you.</li>
<li>I'm being oppressed, but (I am also) in the form of an oppressor (i.e., I'm contributing to my own problems), because</li>
<li>of this cheese &mdash; nothing has arrived from him.&nbsp;I've</li>
<li>already dragged people through legal proceedings because of it. A decision</li>
<li>hasn't been reached about it. The person I was negotiating with</li>
<li>over it without involving witnesses has refused me and sworn (Goitein: falsely), and all manner of&nbsp;</li>
<li>sinister things. The judges aren't deciding the matter,</li>
<li>the rayyis isn't free to sit in session, and if the judges sit</li>
<li>on their own, (the decision) they (make) won't be accepted. As for what's in the dār</li>
<li>al-wakīl, God knows that&nbsp;since&nbsp;I left the port,</li>
<li>&nbsp;I haven't paid a single dirham of what I owe on it.</li>
<li>The judges haven't come to a decision and they haven't set out&nbsp;</li>
<li>a settlement. I'm being cut off from every place. I repaid&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ibn al-Amshāṭī the seventeen dīnārs</li>
<li>and took his signature (on a quittance) and had the Nezer witness it,</li>
<li>and Faḍl b. Binyām and his brother in Alexandria</li>
<li>signed their attestations on his signature. I sent everything with</li>
<li>the elder Abū l-Makārim b. Qassāsa.</li>
<li>Let me know, my lord, whether the elder Abū l-Ḥasan b.&nbsp;</li>
