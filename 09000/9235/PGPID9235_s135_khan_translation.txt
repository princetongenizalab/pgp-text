Recto


The servant and slave




Mūsā ibn Ṣadaqa, the Jewish merchant.


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent peace and greetings be upon our master


and lord, the ’imām of our era and time, the ’imām al-'Amir bi-’Aḥkām Allāh, commander of the faithful, and upon


his pure ancestors and most noble sons, enduring benedictions, which last until the day of judgement. The slave kisses the ground


before the pure and noble prophetical presence, may God double its light and exalt


its beacon, and give victory to its armies, banners and helpers, and reports


that he arrived from India and Yemen with merchandise and (goods or money) in commenda


but it was detained by a pretext on which it was not lawful for it to be detained The slave had registered (documents)


in the court of the qāḍī,i Jalāl al-Mulk Tāj al-’Aḥkām in order to prevent [any dispute].




The slave humbly asks for a kindness to be bestowed upon him and a benefaction granted


to him by the issuing of an exalted rescript, may God increase its efficacy and nobility,


to the qāḍī,i Jalāl al-Mulk Tāj al-’Aḥkām (instructing him) to indicate what the slave has registered


with him, in order that this be a means of restoring his right to him, out of compassion


and commiseration for him. To our lord, the peace of God be upon his name,


belongs the exalted resolution in this, if God wills, he is mighty and glorious.


Praise be to God alone.


The blessings and peace of God be upon our lord Mujlammad the prophet and his family.
