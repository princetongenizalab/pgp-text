Recto


The servant Solomon son of R . Elijah, (may he come to a) g{ood) e(nd).


Oh you whose servant I am. I would hope from the grace of God


and from your grace that you work up something for me to expend on the Sabbath,


for I am in [financial] straits. You know that if I had anything


for the Sabbath expenditures I would not ask you for anything at all.


Do not disappoint me! May God in his mercy never disappoint


you. May he open for you his goodly treasures. Amen selah.
