<li>
<p>The servant Solomon son of R . Elijah, (may he come to a) g{ood) e(nd).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh you whose servant I am. I would hope from the grace of God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and from your grace that you work up something for me to expend on the Sabbath,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for I am in [financial] straits. You know that if I had anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the Sabbath expenditures I would not ask you for anything at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not disappoint me! May God in his mercy never disappoint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you. May he open for you his goodly treasures. Amen selah.</p>
