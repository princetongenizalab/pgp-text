Recto


Your admirer Solomon son of R. Elijah the judge, (may he come to a) g(ood) e(nd).


As time is short I am writing these lines


to my honorable brother, our master and teacher Bera'kho't,


the wise and understanding, the doctor, a choice part of the House of the Exilarch, as a sign


of my great longing for you, and my great desire


to see you. For the days and seasons have separated


us. May God, blessed be He, collect His dispersed ones


for His name's sake. I wrote you four letters,


"and there is no answer for the writings of Persia and Media." Your brother


is like you. For about six months he has not sent


me even one word. You be so kind


and greet him and his household. Your old grandfather,


greet him, too. Do not withhold your letters (from me)


in answer to mine. Greet the dignity


of the precious Turban, our master and teacher, (may his) R(ock) pres(erve him).


                the strong hammer, may his glory rise


and his honor increase].

"Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.” Judge me innocent. Peace.
