<li>
<p>Your admirer Solomon son of R. Elijah the judge, (may he come to a) g(ood) e(nd).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As time is short I am writing these lines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to my honorable brother, our master and teacher Bera'kho't,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wise and understanding, the doctor, a choice part of the House of the Exilarch, as a sign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of my great longing for you, and my great desire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to see you. For the days and seasons have separated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>us. May God, blessed be He, collect His dispersed ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for His name's sake. I wrote you four letters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"and there is no answer for the writings of Persia and Media." Your brother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is like you. For about six months he has not sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me even one word. You be so kind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and greet him and his household. Your old grandfather,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>greet him, too. Do not withhold your letters (from me)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in answer to mine. Greet the dignity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the precious Turban, our master and teacher, (may his) R(ock) pres(erve him).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                the strong hammer, may his glory rise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and his honor increase].</p>
</li>
</ol>
