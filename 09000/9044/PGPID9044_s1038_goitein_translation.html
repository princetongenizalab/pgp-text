<li>May God make permanent for my lord and master, the illustrious rayyis, his high rank, prestige, happiness and welfare, may he add continuously to his</li>
<li>high standing and prolong his life and splendor for his brethren and friends. May you always</li>
<li>enjoy the possession of esteem, eminent importance, sublime rank, praiseworthy ways of conduct, and rich gifts of the spirit. I am writing</li>
<li>early in the month of Sivan of the year 90 from the city of Granada, may God protect it.</li>
<li>After thanking God, the exalted and majestic, for his plentiful benefactions, there is no duty pressing on me and dear to me more than the pleasure of talking about you</li>
<li>and occupying myself with you, boasting of your acquaintance and making remarks in social gatherings</li>
<li>about your excellence and nobility and pointing out the spiritual gifts bestowed upon you by God, namely an overflow of religiosity, a strong faith,</li>
<li>praiseworthy chastity, godliness, and humility, learnedness, self-restraint, great philanthropy,</li>
<li>and many other rich gifts. He -&nbsp; may his name be praised - is to be entreated and his countenance to be supplicated that he may preserve your qualities</li>
<li>and protect your perfection from the vicissitudes of fate and, in his mercy, may let us always hear from you what gives us joy, not grief or anxiety.</li>
<li>Last year we received the distressing news of the two disasters that rapped</li>
<li>the ears and led the tears flow: the death of our lord, the head of the academy, and that of our lord, the Crown</li>
<li>of the Judges, your brother - may they rest in Eden. Would I try to describe how much our community was afflicted by this,</li>
<li>ink and pens would come to an end, but not my words. Your brave and noble soul knows well</li>
<li>that I share with my lord everything, may it be bitter or sweet, and, despite the great distance,</li>
<li>I should have come to you to express my sympathy and consolation. But there are</li>
<li>circumstances that render the fulfillment of obligations impossible. May God bestow upon the two the favor</li>
<li>befitting them, prolong your life after them, cool their graves, and be your company after they have left you.</li>
<li>You know that despite your being away from us, our love of you is renewing all the time. So, do us a favor and</li>
<li>send us a message telling us how you have been, stage after stage, from the day of your departure to the day of your arrival,</li>
<li>and all that has occurred to you, in general and in detail; and how you have found the upper layer of society.</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>Small and great (or: young and old) -&nbsp; may God elevate you all. Your communication will be an honor to us and a great favor. Knowing your noble mind and lofty character, God has been beneficent to you</li>
<li>and sent you the quintessence and embodiment of our country, our glory and leader, the illustrious scholar and unique and perfect devotee, r(abbi) Judah, the son of al-Levi m(ay his) R(ock keep him); how much do I regret to be separated from him and how heartily do I congratulate you on meeting him - may God the exalted</li>
<li>give you enjoyment one from the other. Let me hear about your meeting as much as is convenient. I need not repeat my request for a note from you, which will be a great favor to me, God willing. My most special, copious, and lavish greetings to you, my illustrious lord,</li>
<li>accompanied with overflowing yearnings after a meeting with you, only to be satisfied by the sight of your gracious countenance. Greetings also to the prominent notables accompanying you; may God enhance their position and bestow on them a good name.</li>
<li>In particular, I ask you to convey my most intensive and well scented greetings to my illustrious lord,</li>
</ol>

<li>the Pride of the Merchants,&nbsp; Abu l-Barakāt b. Ḥārith, my dear, special friend - may God elevate and protect him. Please convey to him</li>
<li>my excuse for not writing to him separately and including him in this letter.&nbsp;Accept also greetings from my brother Mūsa</li>
<li>and your paternal aunt and all our brethren in&nbsp;the country, potter and philosopher, bragger and cantors, and the community at large in accordance with their esteem</li>
