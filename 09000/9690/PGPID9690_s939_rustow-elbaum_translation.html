<li>&hellip; for he is master of this and has power over it, if God wills.</li>
<li>&hellip; on Monday 24</li>
<li>Ḥeshvan, (4)864, may God acquaint us with blessings&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;for us and the whole Jewish people. I departed from you (pl.) without having seen you,&nbsp;</li>
<li>and this was very difficult for me. I arrived safely in Alexandria,</li>
<li>and I was determined to return to you (pl.). Then I went up to Fustat,</li>
<li>where I ran into Makhlūf b. //Moshe, known as// Happy Eyes. I talked to him about&nbsp;</li>
<li>living in India, and he told me about its rural villages. It immediately entered</li>
<li>my mind to travel to India. We hadn&rsquo;t read (the verse in) Proverbs (that says),</li>
<li>&ldquo;The eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth&rdquo; (17:24). So I left Fustat at the end of</li>
<li>Iyar of the year (4)863. We reached Qūṣ in two months; then</li>
<li>I entered the desert and stayed there for some days. Then&nbsp;</li>
<li>I arrived in ʿAydhāb, which is truly a city of tribulations (ʿadhāb).</li>
<li>Then we departed, setting sail in a ship that contained not a single nail of iron,&nbsp;</li>
<li>but rather was tied together with ropes, may God protect us with his shield.</li>
<li>We arrived at a city called Sawākin, which is really a most frightening&nbsp;</li>
<li>place (akhaḍḍ mawākin). Then we arrived at a city called Bādiʿ (&ldquo;the one that cuts&rdquo;),</li>
<li>for it is just as the name says (cf. 1 Samuel 25:25), the most bitter, frightening, miserable of places.</li>
<li>Then we arrived at a city called Dahlak. The following adage is said</li>
<li>about it: &ldquo;But you surpass them all (Proverbs 31:29).&rdquo; It is a ruinous land (balad muhlik). In</li>
<li>any case, God, may he be powerful and exalted, didn&rsquo;t destroy us, in his mercy. In my haste,</li>
<li>when I met up with Avraham, the son of my paternal uncle ʿAllūsh, I didn&rsquo;t take</li>
<li>the bit of coral from him that he was keeping for you; it could have been a souvenir.</li>
<li>In any case, I swear to you by these very lines, by the [love] (between us)</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>by the bread and the cup</li>
<li>we&rsquo;ve drunk and eaten (together):</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t stop praying for me &mdash; not</li>
<li>you, not your mother, and not your maternal uncle</li>
<li>Yaʿqūb. I know you&rsquo;d (sg.) pray</li>
<li>for anyone; all the more should you pray for me,</li>
<li>your dear friend, and God, may he be exalted, will be gentle</li>
<li>in his mercy. As for me: man!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m about to cross the great</li>
<li>Sea &mdash; no mere sea of Tripoli, this!</li>
<li>Who knows if we&rsquo;ll ever meet again</li>
<li>or not? So I&rsquo;m asking God and you</li>
<li>to pray for me, and to forgive me,</li>
<li>you and your maternal uncle Yaʿqūb, for</li>
<li>&hellip; on account of&nbsp;</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>...</li>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>to bring me letters in Tripoli addressed to me except for you. Let it be a secret of &ldquo;steadfast faith&rdquo; (Isaiah 25:1).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let anyone read them or be informed about them, not him and not anyone else. May God&nbsp;</li>
<li>forgive and absolve you [singular] for what happened between us, you and your maternal uncle Yaʿqūb, in this world and the world to come.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have your mother convey greetings to my sisters, and have them pray</li>
<li>for me. Man! If I could pay 200 dinars to stop the ship</li>
<li>until the sea evens out, I would! But my trust in God alone is sufficient for me [as support]. Send</li>
<li>greetings to my blood-brother and your brother Abū Ismāʿīl. Then make him swear</li>
<li>that he won&rsquo;t leave me out of his prayers. Send greetings to Rav Zachariah and his children,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>may God keep them alive, and to my paternal uncle&rsquo;s son Moshe and his sisters. Send my maternal uncle</li>
<li>&nbsp;Yaḥyā and ʿAllūsh b. Avraham greetings. When he/they read(s)</li>
<li>this letter of mine, burn it, I beg you. Your humble servant kisses your hand, my lord.</li>
<li>&nbsp;I forgot to take my Seder Moʿed from the synagogue! If you need</li>
<li>it, take care of it, and if you think that it's better for it to stay in the house,</li>
<li>and that it&rsquo;s better &hellip; that it be there, do that, may God reward you. Seek&nbsp;</li>
<li>advice on this from my sister, my brother and your uncle Yaʿqūb. Send greetings to Khalfa,</li>
<li>the son of my son-in-law, and to Baqāʾ. Say hello to my sister&rsquo;s children.</li>
<li>&nbsp;God is my sufficiency and my trust.&nbsp;</li>
