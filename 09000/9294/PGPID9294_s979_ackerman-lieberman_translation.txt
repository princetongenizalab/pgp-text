Abraham ha-Kohen b. Aaron (who) r(ests in) E(den)and his employee Isḥaq b. Sa‘īd established between the two of themthat debt would be repaid which was owed this Abraham ha-Kohen by his employee,this Isḥaq, half a dirham each day; and that he would work for himuntil he pays what he owes, in return for two dirhams each day, in dull business conditions or active. If he leaves before paying in fulland requests his portion for the days (for which he is due) maintenance, his wage (will be)a dirham and a half each day; and he (Abraham) is (still) entitled to the quarter(-dirhams)  owed by him (Isḥaq) for the remainder.(Similarly,) if this Abraham evicts him in accordance with his will before his debt has been repaid,he is entitled to the amount at the rate of two dinars and a half each day.A qinyan was performed with each of them this Tuesday, the 17th of Tammuz 1438.
