Sa‘īd established between the two of them</li><li>that debt would be repaid which was owed this Abraham ha-Kohen by his employee,</li><li>this Isḥaq, half a dirham each day; and that he would work for him</li><li>until he pays what he owes, in return for two dirhams each day, in dull business conditions </li><li>or active. If he leaves before paying in full</li><li>and requests his portion for the days (for which he is due) maintenance, his wage (will be)</li><li>a dirham and a half each day; and he (Abraham) is (still) entitled to the quarter(-dirhams)  owed by him (Isḥaq) for the remainder.</li><li>(Similarly,) if this Abraham evicts him in accordance with his will before his debt has been repaid,</li><li>he is entitled to the amount at the rate of two dinars and a half each day.</li><li>A qinyan was performed with each of them this Tuesday, the 17th of Tammuz 1438.</li></ol>
