<li>according to his situation. Also, from the beginning</li>
<li>after their/our arrival (in Aden), his intent was to deceive</li>
<li>regarding everyone's letters. And it may be said</li>
<li>that I did not bring a letter.</li>
<li>Rather, someone else is bringing them,</li>
<li>even the letters of Yosef and Khalaf</li>
<li>and everyone (else), and R. Yaʿaqov's letter</li>
<li>as well, as he ordered, if there was one.</li>
<li>Then they all dispersed.</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Recto, right</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>If even one letter is delivered to Maḍmūn,</li>
<li>he will try to deliver</li>
<li>the letter of Rabbi Yaʿaqov letter according to Maḍmūn's</li>
<li>order and decision, as well as</li>
<li>the letters of the entire group, even if something arrives</li>
<li>from elsewhere, on his order,</li>
<li>and he will endeavor as much as possible to make *peace*</li>
<li>between them. Thus will both of them</li>
<li>aim to forgive,</li>
<li>take an oath and apologize.</li>
<li>He will write a testimony about the situation</li>
<li>and (about) forgiving them. He will endeavor</li>
<li>to get Maḍmūn to sign with his own hand</li>
<li>if he is asked about them. He will hurry to&nbsp;</li>
<li>it all, the night after</li>
<li>he arrives. Ibn Jamāhir's letter,</li>
<li>if it is necessary,</li>
<li>and (even) if it isn't, should be put aside. Another letter</li>
<li>will reach Yosef in the hands of al-Futīḥī</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>with the letters of the Nezer with</li>
<li>goods from [Bū] Saʿīd.</li>
<li>He will try to do what [the ray]yis deserves.&nbsp;As for the goods</li>
<li>[or m]oney of a refund during</li>
<li>[the g]athering &mdash; and it will take place , whether I go back to Egypt or whether I go to India - according to his opinion, after writing a letter informing him what was concluded and what happened. And what belongs to the tiara, will be sent to him by a faithful person, as well as the letters of the 'Reis', if you can find a Gentile to bring them, all the better. And if not, they will be attached to my letters to my brother. And he must be instructed not to read them but him. And also he wanted fifteen royal dinars - pearls and... for decoration, if they are found and they are cheap, and if not - they should be put away. And also to buy a slave for 'Rice', between a small pleasant one and a good small captive, between a captive '...Hadia' at the time of redemption from one of the battles?. He also deserves/will receive for him a precious stone for the ring, which will be for the purpose of beauty, and if not - it must be put away.</li>
