<li>according to his situation. Also, from the beginning</li>
<li>after their/our arrival (in Aden), his intent was to deceive</li>
<li>regarding everyone's letters. And it may be said</li>
<li>that I did not bring a letter.</li>
<li>Rather, someone else is bringing them,</li>
<li>even the letters of Yosef and Khalaf</li>
<li>and everyone (else), and R. Yaʿaqov's letter</li>
<li>as well, as he ordered, if there was one.</li>
<li>Then they all dispersed.</li>

                        <ol>
<li>Also, he wanted</li>
<li>fifteen Malikī</li>
<li>dīnārs, pearls and [...]l</li>
<li>to pierce, if it can be d[one]&nbsp;</li>
<li>inexpensively. If not, [let it go].</li>
<li>Also, buy a slave for the [R]ayyis,</li>
<li>whether a young, pleasant one or</li>
<li>a good</li>
<li>[ . . ] at the time of redemption</li>
<li>from one of the bat[t]les (?). In addition,</li>
<li>a precious stone should arrive from Maḍmūn</li>
<li>for the purposes of a ring,</li>
<li>If not, let it go.</li>

<li>If even one letter is delivered to Maḍmūn,</li>
<li>he will try to deliver</li>
<li>the letter of Rabbi Yaʿaqov letter according to Maḍmūn's</li>
<li>order and decision, as well as</li>
<li>the letters of the entire group, even if something arrives</li>
<li>from elsewhere, on his order,</li>
<li>and he will endeavor as much as possible to make *peace*</li>
<li>between them. Thus will both of them</li>
<li>aim to forgive,</li>
<li>take an oath and apologize.</li>
<li>He will write a testimony about the situation</li>
<li>and (about) forgiving them. He will endeavor</li>
<li>to get Maḍmūn to sign with his own hand</li>
<li>if he is asked about them. He will hurry to&nbsp;</li>
<li>it all, the night after</li>
<li>he arrives. Ibn Jamāhir's letter,</li>
<li>if it is necessary,</li>
<li>and (even) if it isn't, should be put aside. Another letter</li>
<li>will reach Yosef in the hands of al-Futīḥī</li>

<li>after writing a letter informing him</li>

<li>As for what happened to the Nezer,</li>
<li>it will be sent to him with a trustworthy person</li>
<li>along with the letters of the rayyis, f&nbsp;</li>
<li>you can find a gentile to bring them,</li>
