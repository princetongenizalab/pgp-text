according to his situation. Also, from the beginning
after their/our arrival (in Aden), his intent was to deceive
regarding everyone's letters. And it may be said
that I did not bring a letter.
Rather, someone else is bringing them,
even the letters of Yosef and Khalaf
and everyone (else), and R. Yaʿaqov's letter
as well, as he ordered, if there was one.
Then they all dispersed.

If even one letter is delivered to Maḍmūn,
he will try to deliver
the letter of Rabbi Yaʿaqov letter according to Maḍmūn's
order and decision, as well as
the letters of the entire group, even if something arrives
from elsewhere, on his order,
and he will endeavor as much as possible to make *peace*
between them. Thus will both of them
aim to forgive,
take an oath and apologize.
He will write a testimony about the situation
and (about) forgiving them. He will endeavor
to get Maḍmūn to sign with his own hand
if he is asked about them. He will hurry to 
it all, the night after
he arrives. Ibn Jamāhir's letter,

[the g]athering — and it will take place with me present,
whether I go back to Egypt or whether I go
[to] India — according to his opinion,
after writing a letter informing him
of what was concluded and what happened.
As for what happened to the Nezer,
it will be sent to him with a trustworthy person
along with the letters of the rayyis, f 
you can find a gentile to bring them,
If not, they will be enclosed in
my letters to my brother. He must be instructed
that no one must read them except for
him.
