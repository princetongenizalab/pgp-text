he will try to deliver
the letter of Rabbi Yaʿaqov letter according to Maḍmūn's
order and decision, as well as
the letters of the entire group, even if something arrives
from elsewhere, on his order,

take an oath and apologize.
He will write a testimony about the situation
and (about) forgiving them. He will endeavor
to get Maḍmūn to sign with his own hand
if he is asked about them. He will hurry to

he arrives. Ibn Jamāhir's letter,
if it is necessary,
and (even) if it isn't, should be put aside. Another letter
will reach Yosef in the hands of al-Futīḥī
