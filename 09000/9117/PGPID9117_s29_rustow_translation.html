<li>[My lord] and [mast]er, my pillar and support, my God perpetuate your glory and prolong your life</li>
<li>[and] power [ . . . ]. I had already sent a note to his honor my lord pouring forth</li>
<li>with utmost preparation in which I mentioned to him my arrival; then he sent letters to me with his messenger, with his well-known</li>
<li>graciousness and attention in everything possible. I thought about what [ . . . ] on his route, and I acted</li>
<li>[i]n a manner that followed from attachment. But success is achieved with God's favor and his.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The community has showered me with kindness, attention, frequent visits, kindness and hon[o]rs,</li>
<li>in a measure that embarrasses me. I partook of it outwardly, but God knows that inwardly</li>
<li>it weighed on me very much, since I didn't come for this kind of thing, and I wanted only its opposite,</li>
<li>isolation and solitude, since I'm nearly someone waiting for death</li>
<li>any moment. But as you know, under the influence of my principles/disposition/character, it wasn't possible</li>
<li>to do anything other than receive it in the spirit of kindness and to engage in it. As for the rayyis, ḥaver</li>
<li>and dayyan, my l[or]d and master who strives for your kindness, he has enslaved me and made me his servant</li>
<li>[ . . . and ma]de [i]t impossible for me to be absent or to hold back. There is no language to express my thanks</li>
<li>[to him . . . Perhap]s you can fill my role with a gracious and beneficent letter to him, as is your custom.</li>
<li>[ . . . ] whomever I showed part of your letter from your depression</li>
<li>[con]demned my tranquillity and and lack of (good) companionship, and i[n]quired of me abou[t] you, and I said that this was&nbsp;</li>
<li>[ . . . ] this caused me [p]ain and expanded (?). That soul</li>
<li>[ . . . ] may God relieve it of [ . . . ] and what it created for him&nbsp;</li>
<li>[ . . . ] who has wearied there every great person. For how is it until&nbsp;</li>
<li>[ . . . ] when suffering the affairs of the [ . . . ]&nbsp;</li>
<li>[only] God knows, anticipating [ . . . ]</li>
<li>He who is unique, may God be pleased witih h[im, . . . ]</li>
<li>[ . . . ] he is the [ . . . ]</li>

<li>[dis]dain for the world and the withdrawal of the soul. I am preoccupied with something [ . . . ] my mind has cooled off [ . . . ]</li>
<li>For the soul, looking expectantly for speed, redeems you. [ . . . ] He granted</li>
