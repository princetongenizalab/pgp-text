Recto

[My lord] and [mast]er, my pillar and support, my God perpetuate your existence and prolong your life
[and] elevate your power?* [ . . . ] my love (?). I have already sent a note to his honor my lord
in great haste in which I mentioned to him my arrival. Then he sent letters to me with his messenger, with his well-known
graciousness and attention in everything possible. I thought about what [ . . . ] on his route, and I acted
[i]n a manner that followed from attachment. But success is achieved with God's favor, (and only) then with his. 
The community has showered me with kindness, attention, frequent visits, kindness and hon[o]rs,
in a measure that embarrasses me. I partook of it outwardly, but God knows that inwardly
it weighed on me tremendously, since I didn't come for this kind of thing, and I wanted only the opposite of it,
isolation and solitude, since I'm nearly someone waiting for death
any moment. But as you know, under the influence of my principles, it wasn't possible
to do anything other than receive it in the spirit of kindness and to engage in it. As for the rayyis, ḥaver
and dayyan, my l[or]d and master who strives for your kindness, he has enslaved me and made me his servant.
[ . . . and ma]de [i]t impossible for me to be absent or to hold back. There is no language to express my thanks
[to him . . . Perhap]s you can fill my role with a gracious and beneficent letter to him, as is your custom.
[ . . . ] whomever I showed part of your letter from your depression
[con]demned my tranquillity and and lack of (good) companionship, and i[n]quired of me abou[t] you, and I said that this was 
[ . . . ] this caused me [p]ain and expanded (?). That soul
[ . . . ] may God relieve it of [ . . . ] and what it created for him 
[ . . . ] who has wearied there every great person. For how is it until 
[ . . . ] when suffering the affairs of the [ . . . ] 
[only] God knows, anticipating [ . . . ]
He who is unique, may God be pleased witih h[im, . . . ]
[ . . . ] he is the [ . . . ]

Recto, right margin

[dis]dain for the world and the withdrawal of the soul. I am preoccupied with something [ . . . ] my mind has cooled off [ . . . ]
For the soul, looking expectantly for speed, redeems you. [ . . . ] He granted
m[y mo]st exalted [lord] the oppressive on[es]

I pledge to his excellency most unwavering faith [ . . . ]
May he write to me with the favor of his apposite opinion [ . . . ]
[ . . . ] us in it from a commodity, and the commodit[y . . . ]

[ . . . ] you intercede for me with Ibn Barukh to the extent [ . . . ]
