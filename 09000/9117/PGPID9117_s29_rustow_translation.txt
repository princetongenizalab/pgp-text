Recto

[My lord] and [mast]er, my pillar and support, my God perpetuate your existence and prolong your life
[and] elevate your power?* [ . . . ] my love (?). I have already sent a note to his honor my lord
in great haste in which I mentioned to him my arrival. Then he sent letters to me with his messenger, with his well-known 
graciousness and attention in everything possible. I thought about what [ . . . ] on his route, and I acted
[i]n a manner that followed from attachment. But success is achieved with God's favor, (and only) then with his.
