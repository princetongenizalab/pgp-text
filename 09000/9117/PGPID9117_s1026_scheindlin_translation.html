                        <p>O master and lord, pillar and support, may God make your glory&nbsp;endure and give length to your days. . . . The note that I sent to you&nbsp;about your coming to . . . in which I mention to you that your letter&nbsp;arrived . . . with your customary kindness and attention to every&nbsp;manner. I was . . . after the entanglement, but . . . with God&rsquo;s grace&nbsp;and yours. The community showed me so much kindness and&nbsp;acceptance, acclaim, thoughtfulness, courtesy, and honor that I was&nbsp;embarrassed. I participated outwardly. . . . Inwardly, it was very&nbsp;burdensome for me. For I did not come for any of this, and all I&nbsp;want is its opposite&mdash;isolation and solitude&mdash;as appropriate for one&nbsp;who is near to expecting death any minute. But being of such an&nbsp;emotional character, as you know, I have no choice but to accept&nbsp;anyone who intends to do me kindness and to devote myself to him</p>
