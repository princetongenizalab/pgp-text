Recto
O master and lord, pillar and support, may God make your glory endure and give length to your days. . . . The note that I sent to you about your coming to . . . in which I mention to you that your letter arrived . . . with your customary kindness and attention to every manner. I was . . . after the entanglement, but . . . with God’s grace and yours. The community showed me so much kindness and acceptance, acclaim, thoughtfulness, courtesy, and honor that I was embarrassed. I participated outwardly. . . . Inwardly, it was very burdensome for me. For I did not come for any of this, and all I want is its opposite—isolation and solitude—as appropriate for one who is near to expecting death any minute. But being of such an emotional character, as you know, I have no choice but to accept anyone who intends to do me kindness and to devote myself to him. As for the chief, the rabbi and judge, my master and lord, he is devoted to it. He has made me his slave and his bondsman [so that I have neither . . . ] nor tongue to thank him. Do me the favor you have done in the past of writing a noble letter to him on my behalf . . . whom I have given your letter to read. . . . I shall copy . . . his intellect that this . . . and that soul. . . . God knows . . . my nature . . . with you in every calamity, all the more, to the point that . . . for the things that have befallen you

Verso
I adjure you by the strongest oath . . . to favor me by sending your solid judgment . . . our merchandise there. This merchandise . . . in silk . . . part of the silk . . . will benefit . . . if Ibn Barukh gets . . . Abu l-Majd. . . .
