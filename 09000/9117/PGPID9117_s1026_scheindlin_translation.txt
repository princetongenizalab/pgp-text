Recto
O master and lord, pillar and support, may God make your glory endure and give length to your days. . . . The note that I sent to you about your coming to . . . in which I mention to you that your letter arrived . . . with your customary kindness and attention to every manner. I was . . . after the entanglement, but . . . with God’s grace and yours. The community showed me so much kindness and acceptance, acclaim, thoughtfulness, courtesy, and honor that I was embarrassed. I participated outwardly. . . . Inwardly, it was very burdensome for me. For I did not come for any of this, and all I want is its opposite—isolation and solitude—as appropriate for one who is near to expecting death any minute. But being of such an emotional character, as you know, I have no choice but to accept anyone who intends to do me kindness and to devote myself to him
