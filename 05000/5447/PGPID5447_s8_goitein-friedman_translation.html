<p>In Your Name, O Merciful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The letter of your excellency arrived, my lord, the illustrious sheikh. May God prolong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your life and make permanent your well-being and safekeeping, your dignity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and happiness, your ascendancy, highness and loftiness, your support and elevated station!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May He not deny you His superior gift of success! May He crush whoever is envious of you and destroy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whoever hates you and is your enemy! This (will be) with His favor and generosity, God willing. You will be happy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to know&mdash;may God make permanent your honored position!&mdash;that I arrived from India in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complete safety. Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love, etc. &nbsp;I lack nothing but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>looking at your upright appearance. May God speedily facilitate our meeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the happiest of circumstances, when achieving the most delightful hopes,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God willing! God, the Exalted, has already facilitated my decision to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>return to India. May God, the Exalted, make the outcome good!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You mentioned, my lord&mdash;may God make your honored position permanent!&mdash;that the slave had arrived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I, your servant, am glad that he reached you in complete safety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You mentioned also the arrival of the articles that were with Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nahray b. ʿAllān. This made me happy. You had requested, my lord, a turban of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lānas silk. I sent you an exquisite (or: delicate) turban of lānas silk,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embroidered. I also sent another one for your father, and I wrote on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>every side separately, the name of its owner. You (pl.) should take delivery of this from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sheikh Abu ʾl-Riḍā son of the boy of Shamʿa. May God decree his safe arrival!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sent with him also a fine Qaṣṣī foot carpet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had hoped this year to travel home &nbsp;to Egypt,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but I was unable to come because of the state of gloom, &nbsp;which occurred. May God make</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the outcome good! Convey my best &nbsp;wishes to your mother,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and tell her of my longing for her. God willing, I shall strive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to travel home to you next year, at any rate, God willing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your excellency is greeted with best, profuse wishes. Convey for me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the whole family my best wishes. And all our coreligionists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and whoever asks for us are greeted with the best, profuse wishes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sheikh Abū Naṣr &nbsp;had sent with me for your excellency a bag, in which were</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>red copper wires. I sold it for seven mithqāls. Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Naṣr has (for you) two mithqāls, the proceeds of myrrh, which makes a total of nine mithqāls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I purchased for you (pl.) with them, sixty manns of ṭabāshīr. I have already delivered it to the most illustrious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sheikh Maḍmūn. He will forward it in the Kārim with whomever he finds suitable,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>since I am about to travel, and I have written this letter on the very day</p>
</li>
</ol>
