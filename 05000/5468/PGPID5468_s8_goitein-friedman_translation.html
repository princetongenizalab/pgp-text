                        <h3>Recto - main text</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>Thankful of his kindnesses,</li>
<li>
<p>Bū ʿAlī b. Bū ʿUmar. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My letter (to you)—may God give long life to your excellency, my lord, the most illustrious sheikh, the master, and prolong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His support of you, your elevated position, high rank and prominent station, and not deny you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His gift of superior success, crush those envious of you and destroy your enemies!—is to enquire about information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>concerning your situation and news about you, and the conduct of your affairs—may God, may His praise be glorified, conduct them as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you choose and to attain your goals! Were I to proceed to explain in detail even part of the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>longing and yearning for you, which I feel, the letter would not encompass it nor would speech contain it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But I pray to Him whose power and might are to be glorified to grant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quickly that I be reunited with you in the best of circumstances, in fulfillment of the most excellent hopes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>soon, God, the Exalted, willing. This is to inform you, my dear son—may [God, the Exalted,] streng[then you]!—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that I wrote you (pl.) a number of letters, but I have not received any answer from you (pl.). However,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know of news of you (pl.), but hear it only from (other) people. The situation, which I am undergoing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>namely the dearth of my possessions, is not something, which can be described, because of heartache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and how little I have. I remained perplexed by my situation, until I received from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sheikh Khalaf b. Maḍmūn thirty dinars, delivered by Sheikh Abu ʾl-ʿAlā b.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Naṣr . He is urging me to set out on a journey. I purchased the requisite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provisions for travel; then the Ghuzz swept down and plundered Minya. We departed naked, without</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a covering. I remained with a brick under my head, hungry, passing the night in grief, worn out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank God, had my life been in my hands, I would have given it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But Ibn Maḍmūn heard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of my dire situation and sent me letters, in which he said, “I have been afflicted by the same thing that you are enduring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set out and come up to me.” He (Khalaf b. Maḍmūn) informed me what had happened to the girl (‘the little one’) with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū ʿImrān, namely the hardships she had suffered with him. Had it not been for God and the assistance of the Sheikh (Khalaf),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who looked after her rights, she would have been lost. Their crisis reached the sultan, and Bū ʿImrān</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>converted to Islam. The malice between them increased, and he divorced her.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

                        <p>Recto, Right Margin:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>She remained with him in the best possible situation. Nothing remains for me but the journey. I traveled to ʿAydhāb, terrified and frightened by the ill-fated trip, but God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>decreed my safe arrival. Now I intend to set out for India. May God, may He be praised, make the outcome good again! Everything that I have heard about what you (pl.) are undergoing and your circumstances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increased my distress over you.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>Do not cut me off from news about you. I am traveling in faraway places. I hope that we shall be able to be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in one town until God decrees the appointed time (death) for me or for you. By God, by God, do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no cut off (sg. f.) your letters from me. We will not be reunited unless God wills. Accept for yourself (sg. f.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>profuse wishes for your complete well-being. And profuse wishes for Sheikh Abu ʾl-Maḥāsin’s complete well-being. And Peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Abū ʿUmar sends everyone profuse wishes for complete well-being.</p>
