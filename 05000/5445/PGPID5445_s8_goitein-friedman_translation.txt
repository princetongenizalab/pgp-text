Your distinguished letter, my lord, arrived, and it was the most perfect thing which arrived and the most satisfying to


come. Learning of your well-being and the good state of your affairs, my lord, gave me pleasure.


I thanked God, the Exalted, much for this and pray that He—may His praise be glorified!—


increase all good for you and let me hear from you good news


always, perpetually, through His kindness and abundant benevolence. I, your servant, was distressed


very much by the causes of your complaint, your sorrow and grief over


what befell the late Sheikh Hiba b. Abū Saʿd, your son-in-law, my lord,


namely that he and his partner the Kohen drowned, and that you had to undertake the support


of your daughter—may God protect her!—his wife, from the time he set out on his journey until now.


We have been afflicted by the same grief as you, my lord, and more so,


for a number of reasons: the anguish over the ship and its contents, since it


and most of its cargo belonged to our Nagid Ḥalfon—may his grandeur be elevated and his honor increase!—


and there was no one here who did not have some merchandise on the ship, everyone according to his amount,


including me, your servant, and others. Also the anguish over our two coreligionists, mentioned above,


and over two of our Adenese coreligionists, who were in


the ship and who were married in Aden. So there was general grief, from every aspect. 


But there is no stratagem against what God, the Exalted, has decreed. This is what God decreed


for them. This was their destiny. Let it be far from us and


the house of Israel! God save us from an end like this!


I pray to Him, blessed be His name, that He make the outcome good for my lord 


and for us and for all of Israel, in His abundant mercy and benevolence. You requested, 


my lord, that I, your servant, inform you how the tragedy befell


the two men mentioned above when they drowned and that I endeavor for your sake to secure the release of


the young woman and her share in what remains from her husband’s estate,


in Aden. Be informed—may I never know of any bad day for you!—that my explanation 


to you can be divided into three categories, since they are what is called for


here. The three aspects are: eyewitness accounts,


news heard at second hand and


what legal pronouncements there might be, whether clear-cut or otherwise, based on proofs


found in the statements of our sages. These are the details of their drowning.


The ship they were in, that is the Kūlamī, sailed from Aden together


with the other ships that set sail. This ship and the


Barībatanī were in the same position. The two of them traveled together for about four 


days out of Aden. On the eve of the fifth day, the sailors of the


Barībatanī heard the cries of the sailors of the Kūlamī


and their screams and shrieks in the night as the water inundated


them. When morning came, the sailors of the Barībatanī


did not encounter any trace or evidence of the Kūlamī, because


from the time the two had left Aden they had kept abreast of each other.


The two did not separate until this tragedy befell


the Kūlamī. This happened before they entered the Maṣabb.


Afterwards there appeared a ship’s wood and furnishings,


which were new, on the shore of Abyan and Shiḥr, and some of them were conveyed 


to Aden. There was no new ship with new rigging other than


the Kūlamī among the ships of that year, the year of the sinking of


of the Kūlamī. \\This is the report of some of our coreligionists concerning this and the report of some of the Barībatanī men concerning//\\the Kūlamī as well, made in the presence of the signatories to this letter.// Also there arrived travelers in ships


from the year in which the Kūlamī sank and the next year as well.
