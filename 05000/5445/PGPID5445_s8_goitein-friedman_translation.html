<p>Your distinguished letter, my lord, arrived, and it was the most perfect thing which arrived and the most satisfying to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>come. Learning of your well-being and the good state of your affairs, my lord, gave me pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thanked God, the Exalted, much for this and pray that He&mdash;may His praise be glorified!&mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase all good for you and let me hear from you good news</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>always, perpetually, through His kindness and abundant benevolence. I, your servant, was distressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>very much by the causes of your complaint, your sorrow and grief over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what befell the late Sheikh Hiba b. Abū Saʿd, your son-in-law, my lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>namely that he and his partner the Kohen drowned, and that you had to undertake the support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of your daughter&mdash;may God protect her!&mdash;his wife, from the time he set out on his journey until now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have been afflicted by the same grief as you, my lord, and more so,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for a number of reasons: the anguish over the ship and its contents, since it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and most of its cargo belonged to our Nagid Ḥalfon&mdash;may his grandeur be elevated and his honor increase!&mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and there was no one here who did not have some merchandise on the ship, everyone according to his amount,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including me, your servant, and others. Also the anguish over our two coreligionists, mentioned above,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and over two of our Adenese coreligionists, who were in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ship and who were married in Aden. So there was general grief, from every aspect.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But there is no stratagem against what God, the Exalted, has decreed. This is what God decreed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for them. This was their destiny. Let it be far from us and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the house of Israel! God save us from an end like this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pray to Him, blessed be His name, that He make the outcome good for my lord&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and for us and for all of Israel, in His abundant mercy and benevolence. You requested,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord, that I, your servant, inform you how the tragedy befell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the two men mentioned above when they drowned and that I endeavor for your sake to secure the release of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the young woman and her share in what remains from her husband&rsquo;s estate,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Aden. Be informed&mdash;may I never know of any bad day for you!&mdash;that my explanation&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to you can be divided into three categories, since they are what is called for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>here. The three aspects are: eyewitness accounts,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>news heard at second hand and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what legal pronouncements there might be, whether clear-cut or otherwise, based on proofs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>found in the statements of our sages. These are the details of their drowning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ship they were in, that is the Kūlamī, sailed from Aden together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the other ships that set sail. This ship and the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barībatanī were in the same position. The two of them traveled together for about four&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>days out of Aden. On the eve of the fifth day, the sailors of the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barībatanī heard the cries of the sailors of the Kūlamī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and their screams and shrieks in the night as the water inundated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>them. When morning came, the sailors of the Barībatanī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>did not encounter any trace or evidence of the Kūlamī, because</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the time the two had left Aden they had kept abreast of each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two did not separate until this tragedy befell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Kūlamī. This happened before they entered the Maṣabb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afterwards there appeared a ship&rsquo;s wood and furnishings,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which were new, on the shore of Abyan and Shiḥr, and some of them were conveyed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Aden. There was no new ship with new rigging other than</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Kūlamī among the ships of that year, the year of the sinking of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the Kūlamī. \\This is the report of some of our coreligionists concerning this and the report of some of the Barībatanī men concerning//\\the Kūlamī as well, made in the presence of the signatories to this letter.// Also there arrived travelers in ships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the year in which the Kūlamī sank and the next year as well.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
