<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>Your distinguished letter, my lord, arrived, and it was the most perfect thing which arrived and the most satisfying to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>come. Learning of your well-being and the good state of your affairs, my lord, gave me pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thanked God, the Exalted, much for this and pray that He&mdash;may His praise be glorified!&mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase all good for you and let me hear from you good news</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>always, perpetually, through His kindness and abundant benevolence. I, your servant, was distressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>very much by the causes of your complaint, your sorrow and grief over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what befell the late Sheikh Hiba b. Abū Saʿd, your son-in-law, my lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>namely that he and his partner the Kohen drowned, and that you had to undertake the support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of your daughter&mdash;may God protect her!&mdash;his wife, from the time he set out on his journey until now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have been afflicted by the same grief as you, my lord, and more so,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for a number of reasons: the anguish over the ship and its contents, since it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and most of its cargo belonged to our Nagid Ḥalfon&mdash;may his grandeur be elevated and his honor increase!&mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and there was no one here who did not have some merchandise on the ship, everyone according to his amount,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>including me, your servant, and others. Also the anguish over our two coreligionists, mentioned above,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and over two of our Adenese coreligionists, who were in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ship and who were married in Aden. So there was general grief, from every aspect.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But there is no stratagem against what God, the Exalted, has decreed. This is what God decreed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for them. This was their destiny. Let it be far from us and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the house of Israel! God save us from an end like this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I pray to Him, blessed be His name, that He make the outcome good for my lord&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and for us and for all of Israel, in His abundant mercy and benevolence. You requested,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord, that I, your servant, inform you how the tragedy befell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the two men mentioned above when they drowned and that I endeavor for your sake to secure the release of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the young woman and her share in what remains from her husband&rsquo;s estate,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Aden. Be informed&mdash;may I never know of any bad day for you!&mdash;that my explanation&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to you can be divided into three categories, since they are what is called for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>here. The three aspects are: eyewitness accounts,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>news heard at second hand and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what legal pronouncements there might be, whether clear-cut or otherwise, based on proofs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>found in the statements of our sages. These are the details of their drowning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ship they were in, that is the Kūlamī, sailed from Aden together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the other ships that set sail. This ship and the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barībatanī were in the same position. The two of them traveled together for about four&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>days out of Aden. On the eve of the fifth day, the sailors of the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barībatanī heard the cries of the sailors of the Kūlamī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and their screams and shrieks in the night as the water inundated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>them. When morning came, the sailors of the Barībatanī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>did not encounter any trace or evidence of the Kūlamī, because</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the time the two had left Aden they had kept abreast of each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The two did not separate until this tragedy befell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Kūlamī. This happened before they entered the Maṣabb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afterwards there appeared a ship&rsquo;s wood and furnishings,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which were new, on the shore of Abyan and Shiḥr, and some of them were conveyed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Aden. There was no new ship with new rigging other than</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Kūlamī among the ships of that year, the year of the sinking of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the Kūlamī. \\This is the report of some of our coreligionists concerning this and the report of some of the Barībatanī men concerning//\\the Kūlamī as well, made in the presence of the signatories to this letter.// Also there arrived travelers in ships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the year in which the Kūlamī sank and the next year as well.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>Travelers arrived in these two years in</li>
<li>
<p>ships from every sea: from all the lands of Hind and its provinces,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the land of the Zanj and its provinces, from the inland region of Berbera and Abyssinia and their provinces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and from Ashḥār and Qamar and their provinces. All</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the travelers came to Aden in those two years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And no news came to light of the Kūlamī or whoever was in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not even one man, at all,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no trace, no report, not anyone, who could tell an</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eyewitness account from someone who had been in it, not anyone who</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>could tell a report in his name, he or anyone who was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in it, except the story of the sailors of the Barībatanī,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which was sailing with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing else. Some say also that the new furnishings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the ship, which were found</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the shore of Abyan and Shiḥr, could</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have been from one of the ships of the land of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Zanj or from some other ship, which was not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the ships of Aden. No one disagrees,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rather all concur, that any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ship that sinks in the environs of Aden,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>between the Maṣabb and Aden, never</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>surfaces, nor does anyone who</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was in it survive at all,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because of the turbulence of the sea and the f[orce of its waves]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at {alt. Tr.: &hellip;and the distance from} the beach and the abundance of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fish (sharks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>is what we heard and what we verified from the sea travelers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from men of experience and from captains. And I have written this. Afterwards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I investigated the details of the matter for two Sabbaths in the synagogue, in the presence of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our Nagid Ḥalfon&mdash;may his grandeur be elevated and his honor increase!&mdash;and in the presence of the congregation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and in the presence of our coreligionists who had arrived from Egypt. And we affixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our signatures to what we had heard, the report of the sailors of the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barībatanī, a report related one from another, and to what we heard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from experienced and knowledgeable men about the drowning of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a ship and its contents between the Maṣabb and Aden, namely that it does not survive&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor does whoever was in it. People verified that the water inundated the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kūlamī, in this dangerous place, between</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Maṣabb and Aden, and it went down with whoever was in it. There did not surface from them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any man at all. Not only this ship, but also every ship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that sinks in this dangerous place and in the Maṣabb, never surfaces,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor does what was in it. Should we suppose&mdash;and this is something that will never be&mdash;that someone surfaced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the Kūlamī, which sank in the place mentioned above, he would not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emerge anywhere but at Abyan, Shiḥr or the city of Qamar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travelers journey back and forth from these places to Aden and vice versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no one there who says anything about the Kūlamī, nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about its survival or that of whoever was in it, only its total loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is all that we have clarified concerning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this in the presence of the congregation. One should take action accordingly. As to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>proof texts from the teachings of our sages, which are written concerning this. This is&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what they of blessed memory stated in the chapter &lsquo;A woman whose husband and co-wife went</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abroad&rsquo; in the Mishna: &ldquo;If he sank in water, whether in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a finite or infinite expanse,&rdquo; and what was written by the Geonim and the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>writers in their compositions concerning this, whether a leniency or stringency,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and if a woman contravened the rule and married, &ldquo;in the case of a bound woman the sages were lenient.&rdquo; This</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the like. We may not make a ruling to permit or prohibit in this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>case before those who are greater than us, our rabbis&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the judges of Egypt&mdash;may they be mentioned for a blessing!&mdash;because our responsum&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will arrive there. As far as we in our country are concerned, we have already verified</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the words of experienced and knowledgeable people from earlier generations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>until the present, that whatever sinks in the aforementioned locality cannot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>surface, neither it nor whoever was in it, other than wood and furnishings, which might&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or might not happen. The waves cast them only on the shore of Abyan,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a distance of one night from Aden, or at Aḥwar, a distance of about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three days, or at Shiḥr and the city of Qamar, a distance of about eight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>days at most or even less. From al-Sīf to these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>places, there being one beach to the Maṣabb, it is seven days. The sinking of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Kūlamī took place near the Maṣabb on the eve of the fourth day or the fifth, after it had set sail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from Aden. In this situation one cannot say &ldquo;The waves submerged him,&rdquo; because of the turbulence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the sea in that place and the abundance of the fish (sharks). And were the waves to submerge him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and carry him to another place, there are there no waves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which could submerge him (and carry him) to another place other than to those places mentioned above,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abyan, Aḥwar, Shiḥr and the city of Qamar, because the wind blows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>towards them. But when the ships sail, the kaws wind carries the ships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>away from Aden and from those places towards the Maṣabb and India. And whatever sinks at the Maṣabb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and nearby does not surface, ever, at any place whatsoever. This is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what any non-Jew says en passant and what experienced and knowledgeable people say about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the sea in those places mentioned above. I have gone into detail at length concerning&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this after investigations in public gatherings, so that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our rabbis the judges in Fustat&mdash;may they be remembered for a blessing!&mdash;might grant permission to you, my lord, accordingly. As to us in our place,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we will act according to what is clarified and apparent to us, for permitting this or forbidding it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is for your knowledge. This exposition has been written in two copies, this letter and a second</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>letter, because of the safe journey. To what we have verified and heard from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experienced and knowledgeable people, as detailed above, we have affixed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our signatures, so that action can be taken accordingly. May the well-being of all our rabbis and your well-being,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord, increase and never decrease! Much peace! May salvation be near! Adar I,&nbsp;</p>
