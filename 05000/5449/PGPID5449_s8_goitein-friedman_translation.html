                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>[...to] Aden. Immediately after his arrival [he was brought before the caliph?],</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who said to him: “Become a Muslim, or you will cause the death of [your] brethren [. . .] {read: the death of most of the [ Jews]}.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He cried bitterly, but there was no other way for him [...] {read: to e[scape]}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>except to embrace Islam. Before his arrival in Aden,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all those who were with him on the mountains had apostatized,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the physician (known as) the Efficient, and everyone on the mountains; only the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jews of Aden remained. But Sheikh Maḍmūn accepted Islam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on Wednesday, the first of Dhu ʾl-Qaʿda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Friday, the third, the bell (of the market-crier) was rung: “Community of Jews,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all of you, anyone who will be late in {alt. tr.: will refrain from} appearing in the audience hall after {add: tomorrow}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>noon, will be killed.” None of the Jews remained; all went up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the audience hall. Moreover, he (the caliph) ordered that anyone returning to the Jewish faith {alt. tr.: refusing to accept Islam}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would be killed. Thus all apostatized. Some of the very religious, who defected from {alt. tr.: refused to accept}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Islam, were beheaded. As to us, do not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask me what we felt,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>witnessing that day horrors the like of which we had never seen. {alt tr.: . . . how much our hearts were pained. We have never seen a worse day.} But God, the Exalted, wrought</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with us a miracle and saved us, not through our might and power {alt. tr.: not through our might and by the strength of [our] me[rit]},</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but through His grace and favor. For when we went up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with them to the audience hall, the foreigners assembled separately,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the caliph was consulted about them. God put these words into his mouth:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“No foreigner should be molested.” He ordered that everyone should</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pay a third of {alt. tr.: triple} the poll tax. We disbursed this, and he dismissed us {alt. tr.: and we were delivered}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>graciously {alt. tr.: in the best possible situation}, thank God. This</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is the upshot {add: of all} that happened. But, by the great God, I am really not able to convey to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even part of what happened, for witnessing an event is one thing and hearing about it—quite another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The merchants were outraged by {lit., ‘suffered from the indignation of’} the new</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>impositions promulgated. Finally, however, God, the Exalted, helped. He (the caliph) had ordered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that 15 out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of 100 dinars should be taken from everyone both at arrival and departure, but God helped,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and he {add: retracted this and} ordered that this Kārim should remain</p>
</li>
</ol>
