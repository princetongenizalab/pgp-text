Recto


[...to] Aden. Immediately after his arrival [he was brought before the caliph?],


who said to him: “Become a Muslim, or you will cause the death of [your] brethren [. . .] {read: the death of most of the [ Jews]}.”


He cried bitterly, but there was no other way for him [...] {read: to e[scape]}


except to embrace Islam. Before his arrival in Aden,


all those who were with him on the mountains had apostatized,


the physician (known as) the Efficient, and everyone on the mountains; only the


Jews of Aden remained. But Sheikh Maḍmūn accepted Islam


on Wednesday, the first of Dhu ʾl-Qaʿda.


On Friday, the third, the bell (of the market-crier) was rung: “Community of Jews,


all of you, anyone who will be late in {alt. tr.: will refrain from} appearing in the audience hall after {add: tomorrow}


noon, will be killed.” None of the Jews remained; all went up


to the audience hall. Moreover, he (the caliph) ordered that anyone returning to the Jewish faith {alt. tr.: refusing to accept Islam}


would be killed. Thus all apostatized. Some of the very religious, who defected from {alt. tr.: refused to accept}


Islam, were beheaded. As to us, do not


ask me what we felt,


witnessing that day horrors the like of which we had never seen. {alt tr.: . . . how much our hearts were pained. We have never seen a worse day.} But God, the Exalted, wrought


with us a miracle and saved us, not through our might and power {alt. tr.: not through our might and by the strength of [our] me[rit]},


but through His grace and favor. For when we went up


with them to the audience hall, the foreigners assembled separately,


and the caliph was consulted about them. God put these words into his mouth:


“No foreigner should be molested.” He ordered that everyone should


pay a third of {alt. tr.: triple} the poll tax. We disbursed this, and he dismissed us {alt. tr.: and we were delivered}


graciously {alt. tr.: in the best possible situation}, thank God. This


is the upshot {add: of all} that happened. But, by the great God, I am really not able to convey to you


even part of what happened, for witnessing an event is one thing and hearing about it—quite another.


The merchants were outraged by {lit., ‘suffered from the indignation of’} the new


impositions promulgated. Finally, however, God, the Exalted, helped. He (the caliph) had ordered


that 15 out


of 100 dinars should be taken from everyone both at arrival and departure, but God helped,


and he {add: retracted this and} ordered that this Kārim should remain
