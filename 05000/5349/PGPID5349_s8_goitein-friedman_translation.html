<p>You refer {alt. tr.: He refers} to the letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of [Fara]ḥ and… {read: Faraḥ, which was sent} from ʿAydhāb to Mr. Joseph, in which he says: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There arrived with us about 80 bales,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all of {or: the best of it} lac. We shall send this in installments,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so that it may reach the market.” To this I have to remark that this letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is of no avail for Mr. Joseph at all. For although</p>

                        <ol>
<li>
<p>we concede that these bales belong to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the partnership, we still need someone to prove to us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that those 22 bales were included in the 80</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentioned by them and were not part of something else. The proof</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the fact that they were not part of the partnership is that the letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him (to Joseph) says: “I shall send them in installments,” which proves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the bales, which he did not send to him,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>did not belong to the partnership. Had they sent them (the 22 bales) to him or to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the agent and instructed him to deliver them to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lebdi, as they did with regard to the aforementioned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(80) bales, they would have belonged to the partnership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, since they wrote to the agent letters in which they requested “Leave them {alt. tr.: Sell and leave their proceeds}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with you until we arrive, and there is no hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>above your hand,” they (the 22 bales) are excluded from the partnership with Mr. Joseph.</p>
