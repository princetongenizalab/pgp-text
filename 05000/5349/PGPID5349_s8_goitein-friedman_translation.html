<p>You refer {alt. tr.: He refers} to the letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of [Fara]ḥ and… {read: Faraḥ, which was sent} from ʿAydhāb to Mr. Joseph, in which he says: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There arrived with us about 80 bales,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all of {or: the best of it} lac. We shall send this in installments,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so that it may reach the market.” To this I have to remark that this letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is of no avail for Mr. Joseph at all. For although</p>

                        <ol>
<li>
<p>we concede that these bales belong to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the partnership, we still need someone to prove to us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that those 22 bales were included in the 80</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentioned by them and were not part of something else. The proof</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the fact that they were not part of the partnership is that the letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him (to Joseph) says: “I shall send them in installments,” which proves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the bales, which he did not send to him,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>did not belong to the partnership. Had they sent them (the 22 bales) to him or to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the agent and instructed him to deliver them to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lebdi, as they did with regard to the aforementioned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(80) bales, they would have belonged to the partnership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, since they wrote to the agent letters in which they requested “Leave them {alt. tr.: Sell and leave their proceeds}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with you until we arrive, and there is no hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>above your hand,” they (the 22 bales) are excluded from the partnership with Mr. Joseph.</p>

<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>First it is necessary to say to him: Who is it</li>
<li>who spoke of this or ever mentioned it? What necessity</li>
<li>requires mentioning this? When was it proven to us that</li>
<li>those people had a find or inheritance? Who mentioned it</li>
<li>or spread such a rumor about them in any way whatsoever,</li>
<li>so that we should say in their name</li>
<li>something that neither they said nor was said in their name? Nor did the heirs of</li>
<li>Farah?, who took their true share and</li>
<li>one of whom had been present with Farah? and this Abū Nasr?,</li>
<li>mention this in their name or consider it their right at all.</li>
<li>They rather took their share, acknowledged the truth</li>
<li>and went on their way. It is forbidden to mention this, because it has not been proven to us</li>
<li>and it was not said in their names and no rumor was spread of it by them or by anyone else.</li>
<li>It therefore becomes like nonsensical talk. I read the</li>
<li>passage from my words and from the words of the Judge&mdash; may the Merciful One protect him!&mdash;and I saw</li>
<li>the wickedness and evil his words contained and their lack of learning.</li>
<li>I adhere to my practice. But I clearly note</li>
<li>that should he attack me after this epistle,</li>

<li>As to his challenge to me </li>
<li>that I tell him who said this, my response is: those—</li>
<li>may their memory be for a blessing!—who said “He takes an oath and collects half,” namely the Judges of Eretz </li>
<li>Israel, whose words you should heed [. . .]} </li>

<li>I will not follow in his footsteps with words like his, because there is </li>
<li>no profit in this. It would be preferable for him to guard his tongue. Should he have </li>
<li>information, he should cite it and refute with good manners and abandon </li>
<li>bad manners and disparagement. That is a sign of fools. </li>
<li>For the present, I say no more...</li>
