Recto (catalogued as verso)

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

You refer {alt. tr.: He refers} to the letter


of [Fara]ḥ and… {read: Faraḥ, which was sent} from ʿAydhāb to Mr. Joseph, in which he says: 


“There arrived with us about 80 bales,


all of {or: the best of it} lac. We shall send this in installments,


so that it may reach the market.” To this I have to remark that this letter


is of no avail for Mr. Joseph at all. For although


 
Verso (catalogued as recto)


we concede that these bales belong to


the partnership, we still need someone to prove to us


that those 22 bales were included in the 80


mentioned by them and were not part of something else. The proof


for the fact that they were not part of the partnership is that the letter


to him (to Joseph) says: “I shall send them in installments,” which proves


that the bales, which he did not send to him,


did not belong to the partnership. Had they sent them (the 22 bales) to him or to


the agent and instructed him to deliver them to


Lebdi, as they did with regard to the aforementioned


(80) bales, they would have belonged to the partnership.


However, since they wrote to the agent letters in which they requested “Leave them {alt. tr.: Sell and leave their proceeds}


with you until we arrive, and there is no hand


above your hand,” they (the 22 bales) are excluded from the partnership with Mr. Joseph.
