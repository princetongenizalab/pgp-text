We, members of the court, assembled in the presence of our lord, the prince of God in our midst, our Nagid, Samuel the Nagid—


may his name be established forever!—in order to endeavor to deal with the estate of our master and lord Ḥalfon b. Shemaryā ha-Levi, known as Ibn Jumayhir,


who drowned in the Yemenite Sea, so that we might agree on what action to take in order to appoint a trustee, who would take care of the goods


and bring them to Egypt, since he left a minor son and two orphan girls and a widow. They require sustenance and (the girls need) a dowry for marriage, when they reach


their majority. We have agreed to hereby present our statement //with permission of our Nagid// to our prince and great one, our master and lord Maḍmūn, the prince and great one in Israel,


etc., who lightens the way for others and illuminates the unknown. ‘He whose hands are clean,’ like him, ‘grows stronger.’ He will not rest until he settles


the matter. He has been granted the merit to illuminate the eyes of those who are in the dark and to save the lives of orphans and a widow, such as these. The following is our statement


before [our prince]: Last year we heard a rumor from Gentile traders that the aforementioned man sailed


in the sea, that the ship in which he traveled was wrecked and sank //in the port of Aden//, and that he departed from life leaving it for us and all Israel. They (these merchants) said that the sea cast up his body, that he was buried in Aden


and that days later divers salvaged from the sea some of his goods, part of which reached your hands, our prince, because of your authority,


before the rulers (or: sultans) of the land seized the goods. On the basis of these words, which we heard from the Gentiles //at that point//, we did not consider it proper that we deal with and [. . .]


and take action by appointing a trustee and issuing him a power of attorney //to travel, proceed and undertake,// to take possession of the goods, because we believed that it is impossible that you, our prince, would not


inform us of the matter. We decided to wait until your report arrives, out of deference to you, and we determined that we would base on your report our decision on the action to be taken in this affair of the Jewish community. While


we were still discussing the case, your letter, ‘adorned with sapphires,’ our prince, arrived, in which you reported everything that had transpired.


We relied //on your report// and proceeded to search for a trustee, to act on your words //your letter//. Before we accomplished this, there arrived


three ⟦upright⟧ //Jewish// witnesses, namely So-and-so, So- and-so, and So-and-so, who testified in our presence, saying: We were indeed fully acquainted


with our master and lord Ḥalfon, when he was alive, and //most// familiar with him. When he was cast up from the sea, we saw him and recognized his appearance and looks. His appearance


had not been altered, and his face and nose were intact, without change. We were present at his burial. We accepted their //verbal// testimony, and it is


c[ertified and verified ] in a court record. Their testimony included what you, our prince, wrote, namely that the sultan seized whatever he seized,


[but that some of the goods] are deposited with you, our prince. After the report of your letter, our lord, and the report of those witnesses, we


proceeded to carry out our search and declared, “Whom shall we send? Who will go for us?”We did not find anyone suitable to carry out this important task. While


we were searching, we chanced upon our lord and master Abraham b. Joseph of al-Mahdiyya, known as Ibn Baqqāl, who was journeying to Yemen.


Some of us, among whom are signatories below, and some of the local elders and relatives of the orphans, contacted him and spoke with him about transporting and


taking possession of the goods held by you, our prince, and about suing, challenging and litigating with //under your authority, our prince,// anyone who is known to have had dealings with the dead man, in the fashion of all trustees


and agents, who take such actions. He demanded of ⟦us⟧ //them// a large fee, but ⟦we⟧ //they// offered eighty gold pieces for his fee.


He categorically refused to accept this. //We believe that because of his great haste, he did not actually mean this; and the matter was not settled. For// when they began negotiating with him, he already had his baggage on the ship, and he had one foot on the ship and one foot


on the ground. Neither he nor ⟦we⟧  //they// had time to resolve the matter. Before ⟦we⟧ //they// could blink, the anchor of the ship was raised, and he set out on his journey towards a safe arrival. Now—


may you be blessed of the Lord!—if you have empowered anyone else, he is acceptable to us and empowered by us, and we consider him


to be a trustee appointed by the court, to undertake obligations and benefits, to impose primary and secondary oaths, and to use any stratagems used by trustees of


the court. If you have not had the opportunity to do so and agree with us, this man, our master and lord Abraham, mentioned above, is worthy of this, if you can come to an understanding with him. We


shall agree with you and recognize him as the orphans’ trustee, to supervise their affairs in Aden, etc.}
