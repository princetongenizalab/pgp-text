Statement of account by Abū l-Bashar, as follows: A bale of lac weighing


two qinṭars gross and 89 raṭls minus the containers and tare, 14


raṭl. Net: two qinṭars 75 raṭls, at the rate of 16 dinars


per qinṭar. The price is 44 of the al-Mahdī dinars (minted 909–34 in Qayrawān), subtracting


two habbas from each dinar that will enter into my liability later. Because of the yellow color it contained


he received a discount of a half dinar. The balance is 43½ dinars after


the deduction, less weighing and transport, one and a half qīrāṭs. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

after the discount and the deduction of two habbas from the [total]


price. Two bales: 85 dinars, the weight of which is ...

The balance is 83½ dinars and a qīrāṭs and a habba. I paid


for the price of the wax. With the improvement in the face of the ʿAzīzī dinars,


a dinar and a half minus half a qīrāṭ. The balance to his credit, after that

I sold a jar of sindānī indigo the weight of which is 69 raṭls less


the container, 3 raṭls, net 66 raṭls. The rate:


33 rubāʿīs per qinṭār, deducting two habbas from each dinar.


The cost: 22 dinars minus a quarter-dinar. After the discount, its weight will be


21 dinars and five qīrāṭs and a habba. Subtract


from this the surcharge/tax, weighing and freight, half a dinar; the balance


is 21 dinars less seven qīrāṭs. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

4 raṭls, 63 raṭls, at the rate of 35 dinars per qinṭar of weight.


The cost after surcharge/tax and discount is 21½


dinars.

of 33 dinars per qinṭār of weight. The cost, after surcharge/tax and discount,


is 21 dinars less one eighth and a habba.

The total: 94 dinars minus one-third. To your credit, the price of the


lac was 10 dinars and two qīrāṭs. The cost is 104 dinars


minus one-quarter. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––


Received in the weight of the bale of maḥlab: 3 net qinṭars


after the tare of the container; the rate is 12 dinars and half a qinṭār, the cost

37 dinars and ½ a dinar for weighing. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

A bale of rose (petals?) was received the weight of which was 2 qinṭārs and 30 raṭls at a rate of


22 dinars per qinṭar, subtracting two habbas per dinar. The cost is


49½ dinars weighed, less the surcharge/tax, weighing and transport, which is 1½ dinars

less a qīrāṭ, the cost 3½ dinars and two qīrāṭs,


a total of 33½ dinars minus two qīrāṭs minus surcharge/tax of ½ 


dinar. The balance is 33 dinars minus two qīrāṭs and a habba because of the


basket, because it has absorbed moisture. If it weren't for Abū Yaʿqūb's sugar


we wouldn't have been able to get rid of it, because we sold it together with him. 


A cloth, cotton and ropes: ⅔ dinar and a qīrāṭ, a total of


119 dinars and two qīrāṭs. To your credit from the proceeds of the indigo and the balance from the proceeds


of the lac: 103¾ dinars. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––


The sum of the funds due to you in total will be 223 dinars less


one-sixth. I received a quarter-dinar from you minus a kharrūba


from the Mahdī dinars. They charged us a commission of a kharrūba for each 


dinar that we bought. –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––


You have three jars of nīl indigo for which we have not found a arrangement. You offered them at


18 dinars per qinṭār, but no one bought them from me. You left them


until God eased our affairs; if God hadn't eased


our affairs regarding the rose petals and maḥlab all of which I sold for you,


I would not have succeeded in selling them in the market, even in a year.


As God lives, my brother, I tried my best for your goods


and I made the biggest effort I could. If there had arrived
