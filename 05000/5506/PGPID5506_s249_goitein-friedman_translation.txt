Recto

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Another matter: You have disappointed (me) by having gone to Menaḥēm or spoken 
to him or requesting from someone to write a responsum. What I had requested 
of you is that you ask a query orally, hear the essence of the answer and write it to me. 
Even though I have already relied on (or, achieved) a proper (decision) in this matter,  I nevertheless want to consider 
someone else’s opinion.
