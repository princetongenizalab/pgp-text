Another matter: You have disappointed (me) by having gone to Menaḥēm or spoken 
to him or requesting from someone to write a responsum. What I had requested

Even though I have already relied on (or, achieved) a proper (decision) in this matter, I nevertheless want to consider 
someone else’s opinion.
