                        <p>Recto, Main Text:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>1-4: I [hope] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to receive [from you, my lord—may] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God [make permanent] your honored position!—[a letter, in which you honor me by asking me to take care of any of ] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your needs and propitious affa[irs . . .] [This is to inform you of ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my (his excellency’s servant’s) hardships [caused by the illness of my father in the month of . . . until]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his death, which was in the month of Adar—may he f[ind mercy! And I suffered, after]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his death, oppression at the hands of the rulers. And aside from that, [. . .] we have suffered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>here in the city and the entire land of Yemen tremendously high prices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and scarcity. Millet and wheat reached here a dinar for three mikyāls,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and even for a smaller quantity. All of the foodstuffs are costly, from the first to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the last. May God, the Exalted, make the outcome of all these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>matters good! The land has again become frightful now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for us, because of Sultan ʿAlī b. Abu ʾl-[Ghārā]t, since</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sultan Sabaʾ waged war with him and too[k . . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and destroyed al-Khaḍrāʾ, which was his (ʿAlī’s) stronghold [. . . He]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>left it only after extreme hardship [. . . which included. . . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and burning houses and plundering warehouses. Thank God, w[ho saved (?)]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the land. He (ʿAlī) had been a great oppressor of the people. The</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sultan Sabaʾ died shortly after this. And the land is still frightful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We pray that God, the Exalted, make the outcome good. I sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with Abu ʾl-Yumn a shipment to you and to the late Abū</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ʿImrān b. Nufayʿ. You, my lord, happened to travel, with the protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of God, and Abū ʿImrān passed away. And the condition of my lord al-Ḥalabī [. . .] nor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what he had with him and that with which he transacted, by God’s de[cree]. All of this is because of my bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>luck. Then the man die[d]. I received a letter from Sheikh Abū</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zikrī, who wrote that in a court session I, your servant, obtained (was awarded) seventy-seven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars minus one sixth. Perhaps this is one half of the (value of the) goods. But,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thank God, the Exalted, whatever was obtained from it is profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last year I wrote a power of attorney to the illustrious Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Zikrī, who acts in kindness to me and all [our comrades],</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because of his esprit de corps, generosity and virtue. Please accept for [your] estee[med self...] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>best wishes for your well- being.[...]</p>
</li>
</ol>
