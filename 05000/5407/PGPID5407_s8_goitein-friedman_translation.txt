1-4: I [hope] 


to receive [from you, my lord—may] 


God [make permanent] your honored position!—[a letter, in which you honor me by asking me to take care of any of ] 


your needs and propitious affa[irs . . .] [This is to inform you of ]


my (his excellency’s servant’s) hardships [caused by the illness of my father in the month of . . . until]


his death, which was in the month of Adar—may he f[ind mercy! And I suffered, after]


his death, oppression at the hands of the rulers. And aside from that, [. . .] we have suffered


here in the city and the entire land of Yemen tremendously high prices


and scarcity. Millet and wheat reached here a dinar for three mikyāls,


and even for a smaller quantity. All of the foodstuffs are costly, from the first to


 the last. May God, the Exalted, make the outcome of all these


matters good! The land has again become frightful now


for us, because of Sultan ʿAlī b. Abu ʾl-[Ghārā]t, since


Sultan Sabaʾ waged war with him and too[k . . .]


and destroyed al-Khaḍrāʾ, which was his (ʿAlī’s) stronghold [. . . He]


left it only after extreme hardship [. . . which included. . . .]


and burning houses and plundering warehouses. Thank God, w[ho saved (?)]


the land. He (ʿAlī) had been a great oppressor of the people. The


Sultan Sabaʾ died shortly after this. And the land is still frightful.


We pray that God, the Exalted, make the outcome good. I sent


with Abu ʾl-Yumn a shipment to you and to the late Abū


ʿImrān b. Nufayʿ. You, my lord, happened to travel, with the protection


of God, and Abū ʿImrān passed away. And the condition of my lord al-Ḥalabī [. . .] nor


what he had with him and that with which he transacted, by God’s de[cree]. All of this is because of my bad


luck. Then the man die[d]. I received a letter from Sheikh Abū


Zikrī, who wrote that in a court session I, your servant, obtained (was awarded) seventy-seven


dinars minus one sixth. Perhaps this is one half of the (value of the) goods. But,


thank God, the Exalted, whatever was obtained from it is profit.


Last year I wrote a power of attorney to the illustrious Sheikh


Abū Zikrī, who acts in kindness to me and all [our comrades],


because of his esprit de corps, generosity and virtue. Please accept for [your] estee[med self...] 


best wishes for your well- being.[...]
