<li>In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>The letter of his excellence, the most illustrious shaykh, my master&nbsp;and lord,&nbsp;has arrived.</li>
<li>May God preserve your prosperous state&nbsp;and make eternal your happiness! May He enhance</li>
<li>your comfort,&nbsp;raise your reputation,&nbsp;elevate your status in both worlds,</li>
<li>and crush&nbsp;your enemies and those envious of you! You mentioned, my master,</li>
<li>your longing and concern&mdash;may God concern Himself</li>
<li>in doing&nbsp;you good! May He avert from you sorrow and unite us</li>
<li>in complete&nbsp;happiness and in the best circumstances for which one can hope, with&nbsp;His favor</li>
<li>and might, God willing!&nbsp;This is to inform you&mdash;may God preserve</li>
<li>your honored position!&mdash;that I enquired with regard to your brother Mevasser&nbsp;and&nbsp;was informed that he was</li>
<li>well and in good health. Furthermore,&nbsp;I enquired whether he was traveling</li>
<li>to Eretz Israel, but the people&nbsp;whom I had asked said they did not know, but that he was well.</li>
<li>Had he come to Aden, I, your servant, certainly would have taken&nbsp;care of {alt. tr.: performed every courtesy for} him, even</li>
<li>without&nbsp;your instructions, my lord, to this effect {alt. tr.: concerning him}&mdash;God&nbsp;</li>
<li>beware (that I should not take care of him). {Alt. tr.: I, your servant, feel</li>
<li>regret on his account.}&nbsp;There arrived what you kindly sent, my lord, namely the betel nuts,&nbsp;the two locks&nbsp;and the two wooden qa a-bowls.&nbsp;And I have taken delivery of all this.&nbsp;I, your servant, sent</li>
<li>what has no importance or value, for</li>
<li>the children, namely two bottles of sugar, a bottle of almonds and two&nbsp;bottles of</li>
<li>raisins, altogether five bottles, all of them in the ship&nbsp;of Sheikh Maḍmūn,</li>
<li>which is going to Mangalore, through the&nbsp;agency of the purser {alt. tr.: nākhudā}.&nbsp;Please, my lord, take them&nbsp;from him.</li>
<li>Receive, my lord, for your esteemed self the best</li>
<li>greetings and give in my name to my lord, your boy, the best greetings,</li>
<li>and likewise to the brother Bama the best greetings in my name.&nbsp;Every year</li>
<li>you write that you are leaving for Aden, but nothing&nbsp;happens. May God, the Exalted,</li>
<li>ordain a happy conclusion!&nbsp;If you have any order</li>
<li>or require any service, please honor me&nbsp;with it.&nbsp;Written in the month of Av of the year</li>
<li>1459 E.D.&nbsp;I sent you also two dasts of</li>
<li>Egyptian paper. Please take notice of&nbsp;this. And Peace.</li>
