b. Mr. Shelomo Lebdi-may he rest in Eden-appeared in court and made this deposition:
"Mr. ʿArūs b. Mr. Yosef-may he Test in Eden-has testimony on my behalf I wish that it should be heard
and recorded." He presented to us Mr. ʿArūs, who made this declaration:
I remember having been together with Mr. Shelomo and his brother Yosef, the sons of Mr.
David Lebdi, in al-Mahdiyya.
They were {add: both} in one room {alt. tr.: apartment}, and all their
merchandise was in both their hands. I asked each of them
separately about their relationship. Each of them answered:
"We gave each other full power over all we have." Then they packed {add: some of}
the goods they had there. Mr. Shelomo traveled with some of them
to Spain, and Mr. Yosef took the remainder and joined
me. [God] ordained that Mr. Shelomo drowned with all that he carried with him.
When I {alt. tr. : we} heard this, I met with Mr. Yosef and asked him
what he was going to do. He said: "What shall I do? We have given each other full power
over everything we possess. It belongs to us jointly //as a partnership between us, even if it were only one dirhem//
The proceedings have been written down, etc.
