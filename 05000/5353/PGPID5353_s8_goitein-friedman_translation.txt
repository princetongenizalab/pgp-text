On Thursday, the 17th of the onth of Sivan
in the year 1410 by our
reckoning, in Fusṭāṭ, Egypt, on the river Nile,
Mr. David
b. Mr. Shelomo Lebdi-may he rest in Eden-appeared in court and made this deposition:
"Mr. ʿArūs b. Mr. Yosef-may he Test in Eden-has testimony on my behalf I wish that it should be heard

David Lebdi, in al-Mahdiyya.

"We gave each other full power over all we have." Then they packed {add: some of}
the goods they had there. Mr. Shelomo traveled with some of them
to Spain, and Mr. Yosef took the remainder and joined
me. [God] ordained that Mr. Shelomo drowned with all that he carried with him.
When I {alt. tr. : we} heard this, I met with Mr. Yosef and asked him
what he was going to do. He said: "What shall I do? We have given each other full power
over everything we possess. It belongs to us jointly //as a partnership between us, even if it were only one dirhem//


We wrote down and signed what happened before us in order that it would be a title of right and proof.
 Hanging between the lines: "A partnership between us, and we owe him a dirha[m],
altogether all of us. This is established and this is their confirmation:
