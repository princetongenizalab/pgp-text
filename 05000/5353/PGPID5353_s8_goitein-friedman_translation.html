<li>On Thursday, the 17th of the onth of Sivan</li>
<li>in the year 1410 by our</li>
<li>reckoning, in Fusṭāṭ, Egypt, on the river Nile,</li>
<li>Mr. David</li>
<li>b. Mr. Shelomo Lebdi-may he rest in Eden-appeared in court and made this deposition:</li>
<li>"Mr. ʿArūs b. Mr. Yosef-may he Test in Eden-has testimony on my behalf I wish that it should be heard</li>
<li>and recorded." He presented to us Mr. ʿArūs, who made this declaration:</li>
<li>I remember having been together with Mr. Shelomo and his brother Yosef, the sons of Mr.</li>
<li>David Lebdi, in al-Mahdiyya.</li>
<li>They were {add: both} in one room {alt. tr.: apartment}, and all their</li>
<li>merchandise was in both their hands. I asked each of them</li>
<li>separately about their relationship. Each of them answered:</li>
<li>"We gave each other full power over all we have." Then they packed {add: some of}</li>
<li>the goods they had there. Mr. Shelomo traveled with some of them</li>
<li>to Spain, and Mr. Yosef took the remainder and joined</li>
<li>me. [God] ordained that Mr. Shelomo drowned with all that he carried with him.</li>
<li>When I {alt. tr. : we} heard this, I met with Mr. Yosef and asked him</li>
<li>what he was going to do. He said: "What shall I do? We have given each other full power</li>
<li>over everything we possess. It belongs to us jointly //as a partnership between us, even if it were only one dirhem//</li>

<li>We wrote down and signed what happened before us in order that it would be a title of right and proof.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Hanging between the lines: "A partnership between us, and we owe him a dirha[m],</li>
<li>altogether all of us. This is established and this is their confirmation: </li>
