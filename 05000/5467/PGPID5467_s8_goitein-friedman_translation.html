<li>
<p>{[. . .] and refused</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give testimony. May the Exalted Creator call them to account!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scripture has already said, “Never trust Gentiles.”}  As to the news from here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and all that befell us since you left—to explain all this would take too much space,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and even if I filled ten leaves to describe only a part of what befell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>us, it would not suffice. I shall write concisely,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in particular as all our coreligionists, who departed from here, will inform you about what happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and what they heard and saw. In short, we fought {alt. tr.: bore up against} the enemy for two months,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the enemy being at sea and we on land. In the town remained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>neither high nor low {alt. tr.: neither grandee nor commoner}; everybody took refuge in the castles, while below the castles were only</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>empty houses and fighting {alt. tr.: enduring} the enemy; we faced each other {lit., ‘they looked at us, and we looked at them’}, but they did not dare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to land, while the people of the town had no vessels for attacking them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus each was afraid of the other. There assembled in the town about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2,000 men. Had there previously been in the town {add: with them} (even) 500, the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people would not have fled from their houses, but they (the soldiers) arrived only when the enemy had already entered the harbor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people remained far from their houses, until God overcame the enemy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and made the sea bad {alt. tr.: stormy}, while they (the enemy) were in Ṣīra  in the morning. They joined battle with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the people of the town, a number of them (the enemy) were killed near their (the people’s) houses, and their heads were cut off,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and what they had brought with them to Ṣīra was taken as booty, for they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had conquered Ṣīra and stayed there a night and a day,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the disaster befell them and they returned to their ships while our men</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>were on the land. Finally, Rāmisht’s two ships arrived. They (the enemy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tried {alt. tr.: went out towards them to try} to seize them, but the wind was good, so that they were dispersed on the sea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the right and to the left. The two ships entered the port safely, where they were immediately manned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with troops. (At this juncture,) the enemy could not do anything more, either in the harbor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or in the town. They retreated behind the mountain (of Ṣīra), until the wind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>became favorable for them and they made off. It would take too long to go into detail. In any case they left after</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>having been beaten and suffering heavy losses and humiliation. May God—praise to Him—preserve us from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their evil and never show us their faces again! {I would like to inform you that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have made a bold demand on your generosity, your good esprit de corps </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your virtue, by having shipped to you various (or: some retail) commodities, namely: a bag of pepper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weighing 303 pounds, a bag of Indian myrobalan weighing 303 pounds, a bag of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abyssinian cubeb weighing 300 pounds, a bag of lac weighing 300 pounds,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a small bag of saffron (zarnaba) weighing 90 pounds, a bag of Amlaj myrobalan weighing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>60 pounds,a bag of cassia weighing 60 pounds. All are precise (figures).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ask of your generosity, your good esprit de corps and your customary performance of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kindness, that you sell the shipment sent you for whatever price God, the Exalted, apportions as livelihood,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and buy for me (your servant) an exquisite Ṭalī robe, the most exquisite there is,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>five average, good Ṭalī robes, not mediocre,two pieces of cloth for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pillow cases, made by Ibn al-ʿĀsir.} The remainder should be with sharb {alt. tr.: made of sharb},</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether it is a mulāʾa wrap, a head cover, ʿarḍī, or ‘Sevener.’ {This should be average merchandise,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>neither very exquisite nor very inferior.} Also please buy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me six painted platters, made in Miṣr; they should be of middle size,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>neither very large nor very small; and twenty (regular) bowls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and forty small bowls. All should be painted and their figures and colors should be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different. {And (purchase) whatever kʾḥn and potions (perhaps read: platters and decanters) are readily available. Please pack this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in two good, strong baskets. Pack the robes in one bundle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is easy for you to send it all this year, good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is difficult to load it all, send me whatever is easy.}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>{Please send me your letter containing happy news about you</p>
