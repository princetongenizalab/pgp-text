                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>On Thursday, the fifth day of Kislev, in the year</p>
</li>
<li>1409 by our reckoning in Fusṭāt,</li>
<li>Egypt, on the river Nile,</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. David b. Mr. Joseph&mdash;may he rest in Eden!&mdash;(appeared before the court) and sued Mr. Joseph b. Mr. David</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the Lebdiyya family {alt. tr.: known as Ibn al-Lebdiyya}, after David&rsquo;s attorneyship had been established in court, for the gift made to Sheikh Abū</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zikrī Mr. Judah, the Chosen of the Yeshiva, b. Mr. Moses&mdash;may he rest in Eden!&mdash;by our lord and master</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moses, son of his honor, our lord and master Labrāṭ, the Head of the House of the Masters {alt tr.: rabbis}&mdash;may he rest in Eden!&mdash;namely fifteen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>units of corals, ten of the shākh (&lsquo;branches&rsquo;) kind and five diqq (&lsquo;chips&rsquo;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When asked about this, Mr. Joseph said: &ldquo;Concerning what he claimed, I do not know anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whatsoever.&rdquo; Then Mr. David, the attorney, produced evidence, namely that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>persons present in court said that when the letter of our lord and master Moses, the judge, had been read to him,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the (president of) the court asked him: &ldquo;What do you have to say about this?&rdquo; Mr. Joseph then replied:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Moses, the judge, sent with me scraps of coral chips in order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to sell them in Alexandria and (= or) Fustat. When I did not sell them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took them with me to Nahrwāra, sold them there and bought</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for them three flasks of musk, which I sold in Alexandria for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>13 &frac12; dinars.&rdquo; When he said to him: &ldquo;Will you deliver these 13 &frac12; dinars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to his (the judge&rsquo;s) uncle?,&rdquo; he replied: &ldquo;I have learned that the judge took from Daʾūd (David), the Tripolitanian Kohen,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what I had asked some of my relatives in Tripoli to send me, which they did,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but which arrived in al-Mahdiyya after my departure, namely, a sum of 10</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Murābiṭī dinars. Moreover, I had deposited silversmith tools belonging to my brother with the judge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When my brother arrived in al-Mahdiyya and asked the judge to return them to him, he told him: &ldquo;These are my collateral for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 dinars.&rdquo; He took from him 10 (al-Mahdiyya) dinars, but informed him that the tools</p>

<li>
<p>had been taken when Raqqat al-Mahdiyya was ransacked, and only a hammer remained, which he delivered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him. Said the Court to him: “If this report turns out to be false, will you still withhold from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the judge what belongs to him? You had better buy him goods for that sum and let him have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the profit to be derived from it.” He (Lebdi) replied: “I am prepared to do this and shall take the goods with me, for I am</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>traveling there.” When the Court remarked to him: “The (Ibn Sughmār’s) attorney might not be pleased,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the goods were in your hands,” he replied: “I am prepared to do this with [alt. tr.: to have them in the hands of] a third party,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and if the judge has got what belongs to him, the goods plus profit will be mine,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>otherwise they will be his.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceedings have been written down, etc.</p>

<p>Abraham b. Jacob—may his soul dwell in bliss!—Derʾī. \\Hillel b. Eli.//</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solomon ha-Kohen b. R. Joseph, ‘Father’ (of the Yeshiva)—may the memory of the righteous be blessed.</p>
