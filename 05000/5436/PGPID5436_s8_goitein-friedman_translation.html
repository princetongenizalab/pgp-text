<li>I am writing to you—may God prolong the life of my lord, the illustrious Sheikh, and make</li>
<li>his honored position and well-being permanent and crush his enemies!—to tell you how much I long</li>
<li>and yearn for you. I ask God to grant that we be reunited,</li>
<li>in the best of circumstances through His grace and bounty. Your letter to</li>
<li>my lord, the illustrious Rayyis—may God make his honored position permanent!—has arrived. You mentioned there that Tamīm</li>
<li>had arrived with the cloves and the aromatic wood. Sar Shālōm</li>
<li>Ibn al-Shāmī previously wrote to you to deliver my share to my lord, Sheikh</li>
<li>Abū Yaʿqūb al-Ḥakīm, for he is my agent, empowered to collect this, namely</li>
<li>17 manns of cloves, of which he (Sar Shālōm) noted that seven were exclusively his</li>
<li>and that of the 10 manns and the 7 manns of aromatic wood, two thirds were mine and one</li>
<li>third his. Also carried with him (Tamīm) 12 Malikī dinars for expenses {alt. tr.: tolls} for the</li>
<li>10 manns of cloves and 7 manns of aromatic wood. Please check</li>
<li>the letter of Ibn Bundār, which arrived with Tamīm, examine</li>
<li>the shipment and take out for me what belongs to me. You wrote</li>
<li>to my lord, the illustrious Rayyis, concerning the silk,</li>
<li>which we (= I) had sent to Sheikh Abū Naṣr Ibn Shaʿyā, namely 40 pounds</li>
<li>of good khazz. I ask you to attend to this and to its sale, on two months’ credit,</li>
<li>for whatever price God, the Exalted, apportions.</li>
<li>Please do not withhold from me your letter, (in which you charge me) with any service or errand, </li>

                        <p>I wrote to you about Abū Saʿd b. Rashīd—may God have mercy upon him!—and what he had deposited with Sar Shālōm, namely 75 Egyptian dinars, his investment, making 300 (Malikī) dinars. You know that the orphans, two girls, are poor. Please tell his excellency, the illustrious </p>

<li>for this will be a pleasure to me, and write in detail in it about all that I asked you. Accept </li>
<li>my most cordial personal regards and please greet Sheikh Abu ʾl-Ḥasan al-Dihqān,</li>
