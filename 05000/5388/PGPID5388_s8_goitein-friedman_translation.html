                        <h3>CUL Add.3418: Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>A barrel of fluid storax, weighing 50 manns exactly. He received it from ʿArūs, but it is mine. A purse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with 20 fresh dinars of excellent mint. (He continued): “I paid also the expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the customs in {alt. tr.: I paid also the toll of the customs of} Fustat and the boat’s freight for everything to {add: the port of} Qūṣ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sent everything with him to sell and buy for me whatever God would grant {lit., ‘facilitate’}.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I told him: “If God grants you {lit., ‘facilitates your’} safe arrival in Aden, send</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for me one half of this shipment by the agency of Ḥasan b. Bundār to Manībār {or: Munaybār},</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pepper country, to buy for me pepper, and the other half should be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with you until you come to Nahrwāra, where you will buy lac for me with it, and bring everything back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with you.” The aforementioned Mr. Joseph was asked about this and replied: “I received from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bundle of textiles and arrived with it at Dahlak. In Dahlak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I noticed that textiles sold well there; so I sold the best pieces. The proceeds of this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>were 60 good first-class mithqāls, ⟦and there remained with me⟧ together with what had remained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of it and was sold in Aden. As for the silver vessels, I received them from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and delivered them to Ḥasan b. Bundār, the agent, as he had ordered me ⟦for buying⟧.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lichen ⟦and the copper⟧ was also handed over by me to Ḥasan b. Bundār, who sold it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and added its proceeds to the 60 dinars, for which I had sold the textiles and which I had delivered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him. He owes also the proceeds of the storax, of which I had sold in Dahlak a quantity worth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40 dinars in local currency equivalent to ten good mithqāls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These I handed over to Ḥasan b. Bundār, together with the dodder of thyme, the scammony</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the cover of the textiles. I took the remainder of the dry storax and the corals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Nahrwāra. As far as the barrel of fluid storax is concerned,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I received it from ʿArūs, but settled the account for its price with Mr. Jekuthiel</p>
</li>
</ol>

                <div data-canvas="https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/iiif/MS-ADD-03421/canvas/1">
                    
                    
                    
                        <h3>CUL Add.3421: Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>prior to my departure, and he has no claim to it.” We asked Joseph about the proceeds from the remainder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the dry storax and the corals, which, as he said, had gone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with him to Nahrwāra. He answered:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storax, after the deduction of costs for transport {alt. tr.: after the toll} and the dues, brought</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>120 (local) dirhems. As to the corals, I bartered them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for beads. A part of these were lost at sea. The remainder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is in a bag of sharāb (fine linen), which is here. The proceeds from the storax were added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by me to the shipment entrusted to me, and I bought for it the {alt. tr.: whatever} goods he wished to have,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which I delivered to him in accordance with the accounts made with him. Then he was asked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with regard to the advance given to him by Ḥasan b. Bundār on account of the pepper. He replied:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aforementioned Ḥasan lent me, on account of 50 bahārs pepper,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>five dinars for each bahār, of which there were for ⟦Sheikh⟧ Mr. Jekuthiel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15 bahārs, of which ⟦three were bahārs of {alt. tr.: for} iron {alt. tr.: silk}⟧ one fourth were for iron {alt. tr.: silk}. Then Joseph was asked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how much the storax sold in Dahlak weighed. He replied: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I sold them two manns for one dinar, the total proceeds amounting to 80 manns,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>worth 40 dinars (of the currency) mentioned above. When I arrived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>here, he argued with me concerning the goods entrusted to me and there was much wrangling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>between us. As a sign of good will I delivered to him in exchange for that merchandise a load</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of lac worth 100 dinars and lent {lit., ‘advanced’} him another 100 dinars on account of the pepper to be sent {lit., ‘his assets held’} </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by Ibn Bundār.” Asked about this, Mr. Jekuthiel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>replied: “As to his statement about the 200 dinars, I did indeed receive</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>from him these 200 dinars in the way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he described, but they are due me.” On this Mr. Joseph remarked:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“As to those 100 dinars, which I advanced him on account of his assets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Aden; if the shipment arrives safely and will be worth more than 100, the balance belongs to him,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and if it is less, he is permitted, as from now, to keep the remainder (of the 100 dinars advanced).” In addition, Mr. Joseph</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>said during the session: “I gave him these 200 dinars expressly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a final settlement of all (our accounts).”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proceedings have been written down and signed to serve as a confirmation of rights and a proof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hillel b. R. Eli may his memory be blessed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abraham b. R. Shemaʿya, Fellow (of the Yeshiva)—may his soul dwell in bliss and his children inherit the land!—descendant of Shemaʿya, the Head of the Yeshiva—may he rest in Eden!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Solomon ha-Kohen, son of R. Joseph, ‘Father’ (of the Yeshiva), the memory of the righteous is blessed!</p>
