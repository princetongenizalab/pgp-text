For a good memory and rest for the souls.
In memory of the noble family, the family of scholars.
Our master and lord Joseph, the wise and discerning—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest!—
and his three sons. At their head, the distinguished, esteemed crown of glory,
our master and lord Peraḥyā the Excellent Judge—
may the memory of the pious be for a blessing! His brother, his honored, our great and holy master and lord Samuel
the teacher, the wise and discerning—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest!
And his brother Moses, snatched away after short years—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest!
And may there be life and peace for his honor our m[aster and lord] Zakkay,
the wise and discerning teacher! May God grant him male progeny,
for life and continued existence!}
