<li>For a good memory and rest for the souls.</li>
<li>In memory of the noble family, the family of scholars.</li>
<li>Our master and lord Joseph, the wise and discerning—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest!—</li>
<li>and his three sons. At their head, the distinguished, esteemed crown of glory,</li>
<li>our master and lord Peraḥyā the Excellent Judge—</li>
<li>may the memory of the pious be for a blessing! His brother, his honored, our great and holy master and lord Samuel</li>
<li>the teacher, the wise and discerning—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest!</li>
<li>And his brother Moses, snatched away after short years—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest!</li>
<li>And may there be life and peace for his honor our m[aster and lord] Zakkay,</li>
<li>the wise and discerning teacher! May God grant him male progeny,</li>
<li>for life and continued existence!}</li>
