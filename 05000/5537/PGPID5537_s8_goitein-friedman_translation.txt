The balance of the account from the bṣʾrh (biṣāra?) 3 m.
The kādār (!)—may God curse him!—owed him 14 m.
for (an order of ) two bahārs cardamom, which he did not deliver. I bought for him
instead two bahārs from Fandarayna for 17 m.
Thus I paid for him three m. more, plus the freight of the cardamom, which was one m. and a half.
His credit: 14 m., the proceeds of four bahārs ‘refurbished’ iron (sold) in Manjarūr.
For this, I bought for him from Fandarayna six bahārs
‘smooth’ iron in two jūniyas (bags), price 12 m., freight
two m., which makes the account even. The bags and the expenses {alt. tr.: tolls} are included
in the price; they were one eighth of a m. ⟦Total of his debt⟧ His debit {alt. tr.: expenditures charged him}:
damage of two fīliyā {alt. tr.: fīlīs} m., a rawbaj //and a negligible sum// making ⟦one eighth⟧ one sixth of a m.
Total: 75 m. less on third.
Balance in his favor: one m. and one quarter, with which the whole account is closed {alt. tr.: after all accounting}.
