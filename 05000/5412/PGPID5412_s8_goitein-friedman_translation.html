<li>
<p>[...on the package at] the top of the container [there was a note]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in my handwriting, on which was written: “I found this package. I don’t know who</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deposited it with me. It will remain until its claimant arrives.” Consequently,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the community knew that it belonged to your excellency. I swear by He who created me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and created you and by He who decreed my safety on sea and land, where</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I traveled and arrived safely—I had not been informed and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had no knowledge that it belonged to your excellency. No doubt you, my lord, laid it aside in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the warehouse, as you were accustomed to do, for the warehouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was at your disposal and no one denied you access to it. No doubt the slave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>threw the package in the container. I, your servant, know nothing about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And your excellency did not call attention to it among the things that you had mentioned, and I, your servant, had no knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that it was yours. And when your excellency traveled to Barūṣ, I searched</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the container and found the package and wondered to whom it belongs. Therefore,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote a note and left it inside. I, your servant, traveled and did not—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear by God!—open the package and did not see what was in it, because it was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bound by a rope—even if I, your servant, should have snatched</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it when I had that trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But God did not let me derive any blessing or wealth from it, either in this world or in the hereafter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your excellency only said these words, no doubt, because I</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had dropped in your esteem, because of my trouble. And I, your servant—far be it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from your excellency!—I don’t believe that you are capable of such a thing, not even</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in your innermost thoughts. Men may suffer, my lord, from injury and leprosy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the like. There is no escaping what God has decreed,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor anything to do, my lord, about intentions. Concealed acts concern the Lord our God; the overt acts [concern us], etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lord, a man cannot praise himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the foreigners traveling to Egypt and others know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about everything. As to the package of clothing, the late Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maḥrūz  acquired it at a reduced price from the man who collected its proceeds from my sons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likewise, your esteemed letter (to me) and letters to my sons reached me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they contained harsh words from your excellency. But my lord is absolved of any blame,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for I, your servant, could not have written this letter unless there remained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no grudge whatsoever against [you] in my heart. And you are absolved of blame in the broadest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sense of the word, //in this world and the hereafter,// with a pure heart. Likewise, when you write an answer to me, your servant,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you should consider me forgiven in this world and in the hereafter. To err is only human.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By God, my lord, my master, [I, your servant,] was saddened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by the paucity of your letters and [. . .]</p>
