IB II,28 verso

Your servant Maḍmūn b. Ḥasan b. Bundār—may he rest in Eden! In Your name, O Merciful.
Your letter has arrived, my lord, the eminent, most illustrious elder. May God lengthen your life,
make permanent your honored position and well-being, protect your soul from the vicissitudes of fate,
crush with disdainful humiliation those envious of you and your enemies! May He not deny you His superior
gift of success! ⟦May He crush with disdainful humiliation those en⟧ May He be
for you a supporter and a guardian! I read it and comprehended its contents.
As to the longing, which you mentioned, my lord, I (your servant) have twice
as much (for you). May God grant a reunion with you! I (your servant) took note of
what you wrote concerning your shipment of red and white betel nuts.
It arrived and I (your servant) took delivery of it. Similarly the pepper.
All that you mentioned in your letter arrived, and I (your servant) delivered to Sheikh
Yūsuf b. Ibrāhīm and Sheikh Khalaf all that you had written
should be delivered to them, and they received it. The details of the sale of pepper
and what was exchanged for it, I (your servant), include in the copy of your account, which is
attached to my letter. Familiarize yourself with it, your eminence, God willing.
You wrote about your decision to
come to Aden, and that the only thing that prevented you was your fear that people would say that
something had made you act in haste. I (your servant) spoke with the ‘auspicious
lord’ concerning you, and I took from him a pledge of protection. So you should resolve to come,
God willing. You have nothing to fear. This is better than your staying
in the land of India, for if, God forbid, your appointed time overtakes you,
all that you have will be lost, and your children will join…

[...] the price [...] and thirty dinars. And in the purse, were fifteen Malikī dinars. The total that you owe is 260 ¾ dinars. The balance of your debt is three quarters, hereby waived. It will be collected from you when you arrive, God willing.

…the wards of the state. This is my advice to you. Do not offer justifications
of any sort. You wrote about shipping
goods, purchased with forty Malikī dinars of
your money, to Egypt, to your brother Mevassēr. I (your servant)
had decided not to burden anyone with the shipment,
because of the talk that had reached me, namely that he was a good-for-nothing. [However,]
because of the high regard in which I (your servant) hold your eminence, I shall undertake to send [it].
[I shall take care of ] sending it, if someone departs this [year for]
Egypt, since no one arrived last year or [so far this year]
from Egypt, because of the [death (?)]
and epidemic prevailing there, for two years in a row. Recently [of the]
people, a small boat arrived with four merchants on board who reported
that the situation in the country (Egypt) had improved. Prices had fallen, and the government [was in control].
May God— may He be praised and exalted!—grant relief
to all people! As to the dinar, which you mentioned, which was yours
for the piece of copper, I (your servant) added it to your account.
Sheikh A…b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān was delayed

[...] and seven [...] and three quarters [...] which you wrote to send to [your] br[other] Mevassēr, forty dinars. I sent to you in the ship of \\al-Muqaddam// with the nākhudā [Ja]whar al- Muqaddamī—may God decree its safe arrival!—a purse, in which were [...] less [...]

[...n]inety [...] they took it [...]
[...] there was no opportunity for unpacking and repacking. Its total weight is
one bahār and ninety pounds. The price is one hundred and
twenty-six dinars and one dinar exit tolls from the port (of Aden). 
It was transported in the ship of Ibn al-Muqaddam
with Jawhar. With him there is also a purse [in which are]
eighteen Malikī dinars [and another in which are (?)]
one hundred and forty-five [Malikī] dinars.
[And no]thing remains in your credit. I did not pay the nākhudā [of the ship]
freightage for the piece of copper. This is for your information. [Peace.]}
