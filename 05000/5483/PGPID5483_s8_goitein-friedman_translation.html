<li>Your servant Maḍmūn b. Ḥasan b. Bundār—may he rest in Eden! In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>Your letter has arrived, my lord, the eminent, most illustrious elder. May God lengthen your life,</li>
<li>make permanent your honored position and well-being, protect your soul from the vicissitudes of fate,</li>
<li>crush with disdainful humiliation those envious of you and your enemies! May He not deny you His superior</li>
<li>gift of success! ⟦May He crush with disdainful humiliation those en⟧ May He be</li>
<li>for you a supporter and a guardian! I read it and comprehended its contents.</li>
<li>As to the longing, which you mentioned, my lord, I (your servant) have twice</li>
<li>as much (for you). May God grant a reunion with you! I (your servant) took note of</li>
<li>what you wrote concerning your shipment of red and white betel nuts.</li>
<li>It arrived and I (your servant) took delivery of it. Similarly the pepper.</li>
<li>All that you mentioned in your letter arrived, and I (your servant) delivered to Sheikh</li>
<li>Yūsuf b. Ibrāhīm and Sheikh Khalaf all that you had written</li>
<li>should be delivered to them, and they received it. The details of the sale of pepper</li>
<li>and what was exchanged for it, I (your servant), include in the copy of your account, which is</li>
<li>attached to my letter. Familiarize yourself with it, your eminence, God willing.</li>
<li>You wrote about your decision to</li>
<li>come to Aden, and that the only thing that prevented you was your fear that people would say that</li>
<li>something had made you act in haste. I (your servant) spoke with the ‘auspicious</li>
<li>lord’ concerning you, and I took from him a pledge of protection. So you should resolve to come,</li>
<li>God willing. You have nothing to fear. This is better than your staying</li>
<li>in the land of India, for if, God forbid, your appointed time overtakes you,</li>
<li>all that you have will be lost, and your children will join…</li>
</ol>

<li>…the wards of the state. This is my advice to you. Do not offer justifications</li>
<li>of any sort. You wrote about shipping</li>
<li>goods, purchased with forty Malikī dinars of</li>
<li>your money, to Egypt, to your brother Mevassēr. I (your servant)</li>
<li>had decided not to burden anyone with the shipment,</li>
<li>because of the talk that had reached me, namely that he was a good-for-nothing. [However,]</li>
<li>because of the high regard in which I (your servant) hold your eminence, I shall undertake to send [it].</li>
<li>[I shall take care of ] sending it, if someone departs this [year for]</li>
<li>Egypt, since no one arrived last year or [so far this year]</li>
<li>from Egypt, because of the [death (?)]</li>
<li>and epidemic prevailing there, for two years in a row. Recently [of the]</li>
<li>people, a small boat arrived with four merchants on board who reported</li>
<li>that the situation in the country (Egypt) had improved. Prices had fallen, and the government [was in control].</li>
<li>May God— may He be praised and exalted!—grant relief</li>
<li>to all people! As to the dinar, which you mentioned, which was yours</li>
<li>for the piece of copper, I (your servant) added it to your account.</li>
<li>Sheikh A…b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān was delayed</li>

<li>[...] finding [...] </li>

<li>It was transported in the ship of Ibn al-Muqaddam</li>
