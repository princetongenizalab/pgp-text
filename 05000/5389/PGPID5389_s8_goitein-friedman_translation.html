<li>
<p>but they were the price of indigo which he had bought from the House of Raisins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in addition to [indigo bought for] the aforementioned 40 dinars.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then Joseph, too, stated: “As to the 40 dinars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for which he sues me: The aforementioned 100 dinars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have paid to him. Moreover, he wrote a promissory note</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for 33 ⅙ dinars and one qirāṭ to Sheikh Abū Naṣr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manṣūr b. Azhar, which he had owed him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I shall clear him from this debt and return to him this note,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which he wrote for Sheikh Abū Naṣr. He (Jekuthiel) owes me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>four dinars for occasional payments made for him. There remains a debt to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of 2 ⅔ + ⅛ dinars. As soon as he demands payment,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will pay in cash.” The proceedings have been written down, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nethanel b. Japheth—may he rest in Eden! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isaac b. Samuel—may he rest in Eden! Nissīm, son of the Rav Nahray—may the memory of the righteous be blessed!</p>
</li>

<p>&hellip;Mr. Jekuthiel claimed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that he had sold to Joseph indigo from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the House of Raisins against clearing a sum of 40</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars, which he, Jekuthiel, owed the Agency House of the Qadi Abu ʾl-Ṭāhir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Joseph had guaranteed that he would settle the account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the House of the Qadi {add: for them, in his name}. Meanwhile some time had passed,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and &ldquo;these days I was sued by the House of the Qadi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the aforementioned amount. I request him (Joseph) now to clear me from this.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When asked about this, Joseph replied: &ldquo;I paid Mr.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekuthiel these 40 dinars; they were included in the 100</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars, and no claim remains against me in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Against this, Mr. Jekuthiel declared:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I have received from him these 100 dinars,</p>
</li>
</ol>
