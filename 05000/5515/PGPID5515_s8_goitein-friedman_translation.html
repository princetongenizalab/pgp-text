<li>[...] I, the servant of</li>
<li>your excellency, inform you—may God make your prosperity permanent!—</li>
<li>that when you departed from me {alt tr.: I departed from you}, I went to the house;</li>
<li>and the hand mill and the durra crusher were in the house. I locked</li>
<li>the house and departed and entrusted Sheikh Ḥusayn with the care</li>
<li>of the house, which he was prepared to do (lit., ‘the man said only “good,’”).</li>
<li>Qays, however, was angry and said: “He lost the house’s</li>
<li>furnishings and rent.” In fact, I, your excellency’s servant, inform you</li>
<li>that Sheikh Ḥusayn received payment of</li>
<li>the entire rent and that you have not suffered any loss</li>
<li>from the house. Therefore, when he reaches Aden and talks</li>
<li>to you, my lord, about this matter, do not accept</li>
<li>his words (as true) {alt. tr.: do not take notice of his words} nor be distressed or</li>
<li>worried by them. If you, my lord, have any {alt. tr.: Whatever, you, my lord}</li>
<li>need or require any service, honor your servant </li>
<li>with it. To you, my lord</li>
<li>and master, and to my lord Peraḥyā—may his Rock preserve him!—the best greetings. And peace.</li>
