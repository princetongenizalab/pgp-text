[...] I, the servant of
your excellency, inform you—may God make your prosperity permanent!—
that when you departed from me {alt tr.: I departed from you}, I went to the house;
and the hand mill and the durra crusher were in the house. I locked
the house and departed and entrusted Sheikh Ḥusayn with the care
of the house, which he was prepared to do (lit., ‘the man said only “good,’”).
Qays, however, was angry and said: “He lost the house’s
furnishings and rent.” In fact, I, your excellency’s servant, inform you
that Sheikh Ḥusayn received payment of
the entire rent and that you have not suffered any loss
from the house. Therefore, when he reaches Aden and talks
to you, my lord, about this matter, do not accept
his words (as true) {alt. tr.: do not take notice of his words} nor be distressed or
worried by them. If you, my lord, have any {alt. tr.: Whatever, you, my lord}
need or require any service, honor your servant 
with it. To you, my lord
and master, and to my lord Peraḥyā—may his Rock preserve him!—the best greetings. And peace.

Kindly do not cease writing to me, the servant of your excellency. May I never be deprived of you!
