After I had written you and shipped a few commodities with Abu ʾl-Riḍā
b. Hilāl, all of the ships returned [...] and I had to
stay here, until I return my merchandise to the warehouse and lock it. then I'll come up (to Fustat),
God willing. I hope that we extricate ourselves from here this week, God willing. Don't ask,
my brother, what aggravation I had from the return of the ships, because I lost many
dues, expenditures, provisions and sizeable custom fees, from which I cannot recoup
one dirhem. I also shipped other merchandise to al-Mahdiyya, which came back. May God make
the outcome good! [...]
...
God knows how distressed I was
to have to stay here. I swear by these lines, were I to find a way not to sleep here
one night, I would not sleep here. This is for your information, my lord.

If the wheat in the house is depleted, buy for me two
or three dinars worth, which we shall eat until the wheat,
which you wrote that Musallam has for me arrives. Do not neglect
the wheat, for it is one of the most essential things.
And write to

recto, right margin

Musallam
to the deposit for you in
Akhmīm two irdabbs of wheat or
three, to serve you as provisions for the journey,
God willing
