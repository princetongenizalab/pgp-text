<li>After I had written you and shipped a few commodities with Abu ʾl-Riḍā</li>
<li>b. Hilāl, all of the ships returned [...] and I had to</li>
<li>stay here, until I return my merchandise to the warehouse and lock it. then I'll come up (to Fustat),</li>
<li>God willing. I hope that we extricate ourselves from here this week, God willing. Don't ask,</li>
<li>my brother, what aggravation I had from the return of the ships, because I lost many</li>
<li>dues, expenditures, provisions and sizeable custom fees, from which I cannot recoup</li>
<li>one dirhem. I also shipped other merchandise to al-Mahdiyya, which came back. May God make</li>
<li>the outcome good! [...]</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>God knows how distressed I was</li>
<li>to have to stay here. I swear by these lines, were I to find a way not to sleep here</li>
<li>one night, I would not sleep here. This is for your information, my lord.</li>
<li>...</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>If the wheat in the house is depleted, buy for me two</li>
<li>or three dinars worth, which we shall eat until the wheat,</li>
<li>which you wrote that Musallam has for me arrives. Do not neglect</li>
<li>the wheat, for it is one of the most essential things.</li>
<li>And write to</li>
</ol>

<li>Musallam</li>
<li>to the deposit for you in</li>
<li>Akhmīm two irdabbs of wheat or</li>
<li>three, to serve you as provisions for the journey,</li>
<li>God willing</li>
