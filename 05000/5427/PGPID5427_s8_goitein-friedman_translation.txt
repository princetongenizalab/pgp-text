recto (IB II, 17)

The letter of my lord, the most illustrious elder, has arrived—may God make permanent 
your well-being, may He guard your life and humble those who envy you! It was
a most gladdening letter and a most delightful message. I was happy to learn of your well-being
and your prosperous circumstances, and I have entreated God (to grant you) more of every good thing,
in His mercy. I noted that you mentioned in your esteemed letter
that you had sent some pepper in the ship of the nākhudā 
Rāmisht—twelve bahārs of small measure.
This has arrived and (I) your servant went to collect it. From this is to be deducted

verso, Hebrew address (IB II, 17)

(To) The most illustrious elder, my lord Abraham
Ben Yishū—May God preserve your well-being!
(From) Your servant Maḍmūn
b. al-Ḥasan b. Bundār.
