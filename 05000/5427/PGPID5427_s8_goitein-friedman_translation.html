                        <ol>
<li>The letter of my lord, the most illustrious elder, has arrived—may God make permanent </li>
<li>your well-being, may He guard your life and humble those who envy you! It was</li>
<li>a most gladdening letter and a most delightful message. I was happy to learn of your well-being</li>
<li>and your prosperous circumstances, and I have entreated God (to grant you) more of every good thing,</li>
<li>in His mercy. I noted that you mentioned in your esteemed letter</li>
<li>that you had sent some pepper in the ship of the nākhudā </li>
<li>Rāmisht—twelve bahārs of small measure.</li>
<li>This has arrived and (I) your servant went to collect it. From this is to be deducted</li>
