Testimony given before us, the undersigned [. . . that]


Joseph Lebdi—may God be pleased with him!—son of R. David [before he set out on the voyage],


from which he did not return to Miṣr [made in our]


presence a last will which we have taken down in his name. [He did so while being in full command of his mental faculties,]


without being coerced. We performed with him the symbolic act of obligation[. . .]
