In Your name, O Merciful.
A Blessed Memorandum carried by Sheikh Abū Nasr b. Mūsā (?) al-H alab[ī].
May God decree his (= your) safe arrival! For his servant Joseph b. Abraham.
I sent with you (my lord) a bag of pepper, weighing one bah[ār] and forty pounds.
[. . . God] the Exalted [. . .]
Kindly sell this for whatever God, the Exalted, apportions, and buy [for me (your servant)]
an exquisite Anatolian (?)  thawb (robe), fifty cubits long;  a ma{tiqa (?)  [. . .]
. . . exquisite, with a fine silken or golden decoration and [. . .]
cubits (?), golden; a ‘fulled’ Sūsi robe, forty cubits
long; two exquisite checkered, ‘fulled’ Sūsī fūṭas; two kerchiefs,
raw (not ‘fulled’), exquisite. The two sides of each kerchief should be decorated with [. . .] marks.
By my instructions, my lord, buy for me (your servant) only exquisite clothing,
the most exquisite you can buy! Also purchase a washing basin
[. . .]. It should be an attractive basin, the diameter one and a half handbreadths14 or a little more.
[On] its upper [. . .], engraving or writing. It should be without an ewer.
[But] if it is easy for you to acquire an attractive ewer, buy it for me. Also please
deliver in my (his servant’s) name to my lord Sheikh //Rabbi// Isaac and Rabbi Ḥalfon sons of (?)
the scholar (?), the cantors of the synagogue, five Egyptian mithqāls. 
Greet them in my name and apologize for me (your servant) to them concerning the (small)
gifts of honor. I had wanted to write to them a letter in the days of
Sukkot [. . .] to them. Buy for me (his servant)
with the balance whatever your su[cce]ssful opinion decides [. . .]
Maghrebi [kohl] and raw (?) kohl  . . . the eye [. . .]
gold and silver embroidery and whatever merchandise you decide to purchase, which is easy to acquire. If you (my lord)
are able to arrive here this year, fine. If not, please [send these purchases]
