                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In Sawākin: 1 Egyptian mithqāl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remaining 20 of the thawbs (robes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that had been bought were used for the payment of customs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They were sold {alt. tr.: There remained 20 thawbs (robes, or: thawb units) from all the clothing, which had been purchased, and they were used for the payment of customs; they were sold} in Sawākin for 10 dinars which sum was spent for the payment of customs in ʿAydhāb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The man who received (the goods of) Ibn al-Ṭuwayr paid in ʿAydhāb the remainder of the second customs in Bāḍeʿ and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the balance of the customs in ʿAydhāb. The hiring of the camels {alt. tr.: the camel driver.} and the customs in Qūṣ and Fustat were also paid by him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goods were brought to the house of Ibn al-Ṭuwayr. He sold of them what was due him (from al-Nafūsī) {alt. tr.: due him for his expenditures},</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the rest remained with him. Not one single dirhem worth of this accrued to me,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor have I received {add: from him} of its proceeds any goods or anything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A small sum {alt. tr.: a little/some merchandise} remained in my hands,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which was spent on the house bought {lit., &lsquo;collected&rsquo;} for him (al-Nafūsī).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Berākhōt, son of the elder R. Joseph</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lebdi&mdash;may he rest in Eden!&mdash;appeared before us and declared that he had dictated this entire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>account, and that all that remained with him, besides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what went into the house of Ibn al-Ṭuwayr, was spent on the house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>belonging to Sheikh Isḥāq al-Nafūsī&mdash;may his Rock preserve him!&mdash;which is registered in his name,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after it was bought by ʿAllūsh {lit., &lsquo;which is part of what ʿAllūsh bought&rsquo;} in the name of his brother Isḥāq&mdash;may his Rock preserve him! In this are included</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 dinars, which he (Nafūsī) had promised to the beadle Barakāt, the Kohen, b.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ʿAmmār. After all this, nothing worth even a penny has remained with him (Barakāt Lebdi)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from all that had been delivered to him. We wrote this as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a confirmation of rights and a proof. This happened on Tuesday, the seventh of Shevat 1443</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.D. He said that these expenses were made on the instructions of Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Saʿīd, his honor, great and holy master and lord Ḥalfon ha-Levi&mdash;may his Rock preserve him!&mdash;son of our lord Nethanel ha-Levi&mdash;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may his memory be blessed!&mdash;the representative of the aforementioned Sheikh Isḥāq. Sheikh Abū Saʿīd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confirmed that he had ordered these actions, because he had regarded them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as beneficial. We wrote this too, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Judah ha-Kohen b. Joseph ha-Kohen&mdash;may his end be good!&mdash;offspring of Yehōsēf Kohen Sedeq&mdash;the memory of the righteous is blessed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zechariah b. Sar Shālōm&mdash;may he rest in Eden!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\\Ḥalfon ha-Levi b. Manasseh&mdash;may he rest in Eden!//</p>
