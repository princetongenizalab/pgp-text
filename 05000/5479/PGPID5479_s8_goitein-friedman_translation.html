<li>4 1/8&nbsp; dinars. And also, in the ship of the nākhudāAbu &rsquo;l-Ḥasan,</li>
<li>a piece of lead; the weight: two hundred and sixty pounds; the price:</li>
<li>17 1/3 dinars; the export tax from the Furḍa, 1/3&nbsp; d.; (Bama)</li>
<li>has one dinar for buying water and cabin equipment. Your total</li>
<li>debt: 653 dinars. Balance in your favor:</li>
<li>32 dinars. {Add: Your debit:} Sent to you with Abu &rsquo;l-Khayr,</li>
<li>32 dinars. I have sent to you with Sheikh Abu</li>
<li>&rsquo;l-Khayr and Bama a gift from me to you: 10 (?) rubāʿiyyas of</li>
<li>sugar and raisins, as well as a dast of white paper. As for the paper, for two years now</li>
<li>it has been impossible to get any (in the market), and I have given you this from (the stock)</li>
<li>I keep for myself.&nbsp; I have sent you a piece (made) of corals for your son Surūr</li>
<li>and a quarter {add: mikyāl} of seeds. Please be sure to take delivery of all this.</li>
<li>Together with my letter, a letter from Makhlūf &lsquo;The Orphan&rsquo;was dispatched to you,</li>
<li>which he had sent from ʿAydhāb. I have more than twenty of his</li>
<li>letters, all of them worthless {alt. tr. utterly confused}&mdash;he is an old man in his dotage, and has become senile</li>
<li>in his old age {alt. tr.: utterly confused at the end of his life} and doesn&rsquo;t know what he is doing. As for the documents,</li>
<li>which I had made out in Muslim and Jewish (courts), wherein he releases</li>
<li>you from any claim, demand, responsibility or oath, they are in my</li>
<li>safekeeping and are certified by reliable witnesses.</li>
<li>You mentioned the betel nuts, which you had sent to me with</li>
<li>Sheikh ʿAbd al-Malik last year, and the two boards (of teak wood),&nbsp; I took delivery of</li>
<li>this and sent you last year in exchange, with Saydān,</li>
<li>sugar, raisins, and other {add: retail} items, but God ordained what He ordained. As for the remaining</li>
<li>boards, Sheikh Joseph and Sheikh Khalaf&nbsp; took delivery (of them)&mdash;they were</li>
<li>owed them from the year (before). As for the drky,&nbsp;none has come this year</li>
<li>at all. And I was not able to get any indigo. Concerning what you mentioned about</li>
<li>Musallam al-Kaʿkī,&nbsp; he has not sent you a thing this year, nor have I</li>
<li>seen a letter of his. Please accept for yourself and your son the best of greetings from me,</li>
<li>and convey my best regards to the illustrious nākhudā ʿAlī al- Fawfalī.</li>
<li>And peace! Know, my lord, that in the ship of the nākhudā</li>
<li>Rāmisht and in the ship of his two sons and two brothers-in-law {alt. tr.: and in the ship of his son and (the ship) of his son-in-law},&nbsp; and in the ship of</li>
<li>the nākhudā Abu &rsquo;l-Ḥasan b. Abu &rsquo;l-Katāʿib, four ships . . .</li>

<li>In each ship there is a bundle of letters for you and for Abraham</li>
<li>b. ⟦Yishū⟧ \\Fayyūmī//,&nbsp; for all the Bānyāns of Mangalore, for the nākhudā</li>
<li>al-Fawfalī, and for ʿImrān and Saʿīd. Please be sure to take delivery of</li>
<li>them all and take good care of them. Give the nākhudā</li>
<li>Bashīr his letter, and ʿImrān and Saʿīd their letters.</li>
<li>The letters for the people of Mangalore ⟦when Sheikh</li>
<li>Abraham b. Yishū arrives . . . him {read: soothe him with kind words}⟧\\take delivery of them and take good care// for me of the letters for the people in</li>
<li>Mangalore, since there are many matters {alt. tr.: I have many orders} in all of them</li>
<li>that have to be attended to {alt. tr.: so take good care of them}. Hand over to every one his letter</li>
<li>personally. By God! Take good care of all the letters {alt. tr.: Take this matter seriously}! And peace.</li>
<li>Especially in the letter to the nākhudā ʿAlī al-Fawfalī</li>
<li>I have many orders, and likewise (in the letters to) the Bānyāns of</li>
<li>Mangalore. I have empowered the nākhudā ʿAlī al-Fawfalī</li>
<li>to sell the goods packed and all the items {alt. tr.: their gear}</li>
<li>and to take possession of the shallow dish kept by Budah,</li>
<li>the son of Slslyty, which had been left with him</li>
<li>by Abū Saʿīd, and to take possession of the large copper kettle</li>
<li>for cooking dates which</li>
<li>Bnk Syty has, and to get the sandarac</li>
<li>and all the {add: retail} items which are in the storeroom;</li>
<li>he is empowered to take possession of everything which belongs to me there.</li>
<li>Please help him in this, and, by God, take care of</li>
<li>the letters&mdash;all of them! And peace. &nbsp;</li>
