41/8  dinars. And also, in the ship of the nākhudāAbu ’l-Ḥasan,
a piece of lead; the weight: two hundred and sixty pounds; the price:
171/3 dinars; the export tax from the Furḍa, 1/3  d.; (Bama)
has one dinar for buying water and cabin equipment. Your total
debt: 653 dinars. Balance in your favor:
32 dinars. {Add: Your debit:} Sent to you with Abu ’l-Khayr,
32 dinars. I have sent to you with Sheikh Abu
’l-Khayr and Bama a gift from me to you: 10 (?) rubāʿiyyas of
sugar and raisins, as well as a dast of white paper. As for the paper, for two years now
it has been impossible to get any (in the market), and I have given you this from (the stock)
I keep for myself.  I have sent you a piece (made) of corals for your son Surūr
and a quarter {add: mikyāl} of seeds. Please be sure to take delivery of all this.
Together with my letter, a letter from Makhlūf ‘The Orphan’was dispatched to you,
which he had sent from ʿAydhāb. I have more than twenty of his
letters, all of them worthless {alt. tr. utterly confused}—he is an old man in his dotage, and has become senile
in his old age {alt. tr.: utterly confused at the end of his life} and doesn’t know what he is doing. As for the documents,
which I had made out in Muslim and Jewish (courts), wherein he releases
you from any claim, demand, responsibility or oath, they are in my
safekeeping and are certified by reliable witnesses.
You mentioned the betel nuts, which you had sent to me with
Sheikh ʿAbd al-Malik last year, and the two boards (of teak wood),  I took delivery of
this and sent you last year in exchange, with Saydān,
sugar, raisins, and other {add: retail} items, but God ordained what He ordained. As for the remaining
boards, Sheikh Joseph and Sheikh Khalaf  took delivery (of them)—they were
owed them from the year (before). As for the drky, none has come this year
at all. And I was not able to get any indigo. Concerning what you mentioned about
Musallam al-Kaʿkī,  he has not sent you a thing this year, nor have I
seen a letter of his. Please accept for yourself and your son the best of greetings from me,
and convey my best regards to the illustrious nākhudā ʿAlī al- Fawfalī.
And peace! Know, my lord, that in the ship of the nākhudā
Rāmisht and in the ship of his two sons and two brothers-in-law {alt. tr.: and in the ship of his son and (the ship) of his son-in-law},  and in the ship of
the nākhudā Abu ’l-Ḥasan b. Abu ’l-Katāʿib, four ships . . .



In each ship there is a bundle of letters for you and for Abraham


b. ⟦Yishū⟧ //Fayyūmī//,  for all the Bānyāns of Mangalore, for the nākhudā


al-Fawfalī, and for ʿImrān and Saʿīd. Please be sure to take delivery of 


them all and take good care of them. Give the nākhudā 


Bashīr his letter, and ʿImrān and Saʿīd their letters. 


The letters for the people of Mangalore ⟦when Sheikh 


Abraham b. Yishū arrives . . . him {read: soothe him with kind words}⟧//take delivery of them and take good care// for me of the letters for the people in 


Mangalore, since there are many matters {alt. tr.: I have many orders} in all of them


that have to be attended to {alt. tr.: so take good care of them}. Hand over to every one his letter


personally. By God! Take good care of all the letters {alt. tr.: Take this matter seriously}! And peace.


Especially in the letter to the nākhudā ʿAlī al-Fawfalī 


I have many orders, and likewise (in the letters to) the Bānyāns of


Mangalore. I have empowered the nākhudā ʿAlī al-Fawfalī 


to sell the goods packed and all the items {alt. tr.: their gear} 


and to take possession of the shallow dish kept by Budah,


the son of Slslyty, which had been left with him 


by Abū Saʿīd, and to take possession of the large copper kettle 


for cooking dates which 


Bnk Syty has, and to get the sandarac 


and all the {add: retail} items which are in the storeroom;


he is empowered to take possession of everything which belongs to me there. 


Please help him in this, and, by God, take care of


the letters—all of them! And peace.
