<li>In Your name, O Merciful. </li>
<li>For the Lord will be your trust; He will keep your feet from being caught. The Lord </li>
<li>is your guardian, the Lord is your protection at your right hand. The Lord will guard you </li>
<li>from all harm; He will guard your life. He will guard your going </li>
<li>and your coming now and forever. By day the sun will not </li>
<li>strike you, nor the moon by night. Those who love Your teaching enjoy well-being; </li>
<li>they encounter no adversity. To my esteemed lord, the light of my eyes and the ornament </li>
<li>on my neck, my master and lord Abraham, the son of his honor, great and holy master Peraḥyā Ben Yijū—may he rest in Eden! </li>
<li>My lord, there arrived the small shipment of pepper, namely one and a quarter bahār </li>
<li>less four pounds of big measure. I, your servant, went to take</li>
<li>delivery and received the whole due. Likewise, Sheikh Khalaf received</li>
<li>his shipment. You mentioned, my lord, that this</li>
<li>bahār and a quarter less four pounds of pepper was (sent against) the balance of my, your servant’s, entire account</li>
<li>from the cardamom and the ‘eggs,’ etc. May God reward</li>
<li>and care for you well {alt. tr.: undertake to provide you with a good reward}, and may I never miss your favors!</li>
<li>You, my lord, asked about your brother Mevassēr. He has not come during</li>
<li>this entire period, nor have I seen a letter for you</li>
<li>from Egypt. Had I gotten a letter for you, my lord,</li>
<li>I, your servant, would have forwarded it to you. You, my lord, (certainly) have</li>
<li>heard the news from Egypt from the merchants who arrived,</li>
<li>God willing, at your place. I send your eminent excellency the best</li>
<li>profuse greetings, and to all those in your protective care</li>
<li>the choicest, profuse greetings. And much peace. Salvation is near! </li>
</ol>

<li>his honor, great and holy master and lord Rabbi Peraḥyā Ben Yijū—may his rest be honored! </li>
<li>(From) he that experiences your favors daily, </li>
<li>Joseph b. Abraham—may he rest in Eden! </li>
