In Your name, O Merciful. 
For the Lord will be your trust; He will keep your feet from being caught. The Lord 
is your guardian, the Lord is your protection at your right hand. The Lord will guard you 
from all harm; He will guard your life. He will guard your going 
and your coming now and forever. By day the sun will not 
strike you, nor the moon by night. Those who love Your teaching enjoy well-being; 
they encounter no adversity. To my esteemed lord, the light of my eyes and the ornament 
on my neck, my master and lord Abraham, the son of his honor, great and holy master Peraḥyā Ben Yijū—may he rest in Eden! 
My lord, there arrived the small shipment of pepper, namely one and a quarter bahār 
less four pounds of big measure. I, your servant, went to take
delivery and received the whole due. Likewise, Sheikh Khalaf received
his shipment. You mentioned, my lord, that this
bahār and a quarter less four pounds of pepper was (sent against) the balance of my, your servant’s, entire account
from the cardamom and the ‘eggs,’ etc. May God reward
and care for you well {alt. tr.: undertake to provide you with a good reward}, and may I never miss your favors!
You, my lord, asked about your brother Mevassēr. He has not come during
this entire period, nor have I seen a letter for you
from Egypt. Had I gotten a letter for you, my lord,
I, your servant, would have forwarded it to you. You, my lord, (certainly) have
heard the news from Egypt from the merchants who arrived,
God willing, at your place. I send your eminent excellency the best
profuse greetings, and to all those in your protective care
the choicest, profuse greetings. And much peace. Salvation is near!

To his honor, great and holy master and lord Abraham, son of 
his honor, great and holy master and lord Rabbi Peraḥyā Ben Yijū—may his rest be honored! 
(From) he that experiences your favors daily, 
Joseph b. Abraham—may he rest in Eden!
