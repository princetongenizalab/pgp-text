Al-Fawfalī has not arrived. 
The Kūfī iron, wh[ich was sent in] the ship of
Ibn al-Muqaddam; the ship [foundered] off the coast of Abyan [. . .]
The pepper and a part of the ir[on] was lost. [The iron] which [was salvaged]
is being detained in the Furḍa [. . .] and I do not know how much we will realize
from it, if anything at all [. . .]. You, my master, mentioned [. . .] that my share in it was 
one and a quarter bahārs [. . .]
will be salvaged, God willing. Let’s wait for what will arrive from it. This will be only after the sailing of the ships.
Whatever will be realized, is profit, for it is better [. . .]
Should there be anything {add: more} realized from the kārdāl, kindly send it. Please make an effort
in this matter. Likewise in the matter of the ‘eggs,’ whatever will be realized [. . .], God willing.
There was already sent to you, my master, in the ship of Sheikh Maḍmūn with the nākhudā
Maḥrūz—may God ordain his safe arrival!—what has no importance, namely a maqṭaʿ for
your boy and a dast of 12 sheets of Ṭalḥī paper, a bottle of wine,
a rubāʿiyya of soap and a rubāʿiyya of almonds. Please accept all of this.
The maqṭaʿ and the paper are wrapped in a piece of cloth, on which is your name. Likewise on
every item is your name [. . .] [Would] you, my lord, [send me] 

recto, right margin

this year some
profitable purchase, as you have
kindly accustomed me to? However, the pepper
this year was cheap and did not return
the capital. It is better not to risk one’s
possessions and go bankrupt {alt. tr.: . . . this year has sold poorly and does not guarantee the capital better than a risky investment on which one loses all}. Please accept, my master,
the best, profuse greetings for your esteemed self. And Peace.
There arrived a letter from your brother
and I am forwarding it to you with this letter.
And Peace. 
I beg to inform you, my master, that the ship
had sailed and could not be seen for some days. Then it came back
safe, thank God.
The aforementioned goods were forwarded to you,
except the almonds, for they were spoiled. I tried to get
others for you; but none arrived in town before the departure
of the people. The iron has arrived.
I took 123 pounds
and Sheikh Khalaf his share,
while Sheikh Maḍmūn took the rest for you. 

verso

Likewise, a little of the iron that was salvaged for us from the ship-wreck. Al-Fawfalī
absconded to Zabīd. When {alt. tr.: If} he arrives at your place, take from him for me the ‘eggs’ or their proceeds.
Likewise, you mentioned that the kārdāl did not deliver to you anything. And
you did not deliver to me goods purchased from him for six mithqāls. You know, my lord, 
that you paid the kardāl (!) at your own initiative. Now, if you, my lord, send something, fine. However,
I leave the decision entirely to you {alt. tr.: if not—your opinion is more worthy}. And Peace.

verso, address

(To) His excellency, the most illustrious sheikh [my master and lord] Abraham, son of his honor, great and holy 
master Peraḥyā the scribe b. Yijū—may God make his honored position permanent! 
(From) His servant, who is grateful for his favors 
Joseph b. Abraham—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest!
