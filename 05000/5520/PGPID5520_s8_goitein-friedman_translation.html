<li>Al-Fawfalī has not arrived. </li>
<li>The Kūfī iron, wh[ich was sent in] the ship of</li>
<li>Ibn al-Muqaddam; the ship [foundered] off the coast of Abyan [. . .]</li>
<li>The pepper and a part of the ir[on] was lost. [The iron] which [was salvaged]</li>
<li>is being detained in the Furḍa [. . .] and I do not know how much we will realize</li>
<li>from it, if anything at all [. . .]. You, my master, mentioned [. . .] that my share in it was </li>
<li>one and a quarter bahārs [. . .]</li>
<li>will be salvaged, God willing. Let’s wait for what will arrive from it. This will be only after the sailing of the ships.</li>
<li>Whatever will be realized, is profit, for it is better [. . .]</li>
<li>Should there be anything {add: more} realized from the kārdāl, kindly send it. Please make an effort</li>
<li>in this matter. Likewise in the matter of the ‘eggs,’ whatever will be realized [. . .], God willing.</li>
<li>There was already sent to you, my master, in the ship of Sheikh Maḍmūn with the nākhudā</li>
<li>Maḥrūz—may God ordain his safe arrival!—what has no importance, namely a maqṭaʿ for</li>
<li>your boy and a dast of 12 sheets of Ṭalḥī paper, a bottle of wine,</li>
<li>a rubāʿiyya of soap and a rubāʿiyya of almonds. Please accept all of this.</li>
<li>The maqṭaʿ and the paper are wrapped in a piece of cloth, on which is your name. Likewise on</li>
<li>every item is your name [. . .] [Would] you, my lord, [send me] </li>
</ol>

<li>this year some</li>
<li>profitable purchase, as you have</li>
<li>kindly accustomed me to? However, the pepper</li>
<li>this year was cheap and did not return</li>
<li>the capital. It is better not to risk one’s</li>
<li>possessions and go bankrupt {alt. tr.: . . . this year has sold poorly and does not guarantee the capital better than a risky investment on which one loses all}. Please accept, my master,</li>
<li>the best, profuse greetings for your esteemed self. And Peace.</li>
<li>There arrived a letter from your brother</li>
<li>and I am forwarding it to you with this letter.</li>
<li>And Peace. </li>
<li>I beg to inform you, my master, that the ship</li>
<li>had sailed and could not be seen for some days. Then it came back</li>
<li>safe, thank God.</li>
<li>The aforementioned goods were forwarded to you,</li>
<li>except the almonds, for they were spoiled. I tried to get</li>
<li>others for you; but none arrived in town before the departure</li>
<li>of the people. The iron has arrived.</li>
<li>I took 123 pounds</li>
<li>and Sheikh Khalaf his share,</li>
<li>while Sheikh Maḍmūn took the rest for you. </li>

<li>Likewise, a little of the iron that was salvaged for us from the ship-wreck. Al-Fawfalī</li>
<li>absconded to Zabīd. When {alt. tr.: If} he arrives at your place, take from him for me the ‘eggs’ or their proceeds.</li>
<li>Likewise, you mentioned that the kārdāl did not deliver to you anything. And</li>
<li>you did not deliver to me goods purchased from him for six mithqāls. You know, my lord, </li>
<li>that you paid the kardāl (!) at your own initiative. Now, if you, my lord, send something, fine. However,</li>
<li>I leave the decision entirely to you {alt. tr.: if not—your opinion is more worthy}. And Peace.</li>

<li>(To) His excellency, the most illustrious sheikh [my master and lord] Abraham, son of his honor, great and holy </li>
<li>master Peraḥyā the scribe b. Yijū—may God make his honored position permanent! </li>
<li>(From) His servant, who is grateful for his favors </li>
<li>Joseph b. Abraham—may the spirit of the Lord give him rest! </li>
