                        <h3>recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>...] in His mercy. I noted that you mentioned</li>
<li>in your esteemed letter</li>
<li>that you had sent some pepper in the ship of the nākhudā Rāmisht</li>
<li>—twelve bahārs of small measure. This has arrived </li>
<li>and (I) your servant went to collect it. From this is to be deducted</li>
<li>—as you mention in your letter—forty</li>
<li>-five pounds, leaving you eleven</li>
<li>bahārs and two hundred and fifty-five pounds, the price being</li>
<li>34 dinars (per bahār). The (total) value:</li>
<li>403 dinars, minus one-sixth.</li>
<li>From this (sum) is to be deducted the ‘tithe,’ 82 ¼ </li>
<li>dinars; the cost for taking delivery of the goods, 4 ⅙ dinars;</li>
<li>the cost of baskets of palm leaves and a porter, one and one-quarter and one-sixth dinars;</li>
<li>a total of 88 dinars minus one-sixth,</li>
<li>leaving 315 dinars (in your favor).</li>
<li>You mentioned that you sent in the ship of the nākhudā</li>
<li>Abu ʾl-Ḥasan b. Abu ʾl-Katāʾib some refurbished</li>
<li>iron—twenty-one bahārs. But</li>
<li>the nākhudā Abū ʿAbd Allah, his son, gave me only</li>
<li>seventeen bahārs of large measure; he stated that</li>
<li>the Bānyān (the Indian merchant), whom you asked to take charge of {alt. tr.: to whom you referred him for collection of} the iron,</li>
<li>had delivered no more than this to him, saying that the rest of</li>
<li>the iron was in the highlands and had not yet arrived. In reply, I held him (Abū ʿAbd Allah) to be under obligation {alt. tr.: I bound him by a stipulation},</li>
<li>if this were not true,</li>
<li>to pay the price (of it), according to the sale value in Aden.</li>
<li>He is to pay this to you, my lord, in India.</li>
<li>The iron I received from you in Aden is twenty</li>
<li>bahārs and one hundred and twenty pounds of small measure.</li>
<li>From this is to be deducted: for the elder Joseph b.</li>
<li>Abraham, three bahārs and one hundred and eighty</li>
<li>pounds; for Khalaf b. Isḥāq, two bahārs</li>
<li>and one-quarter—a total of five bahārs and two hundred</li>
<li>and fifty-five pounds, leaving you four-</li>
<li>teen bahārs and one hundred and sixty-five pounds,</li>
<li>the price being 17 dinars (per bahār). The (total) value:</li>
<li>247 ¼ dinars. From this is to be deducted</li>
<li>the ‘tithe,’ the expenses {alt. tr.: toll}, and the (cost of) the porter,</li>
<li>27 ¼ dinars, leaving 220</li>
<li>dinars. Therefore, the sum total owed you is (approximately)</li>
<li>535 dinars. I (your servant) bought you</li>
<li>three bags of copper, weighing</li>
<li>five bahārs, at a cost of 83 (dinars per bahār).</li>
<li>The (total) value: 415 dinars.</li>
<li>The number of pieces in each bag is twenty-three. </li>
<li>The cost of hides and packing: 1 ½ dinars. Exit tolls</li>
<li>from the Furḍa, 4 ⅛ dinars. I sent you</li>
<li>this in the ship of the nākhudā Rāmisht,</li>
<li>one bag; in the ship of al-Muqaddam, one bag; and in the ship of</li>
<li>Nambiyar (ani?) {Read: Nmby Rwy}, one bag—a total of three bags. Freight charges for </li>
<li>this (were) 4 ½ dinars. (Also) charged to you, the registration fee from {alt. tr.: of} the </li>
<li>ship’s captain for the pepper and the iron, two dinars.</li>

<li>...</li>
<li>The letter of my lord, the most illustrious elder, has arrived&mdash;may God make permanent&nbsp;</li>
<li>your well-being, may He guard your life and humble those who envy you! It was</li>
<li>a most gladdening letter and a most delightful message. I was happy to learn of your well-being</li>
<li>and your prosperous circumstances, and I have entreated God (to grant you) more of every good thing [...</li>

                        <h3>verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Also, there are charged to you copper bars, twenty-five</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pounds, twenty-eight pieces in number,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>worth eight dinars; a basket of dates,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one hundred and fifteen pounds, worth 2 ¾ dinars;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the cost of an Abyssinian hide, two dinars; the price of ten</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Berbera mats, which are in a package</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>marked in Hebrew and Arabic, one dinar;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a zodiac carpet, worth five dinars, a maqṭaʿ cloth,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and two Manārī kerchiefs {alt. tr.: fūṭas}, worth six dinars—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all this with Abū Ghālib, the ship’s captain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He also has with him a piece of lead, weighing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two hundred and forty-five pounds, worth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28 ½ dinars and two qīrāṭs, the price (per bahār) being 35 dinars;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>freight charges for the piece of lead, one dinar. Abū</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ghālib, the ship’s captain, has with him also a purse, in which there are 20 Egyptian mithqāls,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>worth 47 dinars (Malikī).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That purse contains (also) seven Malikī dinars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total sum: 535 ⅓ dinars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This settles my lord’s account. There also arrived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ‘eggs,’ which you sent in the ship of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ibn Abu ʾl-Katāʾib, and this was received by the elders Joseph</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Khalaf, according to the distribution which you indicated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in your letter. The betel nuts, which</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you sent to your servant, also arrived, and this is on {alt. tr.: against} the balance of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my account with your excellency {alt. tr.: which you owed me} from last</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>year. But the betel nuts were extremely mediocre, both the white</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the red ones. There also arrived what you were kind enough (to send), namely four </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>locks and two qaṣʿa-bowls. Your servant has sent to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with Abū Ghālib, the ship’s captain, two large brazilwood boxes with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sugar, and two brazilwood boxes with raisins, and a package with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three dasts of Egyptian Ṭalḥī paper of the best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>obtainable quality. Please accept this, my lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and may you think well of me! If you have any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>need or service (to be done), I would be happy {lit., ‘give me the pleasure’} to take care of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May you have abundant well-being! And peace.</p>
</li>
</ol>
