<p>The letter of my lord, the most illustrious elder, arrived; I read&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>recto (IB II, 14)</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>and understood it, and I was happy to learn that you were well [II,13.5: and your affairs]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in order, for which I thanked God very much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and asked Him to give you more of every good thing. May God unite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>us under the most joyful circumstances, and in the best of </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spirits, for he controls this and is able to accomplish it,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God willing! From what you mentioned,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord, I learned that you had sent the two locks and the two thousand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>white and red betel nuts. I have already</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>received this, and I thank you for attending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to it. I have sent you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with ʿAbd al-Masīḥ, the deacon, a bundle of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Berbera mats, six in number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wrapped them in canvas and your name is written</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on it in Arabic and Hebrew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With him, I have also sent you (a gift) from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me: a new, first-rate, raw Dabīqī scarf,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which has a pretty band on each side</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and is fit to be worn by prominent men. Also (sent) with him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are two dasts of fine, large paper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>government paper, the like of which</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no one has. In addition, (I sent) with him two rubāʿiyyas of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sugar and raisins. See that you receive from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all this. Everything you had sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Abu ʾl-Khayr has arrived, and he has taken delivery of all of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He bought Egyptian linen and went up into the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>highlands. He requested me to ask you to look after his interests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by sending his remaining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iron and cardamom and the entire balance to his credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Send him all this on the first boat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which sails from India. As for iron, this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>year it sold (well) in Aden—all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kinds of iron— and in the coming year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there will also be a good market, because</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is none at all left in the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please take notice of this. Please accept for yourself best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wishes, and for your son Surūr and for Bama,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most profuse greetings. And peace.</p>

<li>
<p>Please give Sūs Sītī and Kinbātī {read: Kinābtī} ⟦and Isḥā…⟧</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Isḥāq the Bānyān my best regards, and tell them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of my longing for them. Inform them in my name that as for pepper, in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this coming year its value, (that is) the price per bahār, will be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 dinars, and more, and as for refurbished iron,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bahār will be (worth) not less than 20 dinars,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and that the (supply of ) raqṣ (shining, glittering iron), which was in the city, is completely exhausted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if they can they should dispatch a ship from Mangalore,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and send in it any available pepper, iron,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cubeb, and ginger; it should set out at the first opportunity {alt. tr.: at the beginning of the season} for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Dyyb (Diū) {alt. tr.: Maldives} taking {alt. tr.: to take} some coir (coconut fiber), fine aloes wood,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mango (?), and coconuts, because all these are selling well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they are equipping a ship in Aden, and they want me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to take part, I will share (in it) with them. If there were</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a ship sailing for Mangalore this year, I would send them {alt. tr.: Had there been a ship…I would have sent them}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gold, sugar, raisins and (other) goods. Be sure to inform them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of all this, and do not be remiss, for you take the place of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a letter of mine to them. And peace.</p>
