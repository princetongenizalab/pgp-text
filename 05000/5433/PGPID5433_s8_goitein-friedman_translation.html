<li>a promissory note in exchange for that one (that he had delivered), with witnesses and the account of the facts, that is, (attesting) that he had delivered</li>
<li>the promissory note and the release (=receipt) to the person who had paid the gold, as is written</li>
<li>in the promissory notes, let him draw up a promissory note and have (witnesses) testify </li>
<li>to that effect. And it is not such a large sum that one might be concerned</li>
<li>here for such a serious matter. Furthermore, if</li>
<li>Sheikh Abu ʾl-Surūr should be present (in Old Cairo) and (you) my lord (are willing to) be surety in my stead to Sheikh Ḍāfir</li>
<li>in the matter of payment of the sum that he still owes, please be surety in my stead</li>
<li>and at my expense for responsibility for any- thing that might happen to him (to Ḍāfir)</li>

<li>the aforementioned sum that he owes and deliver it to</li>

<li>Please be so kind as to act as my (your servant’s) representative against Ḍāfir b. Burayk of Alexandria</li>
<li>and collect from him fifty-five and a half Egyptian mithqāls,</li>
<li>for the principal that Ḍāfir owed was one hundred and fifty</li>
<li>mithqāls, which he had received from Barakāt b. Mukhtār, servant of</li>
<li>the Rayyis. Now Ḍāfir claimed that the deceased, my brother Bundār—may he find mercy!—</li>
<li>told him to pay from that sum to a certain merchant 92</li>
<li>mithqāls. So says Ḍāfir. And Ḍāfir further claimed</li>
<li>that he is owed for Muḥammad the weigher two and a half mithqāls. The total to his credit is 94 ½.</li>
<li>Ḍāfir’s remaining debt is 55 ½ mithqāls. Please be so kind, my lord, as</li>
<li>to act as my (your servant’s) representative to receive this (sum) and to be surety to him (to Ḍāfir)</li>
<li>for the responsibility of {alt. tr.: after} delivering this (sum) to you. This Ḍāfir’s only excuse</li>
<li>concerning delivery of this gold is that he says</li>
<li>that there is against him a wr[itten] promissory note [with] witnesses who attested</li>
<li>that he had received it. And the promissory note is in the hands of Sheikh Abu ʾl-Surūr </li>
<li>Faraḥ b. Yeshūʿā ha-Kohen. So if Sheikh Abu ʾl-Surūr should happen to be</li>
<li>in Fustat, please, my lord, be so kind as to take the promissory note from him</li>
<li>and deliver it to Ḍāfir, so that he pay the gold, and thereby</li>
<li>the claim against him {alt. tr.: his claim} will be annulled. And if Sheikh Abu ʾl-Surūr should demand that there be drawn up for him </li>

<li>And a shipment to Maḥrūz b. Yaʿqūb, of Aden, from his mother:</li>
<li>A satchel containing aromatic wood and a satchel containing a kerchief made of</li>
<li>lālas silk and two letters, one to him and the other to his sister,</li>
<li>the wife of Abū Zikrī ha-Kohen. And on the aromatic wood and the kerchief is</li>
<li>written the name ‘Maḥrūz b. Yaʿqūb.’</li>
<li>These two things should be delivered to him, when God the Exalted, Sublime and Glorified brings you there in safety.</li>
