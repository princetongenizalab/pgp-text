                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In Your name, O Merciful. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letter of your excellency the illustrious Sheikh, has arrived—[may God prolong your life/]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and make permanent your honored position, and rank/highness and loftiness/ex[cellence, and ascendancy!/]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May He never deprive your dwelling-place and court of any good!/[May He bestow]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>upon you that which is most suitable of all He usually confers {alt. tr.: [May He protect] for your sake… of all He has conferred upon you]}!/May He subdue those that are envious of you and crush your enemies/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and may all your affairs be completed successfully {lit., ‘...be joined by blessings’}! I was glad when I looked at your letter even before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had taken notice of its content. Then I read it full of happiness and, while studying it, became joyous and cheerful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For it was reassuring for me to learn from it about your well-being and your satisfactory state. Then I praised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God for this very much and asked Him to give you more of all the best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in His mercy. Whatever longing (for me) you expressed, my lord, I,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your servant, feel twice as strongly (for you) and more than what you have described in writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God decree {read: facilitate} our coming together in the near future in complete happiness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>through His mercy, God willing! I took notice,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my master, of your detailed statement concerning sending ‘refurbished’ iron in the boat of the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nākhudā Ibn Abu ʾl-Katāʾib. It (the shipment) has arrived, and I received from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two bahārs and one third, as you noted, my lord. The nākhudā </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joseph arrived from Dahbattan on the Malabar Coast in the ship of Ibn al-Muqaddam, and I received from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two basins, two ewers and two basins for candlesticks. Likewise, I took delivery from my lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the most illustrious Sheikh Maḍmūn, of 30 pounds of cardamom from your excellency’s bag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and paid for it the customs duties, as you had written. Please send the remaining lids, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord. However, of the betel nuts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentioned by you, my lord, I, your servant, have not received anything, for you wrote that you had sent them with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jawhar, the slave-agent of Ḍāfir, but he has not arrived this year. As to your shipment, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my master, forwarded from Fandarayna in the ship of Fatan Swamī through Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu ʾl-Ḥasan b. Jaʿfar. The smaller ship arrived and I took delivery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from it {alt. tr.: from him} of 1 ⅜ bahār of pepper, as had been stated in your memorandum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to my master, the most illustrious Sheikh Maḍmūn, as well as of a bahār of amlas (‘smooth’) iron.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The larger ship, however, arrived near Berbera, when its captain ran into trouble with it, until</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it was thrust against Bāb al-Mandab, where it foundered {alt. tr.: it crashed at… and broke up there}.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pepper was a total loss. God salvaged none of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to the iron, mariners were brought from Aden, with whom it was stipulated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that they would dive for it and salvage it. They salvaged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about one half of the iron, and, while I am writing this letter,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are bringing it out of the Furḍa to {alt. tr: releasing all of it from the… and bringing it to} the storehouse of the most illustrious Sheikh,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my master Maḍmūn b. al-Ḥasan. All the expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incurred for the diving and for transport will be deducted from whatever will be {alt. tr.: was deducted from whatever was} realized for it (that iron), and the rest will be divided proportionally,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each taking his proper share. I regret very much your losses. But the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy one, blessed be He will compensate you and me presently {alt. tr.: may . . . compen sate… speedily}. As to the (household) goods ordered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by you, my master: You asked me to buy a frying pan of stone in a {lit., ‘and its’} case. Later on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its case broke {alt. tr.:...pan of stone, and I wrapped it and after I wrapped it, it broke}, whereupon I bought you an iron frying pan for a niṣāfī,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which is, after all, better than a stone pan {lit., ‘more recommended than the stone one’}. I bought you (also) for a niṣāfī, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>glassware: tumblers, bowls {alt. tr.: jugs/cups} and cups {alt. tr.: jars}, namely sixty-eight </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tumblers, ten bowls and five cups {alt. tr.: jars}; with the basket, which cost a qīrāṭ, it made exactly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one niṣāfī; furthermore, five green bottles with {lit., ‘in’} their baskets for eleven qīrāṭ, the </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>total being a dinar and eleven qīrāṭs. As to the small pots, I</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>could not get any single items, only in dasts. The wheat has been made ready for dispatch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to {lit., ‘has been packed for’} you by my lord, the most illustrious Sheikh Maḍmūn. I, your servant, sent to [you] on my</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>account five manns of good silk, for I saw that my master, the most illustrious Sheikh </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maḍmūn, had sent some to Ibn ʿAdlān and to others and it was reported in his (Ibn ʿAdlān’s) name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that it is selling well in Malabar. Therefore, I thought it was preferable to send, instead of gold,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>merchandise, which might bring some profit. Thus, kindly sell it for me, your servant,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for whatever price God, the Exalted, apportions as livelihood, and buy for me, your servant, whatever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God, the Exalted, apportions and send it to me in any ship, without any liability, my lord, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for any perils on land or sea. If the commodities purchased include</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>betel nut or cardamom, kindly purchase for whatever price is available; but you, my master,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>need no instructions, for you are competent {alt. tr.: the epitome of competence}. Indeed, I, your servant, cause you trouble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>every year; but you, my master, do [excuse] your servant,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as it has always been your habit, in the past and recently. Moreover, {add: I inform you} my master,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>last year, I sent to the captain Masʿūd, the Abyssinian,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 Egyptian mithqāls, with which to buy whatever God, the Exalted, would apportion. When, however,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he arrived at your place, the well-known misfortune {lit., ‘that misfortune’} befell him. He {lit., ‘the man’} informed me that he</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had bought me two bahārs of pepper, which he carried with him, and that there remained for me 17 ¼ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mithqāls, which were deposited with my master, the most illustrious Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu ʾl-Ḥasan ʿAlī b. Jaʿfar. Therefore, I, the captain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masʿūd, and Bakhtiyār, the slave-agent of ʿAlī b. Jaʿfar, went to the most illustrious Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ʿAlī b. Muḥammad al-Nīlī, and he (Masʿūd) reported to him the matter, whereupon I received</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a notification from al-Nīlī {alt. tr.: took a note/letter, which al-Nīlī wrote} to ʿAlī b. Jaʿfar about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you meet him, kindly greet him in my name and ask him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to buy for me with this whatever God, the Exalted, apportions and to send it in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any ship without any liability for any risk on sea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or land, in this world or in the world to come. I do not need giving you instructions, how to approach {lit., ‘to speak to’}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>him; “a hint is sufficient for a wise man.” May my lord receive for his esteemed self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the best greetings and convey the best and most profuse greetings in my name to my master, the noble scion, and all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whom your care embraces and Bama! And Peace.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I, your servant, sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what has no importance or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>value, namely a bottle of sugar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a good Abyssinian hide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the hide, is written</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Yiju’ from outside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and from inside on various places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Favor me by accepting and excuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me, as had been your habit,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the past and recently.</p>

<p>and the bottle of sugar are with Sheikh Abu ʾl-Ḥasan al-Maḥallī, and</p>

<p>the silk is with the elder Abū ʿAlī b. Ṭayyib. Please, my lord, take delivery</p>
