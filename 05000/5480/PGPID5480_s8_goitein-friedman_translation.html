<p>On Monday, 12 Nisan [...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Fustat Egypt, situated on the Nile river, [in the jurisdiction of our lord Abraham . . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the strong hammer, the western lamp, banner of the rabbis, unique [of his generation . . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There appeared before us, we the undersigned, our master and lord Eleazar the [distinguished ] elder [b. . . . and master and lord ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Josiah the distinguished elder b. our master and lord Japheth—may his memory by a blessing!—the agents, whom [were appointed . . . and made]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>agents to accept payment of the money left by our master and lord Petaḥ[yā...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He left a minor orphan //whose name is Abu ʾl-Ḥasan// who has the right to his inheritance according [to the Torah . . . and . . . appointed]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>them in the port city of Alexandria. They said to us: Perform with us the symbolic act of obligation and testify [to us...one to]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>another (?), and we collected and took payment from the Qadi al-Sadīd ʿAlī b. Maḥmūd known as Ibn al-Muḥtasib—may his honored position be permanent!—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good, verified, weighed Egyptian gold coinage, 173 724 dinars,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Egyptian gold coins, good, confirmed, weighed, Egyptian standard mithqāls, which had been sent with him to carry as a trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by our lord the most illustrious Sheikh, his honor, great and holy master and lord Shemaryāhū, the distinguished prince (sar), the important Nagid, the Nagid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the land of Yemen, who is good before God and trusted by men, which had been deposited with him for the heirs of our master Petaḥyā, mentioned above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He proceeded to send them (the funds) to them, intending that a quittance from the responsibility be issued him, for today and the future. Now perform with us the symbolic act of obligation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and testify to us, that each of us has released our master and lord Shemaryāhū the distinguished prince mentioned above and his heirs after him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from responsibility for thus sum, which we have received from the aforementioned Qadi ʿAlī—a complete, final, ultimate release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing will discredit it, no condition will invalidate it, and no interpretation will nullify it, a release for payment and full collection, as we were entrusted to do by [. . .]}</p>
