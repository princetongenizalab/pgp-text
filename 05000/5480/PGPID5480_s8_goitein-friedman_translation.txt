On Monday, 12 Nisan [...]


in Fustat Egypt, situated on the Nile river, [in the jurisdiction of our lord Abraham . . .]


the strong hammer, the western lamp, banner of the rabbis, unique [of his generation . . .]


There appeared before us, we the undersigned, our master and lord Eleazar the [distinguished ] elder [b. . . . and master and lord ]


Josiah the distinguished elder b. our master and lord Japheth—may his memory by a blessing!—the agents, whom [were appointed . . . and made]


agents to accept payment of the money left by our master and lord Petaḥ[yā...]


He left a minor orphan //whose name is Abu ʾl-Ḥasan// who has the right to his inheritance according [to the Torah . . . and . . . appointed]


them in the port city of Alexandria. They said to us: Perform with us the symbolic act of obligation and testify [to us...one to]


another (?), and we collected and took payment from the Qadi al-Sadīd ʿAlī b. Maḥmūd known as Ibn al-Muḥtasib—may his honored position be permanent!—


good, verified, weighed Egyptian gold coinage, 173 724 dinars,


Egyptian gold coins, good, confirmed, weighed, Egyptian standard mithqāls, which had been sent with him to carry as a trust


by our lord the most illustrious Sheikh, his honor, great and holy master and lord Shemaryāhū, the distinguished prince (sar), the important Nagid, the Nagid


of the land of Yemen, who is good before God and trusted by men, which had been deposited with him for the heirs of our master Petaḥyā, mentioned above.


He proceeded to send them (the funds) to them, intending that a quittance from the responsibility be issued him, for today and the future. Now perform with us the symbolic act of obligation


and testify to us, that each of us has released our master and lord Shemaryāhū the distinguished prince mentioned above and his heirs after him


from responsibility for thus sum, which we have received from the aforementioned Qadi ʿAlī—a complete, final, ultimate release.


Nothing will discredit it, no condition will invalidate it, and no interpretation will nullify it, a release for payment and full collection, as we were entrusted to do by [. . .]}
