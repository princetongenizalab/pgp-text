<li>[. . .] </li>
<li>[. . .] </li>
<li>[. . .] that you had a document or </li>
<li>[. . .]</li>
<li>[. . .] they did not say, we (are acting) in accordance with our father’s will and demanding {alt. tr.: [This is] what they said: in accordance with our father’s will, we demand} our right, [and indeed they did not]</li>
<li>produce a handwritten statement testifying to what was [due] them, nor a document with witnesses, and they did not have a w[ill]</li>
<li>proper, as wills should be. And it came to pass, when we saw all that was written in your letter</li>
<li>and read it to them [and h]eard all their words, we were amazed and much distressed, </li>
<li>and we said, How has such evil been don[e], to spread slander [and] idle, evil words</li>
<li>and abuse with their li[ ps] one who is appointed by the exilarchs and the heads of</li>
<li>the yeshivas over all of Israel and invested with the trust of the rulers who are overseas</li>
<li>and those who are in the desert. It is hereby our opinion and we state, in truth, that these men</li>
<li>must be fined, each and every one of them, a fine to be paid to our lord Maḍmūn, Prince of</li>
<li>the Congregations, because he is a distinguished person. The penalty imposed for embarrassing another depends entirely on the offender and the person affronted, and everything</li>
<li>is defined in terms of his dignity, taking the most stringent view. Since our sages have said that for distinguished persons one increases the limits of compensation for humiliation.</li>
<li>And this is what they said—may their memory be for a blessing! ‘A certain person insulted R. Judah b. Han̄in̄a; the case was brought before</li>
<li>R. Simeon b. Lakish, and he fined him a pound of gold.’ Now, had they paid him many times that amount,</li>
<li>it would have been to no avail, until they appeased him, for thus said our sages—may their memory be for a blessing! ‘Our Rabbis taught: Even if he were to give</li>
<li>him all the riches in the world, he would not be forgiven until he asked him ( for pardon), for Scripture says: “Therefore, restore</li>
<li>the man’s wife, since he is a prophet,” etc.’ And (this is) to inform you //that// there is an obligation upon ʿIwāḍ, Yeshūʿā and Ḥasan</li>
<li>ha-Kohanim, sons of the late Jacob ha-Kohen—may he rest in Eden!—(to pay) our lord Maḍmūn, Prince of the Congregations, upon each</li>
<li>and every o[n]e of them, one pound of gold, for what they have done and opened their mouths wide</li>
<li>and written in their letters indecent things, suspicion and complaints and slander and things</li>
<li>that are not proper, and behaved brazenly. For that reason they are liable to fines. And they (the sages) have further said:</li>
<li>‘Whoever is liable to a fine is also liable to excommunication, and whoever is liable to excommunication is liable to flogging.</li>
<li>And whoever has been excommunicated and dies under excommunication—his coffin shall be stoned.’</li>
<li>See, gentlemen, what an evil tongue has caused, for there is no sin more grievous</li>
<li>than that. And slander is the cause of affliction, as they said: ‘It was taught: R. Eliezer [!] b. Parta</li>
<li>says: Come and see how great is the power of an evil tongue! Whence do we know (its power)? From the spies, for if one who</li>
<li>slanders his fellow man, all t[he more so . . .] [. . .] upon him</li>
<li>[. . .]</li>
