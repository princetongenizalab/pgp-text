                        <p>(23) This is to inform you, my brother, that </p>
<p>(24) I intend, God willing to come. I have taken out a (passport) {alt. tr.: certificate} other than that of Binyam,</p>
<p>(25) for he too is going up to Fustat {alt. tr.: traveling to Egypt}. I received {alt. tr.: collected} seventeen dinars. I inform you </p>
<p>(26) also that I wrote in Tyre many letters and sent them</p>
<p>(27) with Abraham Ibn al-Qarīṣ and to you as well. Furthermore, I sent with Abraham </p>
<p>(28) of al-Mahdiyya your letter and letters from me, and told him how I was rescued. Thank God </p>
<p>(29) I am well and healthy—may I never miss God’s favor </p>
<p>(30) under your auspices {alt. tr.: thanks to your auspiciousness}! However, on the day I disembarked, I was so ill</p>
<p>(31) that I did not expect to stay alive, and I wrote those letters (32) only out of duress. But He acted for the sake of His name, and on the fifth day [Margin] I recovered. </p>
