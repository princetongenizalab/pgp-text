I was obliged to write to you, my lord, these few, short 
lines, for I heard that you had arrived in your homeland. Therefore, I wish to ask
whether you are aware of news of my uncle, Abraham, known as Ben Yijū, for he had absented himself
from us for ages; then, last year, the year 911, we learned
that an epistle of his had arrived in Messina, but fell into the hands of my uncle Mevassēr, who took it <<and set out to meet him>>.
We did not see it, nor do we know its contents but are very eager {alt. tr.: anxious} to hear
about him (Uncle Abraham) {alt. tr.: anything about his circumstances}. Therefore, I ask you now, my lord, to kindly send me, your servant
a letter, informing me whether you know any news of him or not, whether you have seen him, and in which 
place he is found at present. If you think it possible that I should {lit., ‘if you deem appropriate to instruct me to’} write an epistle, which would be forwarded to him
through your endeavors and favor, please, send me a letter to this effect
quickly. This will be a kindness on your part, which will be rewarded and thanked.
