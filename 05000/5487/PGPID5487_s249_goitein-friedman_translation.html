<li>I was obliged to write to you, my lord, these few, short </li>
<li>lines, for I heard that you had arrived in your homeland. Therefore, I wish to ask</li>
<li>whether you are aware of news of my uncle, Abraham, known as Ben Yijū, for he had absented himself</li>
<li>from us for ages; then, last year, the year 911, we learned</li>
<li>that an epistle of his had arrived in Messina, but fell into the hands of my uncle Mevassēr, who took it &lt;&lt;and set out to meet him&gt;&gt;.</li>
<li>We did not see it, nor do we know its contents but are very eager {alt. tr.: anxious} to hear</li>
<li>about him (Uncle Abraham) {alt. tr.: anything about his circumstances}. Therefore, I ask you now, my lord, to kindly send me, your servant</li>
<li>a letter, informing me whether you know any news of him or not, whether you have seen him, and in which </li>
<li>place he is found at present. If you think it possible that I should {lit., ‘if you deem appropriate to instruct me to’} write an epistle, which would be forwarded to him</li>
<li>through your endeavors and favor, please, send me a letter to this effect</li>
<li>quickly. This will be a kindness on your part, which will be rewarded and thanked. </li>
