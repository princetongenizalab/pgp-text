Recto


In God’s name. His servant Joseph b. ʿAllān {read: ʿIwāḍ}, the Alexandrian kisses the earth before the lofty seat of his illustrious lordship


R. Ḥananel, the wise and the discerning, son of his honor, great and holy master


and lord, Samuel the esteemed elder, the munificent and the noble—may his end surpass


his beginning and may his days last until he sees your living male


child And may He render your praise good in this world and the next world!


This is to inform you that I am from a well-to-do family and that my father was one of the India


travelers. God had bestowed upon us {alt. tr.: them} His grace. My lord your father is acquainted with


my father and my brother Futūḥ, who recently traveled to Yemen


and died on the ship. Sheikh Maḍmūn took his possessions


and sent them to his heirs in Alexandria. He (Futūḥ) had previously willed me something,


when he set out on his journey. That is, should his appointed time overtake him, something would be given to me


from his estate. But the document was not written according to legal procedure,


because the two of us were in a wine party. I, your servant, went up


to his excellency our lord—may his grandeur increase!—and complained to him.


He wrote a number of letters to the congregation about me, in order that I might


get something to support my family, which has in it nine


People. In short, I am now in a state of hunger and thirst


and naked and lacking everything. I ask God and you


to give me a thawb (robe), with which I can enter the synagogue and hear ‘Holy’


and ‘Blessed,’ for the sake of Dear God, after (I had) niṣāfī and sābūrī
