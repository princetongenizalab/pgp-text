                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In God&rsquo;s name. His servant Joseph b. ʿAllān {read: ʿIwāḍ}, the Alexandrian kisses the earth before the lofty seat of his illustrious lordship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R. Ḥananel, the wise and the discerning, son of his honor, great and holy master</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and lord, Samuel the esteemed elder, the munificent and the noble&mdash;may his end surpass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his beginning and may his days last until he sees your living male</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>child And may He render your praise good in this world and the next world!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is to inform you that I am from a well-to-do family and that my father was one of the India</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>travelers. God had bestowed upon us {alt. tr.: them} His grace. My lord your father is acquainted with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my father and my brother Futūḥ, who recently traveled to Yemen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and died on the ship. Sheikh Maḍmūn took his possessions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and sent them to his heirs in Alexandria. He (Futūḥ) had previously willed me something,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when he set out on his journey. That is, should his appointed time overtake him, something would be given to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from his estate. But the document was not written according to legal procedure,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because the two of us were in a wine party. I, your servant, went up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to his excellency our lord&mdash;may his grandeur increase!&mdash;and complained to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He wrote a number of letters to the congregation about me, in order that I might</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get something to support my family, which has in it nine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People. In short, I am now in a state of hunger and thirst</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and naked and lacking everything. I ask God and you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give me a thawb (robe), with which I can enter the synagogue and hear &lsquo;Holy&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and &lsquo;Blessed,&rsquo; for the sake of Dear God, after (I had) niṣāfī and sābūrī</p>
</li>
</ol>
