[A]  Conventional opening of letter (lines 1–5).
[B]  Arrival of imports from India and jettisoning of freight when attacked by pirates (lines 5–15)

 

 


 


 


I, your servant, took notice 


of what you—may God preserve your well- being!—wrote 


concerning the shipment of 15 bahārs of ‘standard’ iron


and seven bahars of belts (?) of ‘eggs.’  This is to inform you that the sailors


jettisoned some of the ‘eggs’ when the pirates (al-surrāq) [approached]


the gulf Fam al-Khawr (alt. tr.: on the mouth of the gulf ). But I, your servant, already distributed it (the loss)


according to the freight of the ship, and I collected this for you. 


And I, your servant, already sold for you the ‘standard’ iron, the ‘eggs’ and the cardamom, 


which arrived with Sheikh Mahrūz. All of this 


is detailed in the copy of the account, accompanying this letter, 


that you are reading, God willing.  


[C] Arrival of copper from {Aydhāb in two small matiyya boats to be followed by other commodities in four ships (lines 15–20).}
