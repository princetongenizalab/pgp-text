<li> Your servant {lit., ‘the property of his hands’} took notice</li>
<li>of your inquiry, my lord, about the</li>
<li>news of the roads and the reconciliation between the Dā'ī</li>
<li>and his adversaries.</li>
<li>I am able to inform you, my lord,</li>
<li>that even one or two persons can travel on any road,</li>
<li>and that the whole country is peaceful. Likewise, the Dā'ī has been reconciled</li>
<li>with all his enemies and has received from them </li>
<li>hostages. All the ships have arrived</li>
<li>safely. Sheikh Maḍmūn—may God remember him favorably {alt. tr: may he be remembered for a blessing!}—has seized</li>
<li>the entire two shops, and nothing remains in the possession of Ibrahīm</li>
<li>except the doorway and the room for the manufacture of wine. This was done out of compassion</li>
<li>by him (Maḍmūn) for the people. Now I pray to the God of Israel to protect you</li>
<li>from all misfortunes and calamities. Please </li>
<li>do not ask me, my lord, what I experienced from Mūsā</li>
<li>b. Mevōrākh and his malicious joy at my misfortune over the loss</li>
<li>of my shop. Yes, my shop was taken away from me by force {alt. tr.: I was robbed only of my shop}.</li>
</ol>

<li>Receive for your honored self the best </li>
<li>greetings, and do not defer your travel—may God assist you!—</li>
<li>indeed, to our place. And please, do not travel </li>
<li>except in the company of people on whom you can rely.</li>
<li>May peace for you overtake</li>
<li>peace!</li>
<li>This letter was written in a hurry. </li>
