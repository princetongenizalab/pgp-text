 Your servant {lit., ‘the property of his hands’} took notice
of your inquiry, my lord, about the
news of the roads and the reconciliation between the Dā'ī
and his adversaries.
I am able to inform you, my lord,
that even one or two persons can travel on any road,
and that the whole country is peaceful. Likewise, the Dā'ī has been reconciled
with all his enemies and has received from them 
hostages. All the ships have arrived
safely. Sheikh Maḍmūn—may God remember him favorably {alt. tr: may he be remembered for a blessing!}—has seized
the entire two shops, and nothing remains in the possession of Ibrahīm
except the doorway and the room for the manufacture of wine. This was done out of compassion
by him (Maḍmūn) for the people. Now I pray to the God of Israel to protect you
from all misfortunes and calamities. Please 
do not ask me, my lord, what I experienced from Mūsā
b. Mevōrākh and his malicious joy at my misfortune over the loss
of my shop. Yes, my shop was taken away from me by force {alt. tr.: I was robbed only of my shop}.

Margin

Receive for your honored self the best 
greetings, and do not defer your travel—may God assist you!—
indeed, to our place. And please, do not travel 
except in the company of people on whom you can rely.
May peace for you overtake
peace!
