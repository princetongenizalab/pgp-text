In Your name, O Merciful. 
For the Lord will be your trust; He will keep your feet from being caught. You will decree and it will be fulfilled, etc.
My letter to my lord and master, the most illustrious sheikh—may God give you long life and make permanent your well-being!—
written in a state of well-being and good health, with strong longing for you. May God soon reunite me with you 
in the best of circumstances, through His favor and grace, for He is omnipotent and trustworthy! 
You will be pleased to know, my lord, that I arrived in complete safety at 'Aydhāb. 
Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love, etc. My lord, the little one, my daughter, cries day and night over
your (pl.) separation from her. May God facilitate //her// reunion with you—God willing—in the best of circumstances!
I am making a great effort to accomplish this. Were I able to make a sale in 'Aydhāb, I would sell and return.
But only what God decrees will come about. I have heard that you had mentioned that I owe you the balance
of an account and that the smaller packages left in the warehouse do not cover the sum. Your account, 
my lord, is this: I owe you five dirhems, no more no less! You already made an accounting with me for it. 
If there is good iron in the warehouse, which will cover the sum, after you kindly 
give instructions to someone to sell the smaller packages left in the warehouse, fine. If your servant still owes something, I am not 
running away. What I still owe is not worth talking about. I shall either arrive,
God willing, in Aden and pay you, or I shall send something of that value, or you can collect from 
the nākhudā Ma'ālī or from my lord and master Sheikh Khalaf...
