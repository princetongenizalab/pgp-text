there was in the ship an unlimited amount 
</li>
<li>
of diversified goods. Never has a ship like this sailed to 
</li>
<li>
 India. But God ordered this, and there is 
</li>
<li>
no escape from Him [and from] His judgment. He, who has the power to decree, 
</li>
<li>
decrees. God, the Exalted, may recompense me and you
</li>
<li>
and everyone! God is my witness that 
</li>
<li>
my anguish over the losses of o[thers is greater than that] 
</li>
<li>
over my own. For it is hard [. . .]

<li>And after this he [Bama] went and rented himself a place and said,</li>
<li>“Provide me with sufficient living expenses.” So he took from me</li>
<li>eight dinars for living expenses during four months. Most of the</li>
<li>time he came to me under the inÁuence of drink, not hearing</li>
<li>a word I said. I don’t know what purpose you had, my lord,</li>
<li>in sending him. Your (load of ) pepper arrived,</li>
<li>that is the one in the ship of the nākhudā Abu ’l-Ḥasan b. Abu</li>
<li>’l-Katāʾib. The weight: twenty-two bahārs and sixty pounds</li>
<li>This year, at the beginning of seafaring time, the son of al-ʿAmīd,</li>
<li>the ruler of Kīs, sent an expedition against Aden. He had demanded part of Aden, which</li>
<li>was refused, whereupon he sent this expedition. His fleet consisted of two burmas {read: nrmhs},</li>
<li>three shaffāras, and ten jāshujiyyas, altogether manned with</li>
<li>about 700 men. They anchored in the harbor (makallaʾ) of Aden, lying in wait for</li>
<li>(the incoming) ships, but did not enter the town. The people of the town were very much</li>
<li>afraid of them, but God did not give them victory and success.</li>
<li>Many of their men were killed, their ships were pierced (with spears), and they died of thirst</li>
<li>and hunger. The first of the merchants’ fleet to arrive were the two vessels of the nākhudā</li>
<li>Rāmisht. They (the enemy) attacked them, but God did not give them victory. As soon as the two ships</li>
<li>entered the port (bandar), they were boarded by a large number of regular troops,</li>
<li>whereupon they (the enemy) were driven from the port and began to disperse {alt. tr.: go in circles} on the open sea.</li>
<li>Thus, God did not give them victory. They made off in the most ignominious way, having suffered great losses</li>
<li>and humiliation {alt. tr.: having suffered many killed and great losses}. The news from Egypt was mediocre.</li>
<li>(As a result) goods sold poorly, and there was no demand for even a dirhem’s worth of pepper</li>
<li>or (other) merchandise, except a week before sailing.</li>
<li>Had I asked the owners of the pepper for the ‘tithe,’ they would have sold it</li>
<li>for less than 20. So I was patient with them for the ‘tithe’</li>
<li>up to the day of sailing, until people came from all over</li>
<li>and the price of pepper was fixed at 23 dinars per bahār. The proceeds </li>
<li>of the pepper listed above amounted to 510 ½ dinars</li>
<li>and two qīrāṭs (1/12). The sack of cardamom, delivered by Yāqūt al-Tanjī</li>
<li>at the sale in the ‘house,’ turned out to weigh one bahār and 222</li>
<li>pounds, price (per bahār) 48 (dinars); total {alt. tr.: proceeds} 83 ½ dinars. The weight of the other</li>
<li>sack was two bahārs less seven pounds, at a price of 45 (dinars);</li>
<li>total {alt. tr.: proceeds} 89 dinars. Also your credit: Yāqūt delivered,</li>
<li>in exchange for half an (Egyptian) mithqāl, which you {alt. tr.: he} still owed, two (Malikī) dinars</li>
<li>less one-quarter. Total of your assets:</li>
<li>685 dinars, less one-sixth.</li>
<li>You owe: the ‘tithe’ on the pepper, 155 ⅓ dinars and two qīrāṭs (1/12)</li>
<li>the cost of baskets of palm leaves and the porter, 2 ½ dinars and two qīrāṭs (1/12);</li>
<li>for two sacks of cardamom, (whose) weight in the Furḍa was three bahārs and 109 {read: 110} pounds,</li>
<li>the ‘tithe’ was 19 ½ dinars. You owe (also): the living expenses</li>
<li>of your servant for four months, from Iyyar to the end of Ab: 8</li>
<li>dinars; the registration fee for the captain Bakhtiyār, one dinar; the sum of</li>
<li>five niṣāfīs (for) glass and five cups {alt. tr.: jars}, firmly set {alt. tr.: of muḥkam glass} in baskets, a dinar;</li>
<li>given to Bama, a quarter-dinar for purchasing glass tumblers;</li>
<li>four Berbera mats and {alt. tr.: for} one niṣāfī; a hide—one dinar;</li>
<li>an iron pan—two-thirds d.; a sieve one-third d.;</li>
<li>for a niṣāfī, twelve pounds of soap; two chickpea-patterned (dotted)</li>
<li>Egyptian fūṭas, worth four dinars; a woolen fulled fūṭa,</li>
<li>3 ½ dinars. The total of all these {add: retail} items </li>
<li>[...five bahārs of yellow copper…the tax for the yellow copper]</li>
