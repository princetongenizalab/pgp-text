there was in the ship an unlimited amount 
</li>
<li>
of diversified goods. Never has a ship like this sailed to 
</li>
<li>
 India. But God ordered this, and there is 
</li>
<li>
no escape from Him [and from] His judgment. He, who has the power to decree, 
</li>
<li>
decrees. God, the Exalted, may recompense me and you
</li>
<li>
and everyone! God is my witness that 
</li>
<li>
my anguish over the losses of o[thers is greater than that] 
</li>
<li>
over my own. For it is hard [. . .]

<li>And after this he [Bama] went and rented himself a place and said,</li>
<li>“Provide me with sufficient living expenses.” So he took from me</li>
<li>eight dinars for living expenses during four months. Most of the </li>
<li>time he came to me under the inÁuence of drink, not hearing</li>
<li>a word I said. I don’t know what purpose you had, my lord,</li>
<li>in sending him. Your (load of ) pepper arrived,</li>
<li>that is the one in the ship of the nākhudā Abu ’l-Ḥasan b. Abu </li>
<li>’l-Katāʾib. The weight: twenty-two bahārs and sixty pounds</li>
<li>
This year, at the beginning of seafaring time, the son of al-ʿAmīd,
</li>
<li>
the ruler of Kīs, sent an expedition against Aden. He had demanded part of Aden, which
</li>
<li>
was refused, whereupon he sent this expedition. His fleet consisted of two burmas {read: nrmhs},
</li>
<li>
three shaffāras, and ten jāshujiyyas, altogether manned with
</li>
<li>
about 700 men. They anchored in the harbor (makallaʾ) of Aden, lying in wait for
</li>
<li>
(the incoming) ships, but did not enter the town. The people of the town were very much
</li>
<li>
afraid of them, but God did not give them victory and success.
</li>
<li>
Many of their men were killed, their ships were pierced (with spears), and they died of thirst
</li>
<li>
and hunger. The first of the merchants’ fleet to arrive were the two vessels of the nākhudā 
</li>
<li>
Rāmisht. They (the enemy) attacked them, but God did not give them victory. As soon as the two ships
</li>
<li>
entered the port (bandar), they were boarded by a large number of regular troops,
</li>
<li>
whereupon they (the enemy) were driven from the port and began to disperse {alt. tr.: go in circles} on the open sea.
</li>
<li>
Thus, God did not give them victory. They made off in the most ignominious way, having suffered great losses 
</li>
<li>
and humiliation {alt. tr.: having suffered many killed and great losses}. The news from Egypt was mediocre. 
</li>
<li>
(As a result) goods sold poorly, and there was no demand for even a dirhem’s worth of pepper
</li>
<li>
or (other) merchandise, except a week before sailing.
</li>
<li>
Had I asked the owners of the pepper for the ‘tithe,’ they would have sold it
</li>
<li>
for less than 20. So I was patient with them for the ‘tithe’
</li>
<li>
up to the day of sailing, until people came from all over 
</li>
<li>
and the price of pepper was fixed at 23 dinars per bahār.
