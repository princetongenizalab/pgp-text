<li>[...] will come with him [...]</li>
<li>My lord inquired about Zikrī b. Abu ʾl-Faraj of Tripoli.</li>
<li>He arrived in complete safety, sold, bought, finished his affairs,</li>
<li>and returned home in the same year. Sheikh Nahray b. ʿAllān arrived with him, carrying </li>
<li>a power of attorney from the son of Nissīm b. Benāyā. Zikrī of Tripoli,</li>
<li>too, had a power of attorney from the families of the two Maghrebis, who perished</li>
<li>in the boat of Jaʿfar. I took notice of the two writs.</li>
<li>The two dead men had deposited with me 140 Malikī dinars.</li>
<li>With this sum they bought two bales of lac, containing 1,000 pounds,</li>
<li>for 113 dinars, the expenses {alt. tr.: toll} for these two bales being 13 dinars. They bought Qaṣṣī fabrics for 14 dinars</li>
<li>to cover the expenses of the customs in ʿAydhāb and the freight for the way through the desert. This makes a total of</li>
<li>140 dinars. The two attorneys agreed to put</li>
<li>this shipment into the hand of Abraham, son of the Reliable Claimant, in order,</li>
<li>God willing, to carry it to Fustat together with my merchandise.</li>
<li>When all of them are in Fustat, the two attorneys will go to court,</li>
<li>and each one’s right on this shipment will be established and he then will take it. {Alt. tr.: the two attorneys will litigate the case, and whoever’s claim is established will take it.} </li>
<li>Here in Aden there is no one who could decide this matter or (even) who knows the situation.</li>
<li>I took a writ of release from each of them and no longer have any responsibility with regard to this.</li>
<li>I also gave two bahārs (sacks) of lac</li>
<li>to Zikrī of Tripoli, as a gift to the family of al-Nafūsī in Tripoli,</li>
<li>for I have heard that they are very poor. I believe this</li>
<li>was the right thing to do. After asking God,</li>
<li>the Exalted, for guidance, I, your servant, constructed a boat in Aden and sent goods in {alt. tr.: and outfitted} it</li>
<li>to Ceylon in partnership with the most illustrious Sheikh Bilāl. Of our coreligionists these traveled in it:</li>
<li>Sālim, the son of the cantor, Ibn Ḥidāda (‘of the art of smithing’), and al-Baṭīṭī (‘maker of slippers’), and the goldsmith,</li>
<li>who had arrived here in his company, and the two goldsmiths, who came this</li>
<li>year, Abū ʿAlī and the Maghrebi. All these traveled</li>
<li>in the boat. May God ordain their safe arrival! Again I, your servant,</li>
<li>asked God, the Exalted, for guidance and sent with the most illustrious Sheikh</li>
<li>Nahray b. ʿAllān and with Sheikh Abraham b.</li>
<li>Abu ʾl-Ḥasan, known as son of the Reliable Claimant, and through</li>
<li>both, in partnership with the most illustrious Sheikh Bilāl b. Jarīr</li>
<li>al-Awḥadī sixty bales of lac, weighing 100 bahārs, and {add: for</li>
<li>the tolls in ʿAydhāb, customs and freight}, eight bales of pepper, to be sold</li>
<li>in ʿAydhāb for customs expenses {alt. tr.: tolls} and freight, and also 100 Qaṣṣī</li>
<li>thawbs (robes) for customs in Sawākin and other places. All this</li>
<li>belongs to the partnership. I, your servant, am asking you now, relying on</li>
<li>your acts of kindness, when this shipment arrives safely, God willing,</li>
<li>to kindly take delivery of one-half of the aforementioned bales and sell them</li>
<li>for me for whatever price God apportions as livelihood. After</li>
<li>the price is agreed upon {lit., ‘it becomes a specific amount of money’}, turn everything into gold</li>
<li>and silver—nothing else—and distribute it among {alt. tr.: divide it between}</li>
<li>various merchants, coreligionists, or others, if they are known</li>
<li>as reliable, and send it on. Leave some money in the hand of Abraham, son of the Reliable Claimant,</li>
<li>and if he {add: the aforementioned Abraham} has need for it, give him a loan of</li>
<li>100 mithqāls, from which he might derive profit.</li>
<li>Buy for him what he wishes, and let me know</li>
<li>in your letter what you have bought for him.</li>
<li>I also ordered him to buy for me a wickerwork basket with china: bowls, dishes,</li>
<li>and cups {alt. tr.: copper vessels for wine}, also for four mithqāls good rose marmalade, such as one prepares</li>
<li>for the household. I gave him {alt. tr.: I wrote and sent with him} a memorandum. Please have him act</li>
<li>accordingly. Also sent with them, exclusively for me, your servant,</li>
<li>sixty bags of Sēlī (Ceylon) cinnamon, each bag weighing 100 pounds, which makes a total of</li>
<li>twenty bahārs. Kindly take delivery of one-half of this, too,</li>
<li>and sell it for your servant for whatever price God, the Exalted, apportions.</li>
<li>Please keep the account for this apart, since it is exclusively for me, your servant.</li>
