<li>…</li>
<li>May He show them (?) [. . .!]</li>
<li>[M]ay our masters, most distinguished of our community, be granted much [blessing and well-being from Him Who makes] </li>
<li>peace in His high places and from those who go up and down on [the stairway… Beth-]El </li>
<li>and from the holy Torah, which is the Torah of Jekuthiel and from the Torah (!) and afte[r] </li>
<li>that from your brothers and friends and servants! And you are the pride of the whole community </li>
<li>who are from the city of Ṣanʿa who live in the city of Dhū Jibla, and of the whole community </li>
<li>who are from the town of Shabʿān \\and al-Thāri// who live in Dhū Jibla, large and small, </li>
<li>old and young, distinguished and lowly. </li>
<li>Know, our masters—may our God protect you!—that your servants and friends are well in al[l] </li>
<li>our limbs/and from all our sides/thanks to the benevolent care/of our God for us/and His mercy, which </li>
<li>has helped us/and has not left us./We will therefore give thanks and magnify His name, as it is written, “I will thank You, Lord, in the congregation,” </li>
<li>etc., and it is written, “May His name be exalted above every blessing and praise!” We have received the excellent letter </li>
<li>of our masters, and we rejoiced in it as one rejoices at reaping time and as one exults when dividing </li>
<li>spoils, and as one who obtains great spoils. That letter was the most gladdening letter </li>
<li>that arrived, and the most pleasing epistle that came. We, your servants, understood what you, our masters, mentioned</li>
<li>concerning the letters that had been received by his great and holy excellency, our lord and master, our lord Maḍmūn, Prince of</li>
<li>Princ[es, H]ead of the Congregations, son of his honor, great and holy master and lord Japheth—may his soul be bound up in the bond of life!—from R.</li>
<li>ʿIwāḍ and R. Ab[u ʾl-]Faraj and R. Ḥasan ha-Kohanim, children of [his honor, great and holy] master and lord, the late</li>
<li>Jacob ha-Kohen, may he r[est in] P[aradise]! It was said in their letters (approximately) that their late father had [entrusted] with the deceased,</li>
<li>our lord and master Bundār, may he be resurrected, a deposit, such as for a business deal, and it was recorded in [his books].</li>
<li>And you, our lords, mentioned that their father had come down after the passing of our lord, the late Bundār—may the Lord have mercy on</li>
<li>him!—to his excellency, our lord his brother Maḍmūn, and that the late Sheikh Jacob ha-Kohen, had searched</li>
<li>the account books that had belonged to our lord, the late Bundār, as stated by the sons of the late Jacob, \\our master//, and he found</li>
<li>what he had mentioned, and that our lord Maḍmūn had written him a writ (in his own hand) concerning that, and that witnesses had testified to him,</li>
<li>and that the writ and the testimony had been left with them by their late father. And we also understood</li>
<li>that our lord Maḍmūn had read their letters to him concerning this, and sent them an answer,</li>
<li>saying: If they have \\a writ// and testimony against him, let one of them bring that writ </li>
<li>and that testimony and sue him (Maḍmūn) according to the laws of Israel, and he will give them what is owed them. And you, our lords, mentioned that they</li>
<li>had sent him an answer, in which there were many things that had distressed our lord Maḍmūn</li>
<li>and annoyed and angered him. Afterwards, we your servants, were over- whelmed by </li>
<li>intense [regret] concerning that correspondence and the [affront…]</li>
<li>on the lord Maḍ[mūn [. . .]</li>
