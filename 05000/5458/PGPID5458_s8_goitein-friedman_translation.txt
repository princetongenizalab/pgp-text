In Your Name, O Merciful.
Your hand shall prevail over your foes, and all your enemies shall be cut down.
I am writing to you, my lord and master, my chief, the illustriouselder—
may God prolong your life and make permanent your promi-nent position,
may He be for you and with you and guard you in allyour affairs!
I am writing to you out of a strong longing—may Godmake us
meet together presently {alt. tr.: soon} in the best circumstances in His favor and bounty,
God willing, for it is up to Him and it is in His power alone!
I wish to inform you, my lord, that I had previously written to you
at Tāna. Meanwhile, the boat escorting the ship arrived,
and its soldiers told us that the ship
in which your excellency, my lord, traveled had been seized by pirates,
and I was very sad about this. But afterwards I praised God
and thanked Him, when I heard that your life was saved {lit., ‘I thanked Him for the safety of (your) life’}. Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love.
Everything can be replaced except life. I would indeed like to mention to you,
my lord, that your servant had a large shipment in the boat of
Fōfalī {read: al-Fawfalī} (‘Betel nut merchant’), then God ordained what happened;in the end,
however, God compensated me—praise and thanks to Him! Like wise, my lord,
do not be sad. God will replace your loss to you soon; you will live, God willing,
and God will compensate you many times. Your servant had thought
that your honor my lord was in Tāna, and I had previously sent
letters to the nākhudā Tinbū, advising him to pay to my lord
21 [or: as much as 20] mithqāls (Egyptian dinars) or more. After wards, however,
my lord the Sheikh Abu ʾl-Qāsim Ibn Qaṭṭān (‘Dealer in cotton’) came to Mangalore.
I inquired about you,
and he told me that your excellency was in Broach.
Under all circumstances, please come quickly to Mangalore
and do not tarry, for I am waiting here {alt. tr.: delayed} in Mangalore
and—God willing—we {alt. tr.: I} shall embark on our {alt. tr.: my} way home as soon as possible {alt. tr.: at the beginning of the season. <<I wanted you to know this.>>}
It is better for you to travel from Mangalore with me
than to travel in the ships of foreign {alt. tr.: other} people. Please remember
that there is no difference between us, my money is yours; it is just the same.
The boats start presently {alt. tr.: set out at the beginning of the season} from yourplace,
from Kanbāyat, and from Tāna; please set out im mediately
so that you reach Mangalore with the vessels, which
will soon be arriving {alt. tr.: make every possible eﬀort to reach Mangalore inthe maṭiyya vessels, which will be arriving at the beginning of the season} in Malibārāt, Kayākannūr {read: Fāknūr},
and Mangalore, God willing. If, my lord, you need
any gold, please take it on my account from the nākhudā Tinbū,
for he is staying in Tāna, and between him and me there are bonds of inseparable
friendship and brotherhood.
You will be pleased to know, my lord, that a sum in favor
of your excellency remained with me on account {alt. tr.: from the proceeds} of the silk.
With it I bought twelve [. . .], and sixteen large [bahārs] {read: twelve and a half large bahārs} pepper for you,
and I dispatched this for you under God’s protection {read: for you this year} from Mangalore
with the ‘Blessed’ ship—may God ordain her safety!
