<li>In Your Name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>Your hand shall prevail over your foes, and all your enemies shall be cut down.</li>
<li>I am writing to you, my lord and master, my chief, the illustriouselder&mdash;</li>
<li>may God prolong your life and make permanent your promi-nent position,</li>
<li>may He be for you and with you and guard you in allyour affairs!</li>
<li>I am writing to you out of a strong longing&mdash;may Godmake us</li>
<li>meet together presently {alt. tr.: soon} in the best circumstances in His favor and bounty,</li>
<li>God willing, for it is up to Him and it is in His power alone!</li>
<li>I wish to inform you, my lord, that I had previously written to you</li>
<li>at Tāna. Meanwhile, the boat escorting the ship arrived,</li>
<li>and its soldiers told us that the ship</li>
<li>in which your excellency, my lord, traveled had been seized by pirates,</li>
<li>and I was very sad about this. But afterwards I praised God</li>
<li>and thanked Him, when I heard that your life was saved {lit., &lsquo;I thanked Him for the safety of (your) life&rsquo;}. Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love.</li>
<li>Everything can be replaced except life. I would indeed like to mention to you,</li>
<li>my lord, that your servant had a large shipment in the boat of</li>
<li>Fōfalī {read: al-Fawfalī} (&lsquo;Betel nut merchant&rsquo;), then God ordained what happened;in the end,</li>
<li>however, God compensated me&mdash;praise and thanks to Him! Like wise, my lord,</li>
<li>do not be sad. God will replace your loss to you soon; you will live, God willing,</li>
<li>and God will compensate you many times. Your servant had thought</li>
<li>that your honor my lord was in Tāna, and I had previously sent</li>
<li>letters to the nākhudā Tinbū, advising him to pay to my lord</li>
<li>21 [or: as much as 20] mithqāls (Egyptian dinars) or more. After wards, however,</li>
<li>my lord the Sheikh Abu ʾl-Qāsim Ibn Qaṭṭān (&lsquo;Dealer in cotton&rsquo;) came to Mangalore.</li>
<li>I inquired about you,</li>
<li>and he told me that your excellency was in Broach.</li>
<li>Under all circumstances, please come quickly to Mangalore</li>
<li>and do not tarry, for I am waiting here {alt. tr.: delayed} in Mangalore</li>
<li>and&mdash;God willing&mdash;we {alt. tr.: I} shall embark on our {alt. tr.: my} way home as soon as possible {alt. tr.: at the beginning of the season. &lt;&lt;I wanted you to know this.&gt;&gt;}</li>
<li>It is better for you to travel from Mangalore with me</li>
<li>than to travel in the ships of foreign {alt. tr.: other} people. Please remember</li>
<li>that there is no difference between us, my money is yours; it is just the same.</li>
<li>The boats start presently {alt. tr.: set out at the beginning of the season} from yourplace,</li>
<li>from Kanbāyat, and from Tāna; please set out im mediately</li>
<li>so that you reach Mangalore with the vessels, which</li>
<li>will soon be arriving {alt. tr.: make every possible eﬀort to reach Mangalore inthe maṭiyya vessels, which will be arriving at the beginning of the season} in Malibārāt, Kayākannūr {read: Fāknūr},</li>
<li>and Mangalore, God willing. If, my lord, you need</li>
<li>any gold, please take it on my account from the nākhudā Tinbū,</li>
<li>for he is staying in Tāna, and between him and me there are bonds of inseparable</li>
<li>friendship and brotherhood.</li>
<li>You will be pleased to know, my lord, that a sum in favor</li>
<li>of your excellency remained with me on account {alt. tr.: from the proceeds} of the silk.</li>
<li>With it I bought twelve [. . .], and sixteen large [bahārs] {read: twelve and a half large bahārs} pepper for you,</li>
<li>and I dispatched this for you under God&rsquo;s protection {read: for you this year} from Mangalore</li>
<li>with the &lsquo;Blessed&rsquo; ship&mdash;may God ordain her safety!</li>
