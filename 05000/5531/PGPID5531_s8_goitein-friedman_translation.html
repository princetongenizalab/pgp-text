<li>[...] with him [...]</li>
<li>al-Sadīd—may [God] pro[lon]g [his life!—. . .]</li>
<li>the most illustrious nākhuda was kind enough (to assist) in what</li>
<li>you had already begun. Praise and thanks</li>
<li>are only to you. My lord, you</li>
<li>have already concerned yourself with the matter. Please complete it, for</li>
<li>kindness is yours in the past and recently. I request</li>
<li>of you, my lord, that you consider me one of</li>
<li>your devotees and servants. God already</li>
<li>knows and attests my love for my master.</li>
<li>Sheikh Abraham b. Yijū</li>
<li>has made little of a (the) load of five bahārs.</li>
<li>All the time I see him, he repeats to</li>
<li>me, your servant, his talk. I have become exasperated by him.</li>
<li>He says to me all the time: “Come back.” Then he makes himself scarce</li>
<li>and disappears, in a short day a hundred</li>
<li>times. I request that you act in the name of your esprit de corps</li>
<li>with me, in keeping with your customary acts of kindness and noble</li>
<li>character with me and with others, concerning</li>
<li>something that one has taken from another. I have already</li>
<li>spoken with the nākhudā</li>
<li>about this, and he said to me: “I shall look after you.”</li>
<li>I request of your exalted excellency</li>
<li>to take care of this, until you take</li>
</ol>

<li>[...] mithqāls in the city (of Aden), whatever there is that remains. I shall complete my business with it, with your assistance. Then I shall come to Aden and proclaim the graces of the Lord—may He be praised!—</li>
<li>[and your grace]. I entreat God blessed be He and you. Stand by me and strengthen your surroundings, my lord and master. May your patronage protect me and your assistance embrace me! I ask of the Holy One</li>

<li>blessed be He to increase all good things in</li>
<li>this world in your hands, make you successful, enable you to attain</li>
<li>your goals and make you, as</li>
<li>the Holy One blessed be He has already made you,</li>
<li>a permanent support. May He protect you from all</li>
<li>danger! Be kind enough, my lord</li>
<li>and master, to be present where your servant</li>
<li>is absent. May God make permanent your prosperity!</li>
<li>Expedite for your servant whatever</li>
<li>will be, in a (any) number of ways. Whatever there is</li>
<li>is from my load. I hope to receive whatever</li>
<li>is recovered soon, so that I can derive benefit</li>
<li>from it. Peace on your pure spirit and your virtuous soul.</li>
<li>May peace overtake peace!}</li>
