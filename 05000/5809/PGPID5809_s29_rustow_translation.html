                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I am writing to you, my lord and master &mdash; may God prolong your existence and make eternal your wellbeing, happiness and his protection for you &mdash; from&nbsp;</li>
<li>Damsīs on the eve of Sukkot &mdash; may God grant you very many years and may you merit the coming of the redeemer,&nbsp;</li>
<li>the building of Ariel and the ingathering of all Israel. I ask God to see you have a male child soon, amen.&nbsp;</li>
<li>My physical health is good, but am beset by worry from all sides. I ask God for salvation</li>
<li>and benefactions. Neither my condition nor my clothing (are good), but worst of all is the paucity of means. I ask salvation from God</li>
<li>in his compassion, and that he make good what has gone wrong with me, for he has the power to do as he wills. It had been a long time since</li>
<li>I have seen a letter from you among the letters that arrive with Salāma. Then there arrived my lord Abū l-Faraj</li>
<li>Nissim b. Banāyā, may God be his support, and when I asked him about a letter, he said: He hasn't given me a letter, but he does</li>
<li>send you an assignment, and says: "In the name of God repeatedly, don't move, don't travel to Fusṭāṭ, don't trouble yourself, because they've built&nbsp;</li>
<li>an edifice with the witness, and he has been appointed. He will bear false witness against me. This is grave assault. You also mentioned&nbsp;</li>
<li>in your letters that arrived with Ibn Salāma what happened to you with the Christian, may God remember him only for what&nbsp;</li>
<li>he deserves. I was bothered by your trouble with him and your telling him the truth as ʿAllūn used to tell it,</li>
<li>since he is a Christian and we are Jews, and he has no power of attorney whatsoever, since he is required to pay what&nbsp;</li>
<li>it was worth and (for?) what his speech was worth. But the truth was cut off from Fustat. What he said</li>
<li>to you was that you would ask him to produce an accounting and letters and the testimony of Ibn Shaʿyā. He already</li>
<li>wrote to me in his letters that he would demand this. My lord Abū l-ʿAlāʾ al-Shāmī arrived.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I asked him if he had a letter from you, my lord. He told me: He didn't give me anything, but he did tell him that what</li>
<li>my lord Nissim mentioned is (in fact) what happened. This was a month ago today, but</li>
<li>he (still) hasn't asked him to produce it. There was no point in speaking to him or in all this talk, because he acted</li>
<li>under pressure, doing and undoing, commanding and forbidding, but he had no choice at this time&nbsp;</li>
<li>but to form a partnership with a dhimmī. But out of honesty and valor (murūʾa), he should have kept me in the partnership (ṣuḥba) and&nbsp;</li>
<li>the mixed purse (mukhālaṭa), since his religion requires it. Then you mentioned that the conversation with him turned to you, my lord.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We will not ask about him; he is a Christian and I am a Jew, and he is neither my colleague nor my heir nor&nbsp;</li>
<li>a legal proxy. He has a tongue in his mouth and will say whatever he wants, he will unburden himself and look for someone to testify</li>
<li>and say what he believes to be true; but in the face of the truth, he will not be able to speak. As for me, I have a proof that I will bring.&nbsp;</li>
<li>All the same, one must trust in the God of Israel. How much property has passed out of my possession (?)</li>
<li>for the West (?), and God protected and shielded (me) (?). The reason for all this was luckless money, but had&nbsp;</li>
<li>I known that he would die, I wouldn't have done any of these things. But there is nothing to be done,&nbsp;</li>
<li>and what is happening to me now is harder for me than anything that happened to me before. I ask God&nbsp;</li>
