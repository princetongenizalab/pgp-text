Recto

I am writing to you, my lord and master — may God prolong your existence and make eternal your wellbeing, happiness and his protection for you — from 
Damsīs on the eve of Sukkot — may God grant you very many years and may you merit the coming of the redeemer, 
the building of Ariel and the ingathering of all Israel. I ask God to see you have a male child soon, amen. 
My physical health is good, but am beset by worry from all sides. I ask God for salvation
and benefactions. Neither my condition nor my clothing (are good), but worst of all is the paucity of means. I ask salvation from God
in his compassion, and that he make good what has gone wrong with me, for he has the power to do as he wills. It had been a long time since
I have seen a letter from you among the letters that arrive with Salāma. Then there arrived my lord Abū l-Faraj
Nissim b. Banāyā, may God be his support, and when I asked him about a letter, he said: He hasn't given me a letter, but he does
send you an assignment, and says: "In the name of God repeatedly, don't move, don't travel to Fusṭāṭ, don't trouble yourself, because they've built 
an edifice with the witness, and he has been appointed. He will bear false witness against me. This is grave assault. You also mentioned 
in your letters that arrived with Ibn Salāma what happened to you with the Christian, may God remember him only for what 
he deserves. I was bothered by your trouble with him and your telling him the truth as ʿAllūn used to tell it,
since he is a Christian and we are Jews, and he has no power of attorney whatsoever, since he is required to pay what 
it was worth and (for?) what his speech was worth. But the truth was cut off from Fustat. What he said
to you was that you would ask him to produce an accounting and letters and the testimony of Ibn Shaʿyā. He already
wrote to me in his letters that he would demand this. My lord Abū l-ʿAlāʾ al-Shāmī arrived. 
I asked him if he had a letter from you, my lord. He told me: He didn't give me anything, but he did tell him that what
my lord Nissim mentioned is (in fact) what happened. This was a month ago today, but
he (still) hasn't asked him to produce it. There was no point in speaking to him or in all this talk, because he acted
under pressure, doing and undoing, commanding and forbidding, but he had no choice at this time 
but to form a partnership with a dhimmī. But out of honesty and valor (murūʾa), he should have kept me in the partnership (ṣuḥba) and 
the mixed purse (mukhālaṭa), since his religion requires it. Then you mentioned that the conversation with him turned to you, my lord. 
We will not ask about him; he is a Christian and I am a Jew, and he is neither my colleague nor my heir nor 
a legal proxy. He has a tongue in his mouth and will say whatever he wants, he will unburden himself and look for someone to testify
and say what he believes to be true; but in the face of the truth, he will not be able to speak. As for me, I have a proof that I will bring. 
All the same, one must trust in the God of Israel. How much property has passed out of my possession (?)
for the West (?), and God protected and shielded (me) (?). The reason for all this was luckless money, but had 
I known that he would die, I wouldn't have done any of these things. But there is nothing to be done, 
and what is happening to me now is harder for me than anything that happened to me before. I ask God 
for redemption in his compassion, and he can say what he wants.
