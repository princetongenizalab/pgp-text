                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>I am writing, my lord and master &mdash; may God prolong your existence and make your glory, support, wellbeing</li>
<li>and happiness eternal &mdash; from Alexandria in the middle of Kislev, may God make its blessing known to you.</li>
<li>I would like to inform you that I have written several let&shy;ters to you and have not seen an answer to any of them, I hope due to some happy</li>
<li>distraction. My lord Abū l-Faḍl Zakariyā arrived, but the bales did not arrive with him</li>
<li>but remained behind in Rashīd,&nbsp;may God see to their safety. I inquired of him whether he had any letters from you</li>
<li>but did not find any with him.&nbsp;He informed me that he brought with him a letter to Abū Sḥaq Avraham</li>
<li>b. Faraḥ. I would like you to let me know the news of the silk (shesh) and whether it has been sold. Let me know its unit price</li>
<li>for the dyed variety.&nbsp;I rely only upon God and you for its sale. If my lord</li>
<li>[the elder] Abū Sulaymān b. Duwayda has arrived, please greet him on my behalf. If my master Abū l-Ḥajjāj is present (in Fustat),</li>
<li>give him my regards, and if he is in Būṣīr, convey my greetings to him (there).&nbsp;If you write to him, have him buy me a pair</li>
<li>[of pillows?] for sleeping.&nbsp;He must do this for me. O my brother, I continue to be amazed</li>
<li>[at your aspersions that I] give precedence to the needs of others over your own. What is the negligence you have observed on my part?</li>
<li>This has greatly offended me.</li>

<li>Please give my best regards to the elder Abu Saʿīd. I have already sent you the information conerning the six garments</li>
<li>[...] that are with my lord Abū l-Faḍl b. Khalaf al-Andalusī and can be found in his bundle of goods.  </li>
