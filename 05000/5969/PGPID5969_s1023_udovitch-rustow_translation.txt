Recto

I am writing, my lord and master — may God prolong your existence and make your glory, support, wellbeing
and happiness eternal — from Alexandria in the middle of Kislev, may God make its blessing known to you.
I would like to inform you that I have written several let­ters to you and have not seen an answer to any of them, I hope due to some happy
distraction. My lord Abū l-Faḍl Zakariyā arrived, but the bales did not arrive with him
but remained behind in Rashīd, may God see to their safety. I inquired of him whether he had any letters from you
but did not find any with him. He informed me that he brought with him a letter to Abū Sḥaq Avraham
b. Faraḥ. I would like you to let me know the news of the silk (shesh) and whether it has been sold. Let me know its unit price
for the dyed variety. I rely only upon God and you for its sale. If my lord
[the elder] Abū Sulaymān b. Duwayda has arrived, please greet him on my behalf. If my master Abū l-Ḥajjāj is present (in Fustat),
give him my regards, and if he is in Būṣīr, convey my greetings to him (there). If you write to him, have him buy me a pair
[of pillows?] for sleeping. He must do this for me. O my brother, I continue to be amazed
[at your aspersions that I] give precedence to the needs of others over your own. What is the negligence you have observed on my part?
This has greatly offended me.
