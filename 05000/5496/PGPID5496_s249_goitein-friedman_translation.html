<li><span lang="en">There appeared before us, we the signatories to this document, Umm&nbsp;al-{Izz d. Zur{a. </span></li>
<li><span lang="en">She said to us: "Testify to me and perform with me the symbolic act of obligation, as of now, will all the (binding) terms of deeds.</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">Write and sign that which I hereby&nbsp;declare in your presence, </span></li>
<li><span lang="en">willingly and not coerced. Give it to R. Joseph&nbsp;b. R. Perah[yā] </span></li>
<li><span lang="en">Ben Yijū. Namely, I have already collected from him&nbsp;twenty, good Ducan rubā{īs of legal tender, </span></li>
<li><span lang="en">full (weight), grain for grain, for which I have rented him an apartment, in my house&mdash;which I had purchased</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">[in the] neighborhood of the tower of the&nbsp;Rayyis&mdash;for forty years, at a rate of one half rubā{ī per year, for him to dwell</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">in [any] apartment&nbsp;that he chooses and of which he approves. We have agreed to this in the manner in which dwells everyone who</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">rents. Whatever falls into decay and requires repair, I shall repair for him just as any landlord does.</span></li>
<li>Whenever either of us desires to cancel the agreement or believes that he has suffered damages from the other and is not able</li>
<li>to live together with him, he will collect his money, after I settle accounts with him, deducting from the twenty rubā{īs</li>
<li>the amount for the period he shall have dwelled there until the time of the cancellation, at a rate of one-half&nbsp;rubā{ī&nbsp;per year,</li>
<li>just as I have rented to him." We wrote and signed the declaration which she had made in our presence,</li>
<li>after having performed with her the symbolic act of obligation, according to the most firm and binding regulations fixed by the ancients&nbsp;of blessed memory in circumstances such as</li>
<li>this [. . .]}&nbsp;</li>
