[. . . Reading your letter] brought me joy, [because of the news of your well-being and the success] 
of your affairs. I asked God—may He be praised!—[to increase]
for your excellency all that is good. And [I thanked Him]
and extolled Him for your well-being and the well- being of your
family; may God protect and guard them and make me
their ransom3 from all evil. Your excellency’s servant
inquires of you as to the welfare of the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū Sa'd
b. R. Nethanel4—may the Rock of Israel protect him!—the son of my paternal uncle, and the welfare of
the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū 'Alī b.
Abū 'Amr [or: 'Umar] of Ceylon. Let me know, 
your excellency, whether you intend to come to the mountains,
so that, were you to be coming, I would rent 
a house for your excellency. And if the city is agreeable to you,
that is Aden, inform me thereof,
so that I can act accordingly. I shall have no difficulty
in traveling to Aden, God willing,
soon. Your excellency’s servant has much longing
and yearning for you. May God show me the countenance
of my lord soon! For your eminent
excellency and their excellencies, the two children,
the best, most profuse greetings. As to
what you expressed in your esteemed letter concerning
the action of our master the Prince of the Lord's People with you. May 
his customary acts of kindness such as this never cease with 
all mankind! May the Holy one blessed be He compensate him for
all with complete good! Amen. May it thus
be willed! And Peace to you. May peace overtake
peace! And much salvation / from east and west.

Similarly, your excellency’s servant Fayrūz extends greetings to your excellency.
And all the children and Ḥasan extend greetings to all the excellencies. May your 
excellency’s servant receive an unequivo- cal reply concerning what you would like me to do! And Peace.
