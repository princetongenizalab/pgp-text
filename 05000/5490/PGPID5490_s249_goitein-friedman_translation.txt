[. . . Reading your letter] brought me joy, [because of the news of your well-being and the success] 
of your affairs. I asked God—may He be praised!—[to increase] 
for your excellency all that is good. And [I thanked Him] 
and extolled Him for your well-being and the well- being of your 
family; may God protect and guard them and make me 
their ransom3 from all evil. Your excellency’s servant 
inquires of you as to the welfare of the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū Sa'd 
b. R. Nethanel4—may the Rock of Israel protect him!—the son of my paternal uncle, and the welfare of 
the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū 'Alī b. 
Abū 'Amr [or: 'Umar] of Ceylon. Let me know, 
your excellency, whether you intend to come to the mountains,
so that, were you to be coming, I would rent 
a house for your excellency. And if the city is agreeable to you, 
that is Aden, inform me thereof, 
so that I can act accordingly. I shall have no difficulty 
in traveling to Aden, God willing, 
soon. Your excellency’s servant has much longing 
and yearning for you. May God show me the countenance 
of my lord soon!

Similarly, your excellency’s servant Fayrūz extends greetings to your excellency.
And all the children and Ḥasan extend greetings to all the excellencies. May your 
excellency’s servant receive an unequivo- cal reply concerning what you would like me to do! And Peace.
