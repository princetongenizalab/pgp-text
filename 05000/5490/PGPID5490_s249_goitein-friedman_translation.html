<li>[. . . Reading your letter] brought me joy, [because of the news of your well-being and the success]&nbsp;</li>
<li>of your affairs. I asked God&mdash;may He be praised!&mdash;[to increase]</li>
<li>for your excellency all that is good. And [I thanked Him]</li>
<li>and extolled Him for your well-being and the well- being of your</li>
<li>family; may God protect and guard them and make me</li>
<li>their ransom3 from all evil. Your excellency&rsquo;s servant</li>
<li>inquires of you as to the welfare of the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū Sa'd</li>
<li>b. R. Nethanel4&mdash;may the Rock of&nbsp;Israel protect him!&mdash;the son of my paternal uncle, and the welfare of</li>
<li>the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū 'Alī b.</li>
<li>Abū 'Amr [or: 'Umar] of Ceylon. Let me know,&nbsp;</li>
<li>your excellency, whether you intend to come to the mountains,</li>
<li>so that, were you to be coming, I would rent&nbsp;</li>
<li>a house for your excellency. And if the city is agreeable to you,</li>
<li>that is Aden, inform me thereof,</li>
<li>so that I can act accordingly. I shall have no difficulty</li>
<li>in traveling to Aden, God willing,</li>
<li>soon. Your excellency&rsquo;s servant has much longing</li>
<li>and yearning for you.&nbsp;May God show me the countenance</li>
<li>of my lord soon! For your eminent</li>
<li>excellency and their excellencies, the two children,</li>
<li>the best, most profuse greetings. As to</li>
<li>what you expressed in your esteemed letter concerning</li>
<li>the action of our master&nbsp;the Prince of the Lord's People&nbsp;with you. May&nbsp;</li>
<li>his customary acts of kindness such as this never cease with&nbsp;</li>
<li>all mankind! May the Holy one blessed be He compensate him for</li>
<li>all with complete good!&nbsp;Amen. May it thus</li>
<li>be willed! And Peace to you. May peace overtake</li>
<li>peace! And much salvation / from east and west.</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>Similarly, your excellency’s servant Fayrūz extends greetings to your excellency.</li>
<li>And all the children and Ḥasan extend greetings to all the excellencies. May your </li>
<li>excellency’s servant receive an unequivo- cal reply concerning what you would like me to do! And Peace.</li>
