<li>[. . . Reading your letter] brought me joy, [because of the news of your well-being and the success] </li>
<li>of your affairs. I asked God—may He be praised!—[to increase] </li>
<li>for your excellency all that is good. And [I thanked Him] </li>
<li>and extolled Him for your well-being and the well- being of your </li>
<li>family; may God protect and guard them and make me </li>
<li>their ransom3 from all evil. Your excellency’s servant </li>
<li>inquires of you as to the welfare of the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū Sa'd </li>
<li>b. R. Nethanel4—may the Rock of Israel protect him!—the son of my paternal uncle, and the welfare of </li>
<li>the most illustrious sheikh, my lord Abū 'Alī b. </li>
<li>Abū 'Amr [or: 'Umar] of Ceylon. Let me know, </li>
<li>your excellency, whether you intend to come to the mountains,</li>
<li>so that, were you to be coming, I would rent </li>
<li>a house for your excellency. And if the city is agreeable to you, </li>
<li>that is Aden, inform me thereof, </li>
<li>so that I can act accordingly. I shall have no difficulty </li>
<li>in traveling to Aden, God willing, </li>
<li>soon. Your excellency’s servant has much longing </li>
<li>and yearning for you. May God show me the countenance </li>
<li>of my lord soon! </li>
</ol>

<li>Similarly, your excellency’s servant Fayrūz extends greetings to your excellency.</li>
<li>And all the children and Ḥasan extend greetings to all the excellencies. May your </li>
<li>excellency’s servant receive an unequivo- cal reply concerning what you would like me to do! And Peace.</li>
