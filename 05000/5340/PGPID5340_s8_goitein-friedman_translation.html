<li>
<p>On Monday, the eighth day of the month of Iyyar, 1409 E.D.,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Jekuthiel, who is mentioned on the reverse side of this sheet, appeared in court and sued Mr. Joseph,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who is also mentioned together with him (overleaf), for a bale of ⟦liche⟧ dry storax weighing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>380 manns, asking where and under which circumstances it was sold. When Mr. Joseph was questioned about this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he said: “I sold 80 manns of that storax in Dahlak for 40</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dahlak dinars, worth ten Egyptian dinars, and took the remainder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with me to India, incurring expenses for customs, tithes and freight {alt. tr.: tolls}. The remainder was sold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for 120 Nahrwāra dirhems, worth about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eight Egyptian dinars.” Then Mr. Jekuthiel said (to the judge): “Ask him whether he carried the storax separately,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether he bought it on his own account, or carried something in it.” Lebdi said: “I carried in it corals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>belonging to me from Dahlak to India \\approximately one qirāṭ,// which did not require additional expenses all the way [alt. tr.: for which I was not required to pay a toll] to India. I carried it (the storax) to Nahr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wāra. When I arrived there, I took the corals out of it (the storax) and paid there for it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the customs and tithes (referred to before, but nothing for the corals,) for they are free of customs there {lit., ‘and tithes, because there are no dues on corals there’}. Nothing happened to the storax</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>until my arrival there and its sale. After efforts on my part, its proceeds were 120</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dirhems, as mentioned before.” Then Mr. Jekuthiel said: “I gave him 20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excellent Egyptian dinars, for expenses; ask him how they were spent.” Questioned about this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Joseph replied, providing details on those 20 dinars: “Of these I spent one dinar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a half for freight from here to Qūṣ.” Said Mr. Jekuthiel: “These one and a half dinars </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are charged to me for what?” Joseph replied: “For the storax, the lichen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the rest of the goods, such as the copper, the textiles, ⟦the cor(als)⟧, the dodder of thyme. This freight was received by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatān. Dues in Akhmīm and in Qūṣ amounted to one-eighth dinar each. When I arrived in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qūṣ, I bought canvas and equipment {alt. tr.: packing materials} for camel transport \\and salabī ropes// for about one-half dinar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halters and payment to the weigher: one-eighth dinar. Hiring two camels from Qūṣ to ʿAydhāb: 5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars for a weight of about 800 Laythī (pounds). Having arrived in ʿAydhāb,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I paid one-quarter dinar for the brushing {[lit., ‘combing’} of the {add: bag of} textiles and two qirāṭs for the porter, and put down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in ʿAydhāb five and a third dinars for the two camels and two qirāṭs for porters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
