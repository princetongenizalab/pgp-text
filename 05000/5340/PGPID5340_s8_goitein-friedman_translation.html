                        <ol>
<li>
<p>On Monday, the eighth day of the month of Iyyar, 1409 E.D.,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Jekuthiel, who is mentioned on the reverse side of this sheet, appeared in court and sued Mr. Joseph,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who is also mentioned together with him (overleaf), for a bale of ⟦liche⟧ dry storax weighing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>380 manns, asking where and under which circumstances it was sold. When Mr. Joseph was questioned about this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he said: “I sold 80 manns of that storax in Dahlak for 40</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dahlak dinars, worth ten Egyptian dinars, and took the remainder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with me to India, incurring expenses for customs, tithes and freight {alt. tr.: tolls}. The remainder was sold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for 120 Nahrwāra dirhems, worth about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eight Egyptian dinars.” Then Mr. Jekuthiel said (to the judge): “Ask him whether he carried the storax separately,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether he bought it on his own account, or carried something in it.” Lebdi said: “I carried in it corals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>belonging to me from Dahlak to India \\approximately one qirāṭ,// which did not require additional expenses all the way [alt. tr.: for which I was not required to pay a toll] to India. I carried it (the storax) to Nahr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wāra. When I arrived there, I took the corals out of it (the storax) and paid there for it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the customs and tithes (referred to before, but nothing for the corals,) for they are free of customs there {lit., ‘and tithes, because there are no dues on corals there’}. Nothing happened to the storax</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>until my arrival there and its sale. After efforts on my part, its proceeds were 120</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dirhems, as mentioned before.” Then Mr. Jekuthiel said: “I gave him 20</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excellent Egyptian dinars, for expenses; ask him how they were spent.” Questioned about this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Joseph replied, providing details on those 20 dinars: “Of these I spent one dinar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a half for freight from here to Qūṣ.” Said Mr. Jekuthiel: “These one and a half dinars </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are charged to me for what?” Joseph replied: “For the storax, the lichen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the rest of the goods, such as the copper, the textiles, ⟦the cor(als)⟧, the dodder of thyme. This freight was received by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatān. Dues in Akhmīm and in Qūṣ amounted to one-eighth dinar each. When I arrived in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qūṣ, I bought canvas and equipment {alt. tr.: packing materials} for camel transport \\and salabī ropes// for about one-half dinar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Halters and payment to the weigher: one-eighth dinar. Hiring two camels from Qūṣ to ʿAydhāb: 5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars for a weight of about 800 Laythī (pounds). Having arrived in ʿAydhāb,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I paid one-quarter dinar for the brushing {[lit., ‘combing’} of the {add: bag of} textiles and two qirāṭs for the porter, and put down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in ʿAydhāb five and a third dinars for the two camels and two qirāṭs for porters.</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Bodl. MS heb. d 66/65 65 recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In ʿAydhāb, I put down one-quarter dinar for repacking the stuff in two bales, as it had been before,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and one-quarter dinar for mats; for porters and the skipper of the boat: one-eighth dinar, paid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>before the two bales were laded. For the freight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from ʿAydhāb to Dahlak I paid six and a quarter dinars, and in Dahlak customs duties for the two pieces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>six dinars, after having given bribes to the amount of one dinar and two [qirāṭs]. For the freight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the piece of \\lichen// I paid 1 dinar from Dahlak to Aden.” He (Jekuthiel) also asked him (Joseph) about the corals,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which he had sent with him. He said: “Yes, I received them, traveled with them to Nahr-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wāra and exchanged them for 95,000 beads, which I put</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>into bales of lac, nine in all. Of these,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eight were lost by shipwreck; one bale (of lac) containing one bag (of beads) was saved </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and is here with me.” He asked him also about the 70 dinars obtained through the sale of </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>textiles and other goods in Dahlak, namely, what {add: ⟦you⟧} he bought for them. He replied: “I did not buy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>him anything for them, but took them with me in specie to Aden, to Ḥasan b. Bundār, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\\together with my own money// and asked Ḥasan to grant me an advance on 50 bahārs of pepper, ⟦\\of which// to Mr. Jekuthiel⟧ of which</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15 bahārs were for Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb. I assigned this to him \\in my heart.// I could</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not specify this expressly for Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb, lest something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>happen and the entire shipment would be lost.” Then he asked Joseph also about the lichen, the silver (vessels), the dodder of thyme,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the scammony. He replied: “I carried all these things with me to Aden in my own name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and stored them with {alt. tr.: I unloaded them at the place (warehouse) of} the representative (of the merchants) Ḥasan b. Bundār, also in my own name, but told him </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘sell them ⟦separately⟧ \\apart// (from my goods), for they belong to Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb.’ As to the copper, I sold a quantity of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which was not suitable for export to India, bought another type {lit., ‘a substitute for it’}, and sent it ⟦for him⟧ to the region of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pepper, to be sold there; so that pepper would be bought for its price by the agency of Ḥasan b. Bundār. I do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not exactly remember whether I did this in the name of Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb or in my own name.” Finally, Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Yaʿqūb said to this Mr. Joseph: “On whose orders did you do all these things you mentioned,</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p>such as shipping some goods (to India) and leaving others in Aden, and other actions, none of which I instructed you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to do?” He replied: “When you gave this to me, you said to me, ‘these goods are yours, do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with them ⟦as you see fit⟧, as you do with your own merchandise.’ Because of this, I did all those things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My handing over of goods {lit., ‘what I handed over’} to Ibn Bundār was done at your suggestion and on your instructions</p>
</li>

<p>for the purchase of pepper.” The proceedings</p>
