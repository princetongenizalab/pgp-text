Bodl. MS heb. d 66/64 64 Recto


On Monday, the eighth day of the month of Iyyar, 1409 E.D.,


Mr. Jekuthiel, who is mentioned on the reverse side of this sheet, appeared in court and sued Mr. Joseph,


who is also mentioned together with him (overleaf), for a bale of ⟦liche⟧ dry storax weighing


380 manns, asking where and under which circumstances it was sold. When Mr. Joseph was questioned about this,


he said: “I sold 80 manns of that storax in Dahlak for 40


Dahlak dinars, worth ten Egyptian dinars, and took the remainder


with me to India, incurring expenses for customs, tithes and freight {alt. tr.: tolls}. The remainder was sold


for 120 Nahrwāra dirhems, worth about


eight Egyptian dinars.” Then Mr. Jekuthiel said (to the judge): “Ask him whether he carried the storax separately,


whether he bought it on his own account, or carried something in it.” Lebdi said: “I carried in it corals


belonging to me from Dahlak to India \\approximately one qirāṭ,// which did not require additional expenses all the way [alt. tr.: for which I was not required to pay a toll] to India. I carried it (the storax) to Nahr


wāra. When I arrived there, I took the corals out of it (the storax) and paid there for it


the customs and tithes (referred to before, but nothing for the corals,) for they are free of customs there {lit., ‘and tithes, because there are no dues on corals there’}. Nothing happened to the storax


until my arrival there and its sale. After efforts on my part, its proceeds were 120


dirhems, as mentioned before.” Then Mr. Jekuthiel said: “I gave him 20


excellent Egyptian dinars, for expenses; ask him how they were spent.” Questioned about this,


Mr. Joseph replied, providing details on those 20 dinars: “Of these I spent one dinar


and a half for freight from here to Qūṣ.” Said Mr. Jekuthiel: “These one and a half dinars 


are charged to me for what?” Joseph replied: “For the storax, the lichen


and the rest of the goods, such as the copper, the textiles, ⟦the cor(als)⟧, the dodder of thyme. This freight was received by


Fatān. Dues in Akhmīm and in Qūṣ amounted to one-eighth dinar each. When I arrived in


Qūṣ, I bought canvas and equipment {alt. tr.: packing materials} for camel transport \\and salabī ropes// for about one-half dinar.


Halters and payment to the weigher: one-eighth dinar. Hiring two camels from Qūṣ to ʿAydhāb: 5


dinars for a weight of about 800 Laythī (pounds). Having arrived in ʿAydhāb,


I paid one-quarter dinar for the brushing {[lit., ‘combing’} of the {add: bag of} textiles and two qirāṭs for the porter, and put down


in ʿAydhāb five and a third dinars for the two camels and two qirāṭs for porters.
