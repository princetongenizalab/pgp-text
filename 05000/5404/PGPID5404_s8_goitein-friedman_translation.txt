Take notice that I have paid the 90 dinars, 


which I had owed, to their owner, and witnesses have signed the


receipt. Take notice of this. There was no


need to alert me to expedite


making this payment. {Alt. tr.: Inform me of any need you have, so that I can take care of it expeditiously.}


[Regards.]
