<li>In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>The letter of his excellency, the most illustrious Sheikh, my lord, has arrived—may God protect your life</li>
<li>and make permanent your honored position, rank, pre-eminence, supremacy, superiority and ascendancy!</li>
<li>May He never deprive your dwelling place and court of any good! May He prostrate in weakness {alt. tr.: crush in disgrace}</li>
<li>those that are envious of you and humiliate your enemies! May all your affairs be completed successfully {lit., ‘be joined by blessings’}! I read it</li>
<li>and comprehended it and was happy to learn about your well-being and that your affairs are in order. I praised God for this</li>
<li>very much and asked Him to give you more of all that is good, in His mercy. I, your servant, acknowledge,</li>
<li>my lord, your kind inquiry (about my well-being) {alt. tr.: your kind attention} and concern. May God concern Himself with bestowing favors upon you {alt. tr.: Himself favorably with you}</li>
<li>and may He avert from you the misfortunes of this world! May He unite us, after the completion of your affairs, soon,</li>
<li>not belatedly, in His might and His kindness, which is (a) sufficient (guarantee) {alt. tr.: and His bounteous kindness}! You detailed, my lord, what</li>
<li>was salvaged for me, your servant, in the shaffāra, namely half a bahār of big measure of pepper, less</li>
<li>a farāsila. However, you did not mention to me, your servant, anything about the ginger which had been carried in it,</li>
<li>namely, three bahārs of ginger, less one quarter, for you, my lord, had mentioned it to me in your letter of</li>
<li>last year, and (wrote) that the nākhudā had insisted on collecting the freight only {alt. tr.: refused to collect the freight except} from it.</li>
<li>This is what it says in your letter of last year, my lord, which is in my—your servant’s—possession, and that the (loss incurred by)</li>
<li>jettisoning (part of the cargo) from the shaffāra had been distributed over the (whole) cargo. Now I do not know whether you, my lord, forgot</li>
<li>to mention this in your letters or what the matter is {alt. tr.: what (else) happened}. For in your letters from</li>
<li>last year, which I, your servant, have kept, you explained that the proceeds from the silk, after</li>
<li>expenses {alt. tr.: tolls}, were 17 ½  mithqāls. You had bought me, your servant, three bahās less one quarter of ginger</li>
<li>for 11 mithqāls, the price being four mithqāls per bahār. The balance in my, your servant’s, favor: six</li>
<li>and a half mithqāls. From this, there had been deducted one mithqāl, the balance (due from the purchase) of {lit., ‘the difference from’} the iron last year.</li>
<li>There had remained a balance in my, your servant’s, favor of five and a half mithqāls. For this you had bought for me, your servant, pepper, half a bahār</li>
<li>of big measure, less one qirāṭ. This is what you had written to me, your servant, about the shaffāra last</li>
<li>year. Your letter concerning this, my lord, is still with me. Furthermore, my lord, please check what is due to me {alt. tr.: is my loss} from the distribution.</li>
<li>From the total proceeds for me, your servant, buy whatever God, the Exalted, apportions:</li>
<li>pepper or something else, and forward it with one of the first ships coming out {lit., ‘one of the ships coming out at the beginning of the season’}. Concerning</li>
<li>the cardamom owed by the kārdār—may God curse him!—I spoke with someone</li>
<li>about this, and he told me that the cardamom actually was on your account, and we had nothing to do with it {lit., ‘was exclusively for you and we have no share in it’}. You had</li>
<li>made a transaction with the kārdār in which your share was lost {alt. tr.: and he defaulted on it}, whereupon you charged it to us.</li>
<li>However, as do others, your servant sends you consignments, relying on you to buy merchandise that needs no</li>
<li>bartering or advance, but an available commodity, which, if its purchase is convenient, fine, and if not, it should be abandoned;</li>
<li>for whoever sends you a consignment, does not write: “advance me money for certain merchandise,” but:</li>
<li>“purchase for whatever price God apportions as livelihood, and send it.” However, my lord, the decision lies with you</li>
<li>in all matters. Sheikh Abū Iṣḥaq b. Joseph arrived this year and reported</li>
<li>that your brother Mevassēr had arrived in Egypt and wishes to go to your place. Please take note of</li>
<li>this. As to ‘the salted foods’ and the qaṣʿa-bowls, which you had sent with Maḍmūn b. Sālim:</li>
<li>While at sea, he boarded a ship of Fidyār, but left everything in the ship (which had transported him from India) So far,</li>
<li>there arrived from Zabīd only three qaṣʿa-bowls, one for Sheikh Maḍmūn, one for Sheikh</li>
<li>Joseph, and one for me, and the mōja wood destined for me, nothing else. I, your servant, sent you</li>
<li>what has no importance, namely a bottle of sugar and a bottle of raisins for the children—may God, the Exalted,</li>
<li>keep them with {alt. tr.: for} you! You asked, my lord, to buy a dinar’s worth of arsenic. But, it is not to be had in the town,</li>
<li>nor is ladanum. However, I bought you a dinar’s worth of paper,</li>
<li>30 sheets. There were forwarded to you also half a pound of kohl (antimony), half a pound of chewing gum and half a pound of vitriol.</li>
<li>This is from me, your servant. It cost nothing {alt. tr.: No charge}. As to the dinar for the paper, add it to my, your servant’s, account</li>
<li>for the ginger and pepper salvaged in the shaffāra and buy, my lord, what</li>
<li>God facilitates &lt;and send it&gt; in one of the ships heading (for Aden) {alt. tr.: arriving (here)}. There is no need, my lord, to give you advice. Receive, my master,</li>
<li>for your esteemed self the best greetings from me, your servant, and give the best greetings to my lords, your two children {alt. tr.: your two sons},</li>
<li>and greetings to Sheikh Bama. If you are able to buy some cardamom,</li>
<li>send it together with what you happen to buy {If there is some cardamom available, . . . with what you were able to buy}. And Peace.</li>
