This is to inform you—may God {add: keep you safe}!—that we arrived
in Messina in safety and good health—for which we must thank God, and not ascribe it to our own merit
or good deeds—after we had passed eight days on our journey. For a rainstorm
kept us back in Baqṭas. We paid the Christian skipper {alt. tr.: owner}
of the boat a fare of two rubāʾīs less one-quarter and stipulated {lit., ‘we made an agreement with him’} that he should let us disembark at the lighthouse
near Messina—the town is, indeed, visible from it. We embarked on Friday
night, in the company of a Jew, a Kohen, from Salerno, and were at sea until [...-]day, 
when we arrived at Baqṭas. There, however, a rainstorm befell us, and we stayed until Friday. We boarded
the boat (again) in the morning and arrived at a place called Mīlāṣ. There,
the (above-mentioned) Jew, along with Isaac, the son-in-law of Giovanna’s son {alt. tr.: of Ibn Giovanna}, disembarked and continued their travel by land.
The Christian skipper told us that we would not reach the lighthouse—the
place where we had agreed that he would let us off—before the Sabbath13 and said that 
we could disembark there whenever we arrived, but that he could not take a shortcut {alt. tr.: …and said, “Whenever I arrive there with you, I will let you disembark, because I cannot interrupt the journey.”}. As I was afraid
of desecrating the Sabbath, and of other things (as well), I took another boat {alt. tr.: hired a boat together with other people} for two-thirds of a rubāʿī,
and we arrived in Messina on Saturday. On Sunday, I inquired about my uncle
Mevassēr and found him there. He did not fall short, and we stayed with him. Then I inquired
about Ibn Siṭlūn and Ibn Bārūkh and found them. Ibn Siṭlūn said: “I shall take care
of your fare, and you will go up with me {alt. tr.: with us}, God willing.” Then I consulted my uncle and Ibn Siṭlūn
about Moses’ travel, and they said: “There is nothing to be gained by it. He had better {alt. tr.: It is better that he} go back to his father.”
But he insisted on setting out with me, so that he would not come back empty-handed {lit., ‘But he said: “My travel is absolutely necessary, so that I do not...”’}. Thus I am uncertain
with regard to him, and I have not received a letter from you giving instructions, or about your well-being,
as might be expected {lit., ‘a detailed letter or [one] about your circumstances, as people do’}. Now, please do not neglect to send a detailed letter
with information about your well-being and that of my mother and my brother, and do not worry
about us, for we are well. Ibn Siṭlūn let me copy 

recto, margins
the Commentary on ʿĒrūvīn by Rabbēnū Nissīm for him. And most of the people in the town have asked me to serve as a schoolmaster in his house, for the town lacks everything. Were the town not unfit for you to live in (you could find a good job here) {read: I would suggest that you come}. However, the town is mediocre; one cannot live here. (...Here, it requires an) effort {read: Its homes are filthy and its people make little effort} to study and to pray. Since we arrived, there has been no public prayer 
verso


in the afternoon and the evening, while the morning prayer is said


before dawn; at daybreak, they are already through with it.


If we lived here...,


we would miss the prayer {read: Whenever someone goes to the sea for his business—since the residential area of the town is not within view of it—he misses the prayer}; and it is impossible to walk in the streets here because of the [dir]t.
