<li>This is to inform you—may God {add: keep you safe}!—that we arrived</li>
<li>in Messina in safety and good health—for which we must thank God, and not ascribe it to our own merit</li>
<li>or good deeds—after we had passed eight days on our journey. For a rainstorm</li>
<li>kept us back in Baqṭas. We paid the Christian skipper {alt. tr.: owner}</li>
<li>of the boat a fare of two rubāʾīs less one-quarter and stipulated {lit., ‘we made an agreement with him’} that he should let us disembark at the lighthouse</li>
<li>near Messina—the town is, indeed, visible from it. We embarked on Friday</li>
<li>night, in the company of a Jew, a Kohen, from Salerno, and were at sea until [...-]day, </li>
<li>when we arrived at Baqṭas. There, however, a rainstorm befell us, and we stayed until Friday. We boarded</li>
<li>the boat (again) in the morning and arrived at a place called Mīlāṣ. There,</li>
<li>the (above-mentioned) Jew, along with Isaac, the son-in-law of Giovanna’s son {alt. tr.: of Ibn Giovanna}, disembarked and continued their travel by land.</li>
<li>The Christian skipper told us that we would not reach the lighthouse—the</li>
<li>place where we had agreed that he would let us off—before the Sabbath13 and said that </li>
<li>we could disembark there whenever we arrived, but that he could not take a shortcut {alt. tr.: …and said, “Whenever I arrive there with you, I will let you disembark, because I cannot interrupt the journey.”}. As I was afraid</li>
<li>of desecrating the Sabbath, and of other things (as well), I took another boat {alt. tr.: hired a boat together with other people} for two-thirds of a rubāʿī,</li>
<li>and we arrived in Messina on Saturday. On Sunday, I inquired about my uncle</li>
<li>Mevassēr and found him there. He did not fall short, and we stayed with him. Then I inquired</li>
<li>about Ibn Siṭlūn and Ibn Bārūkh and found them. Ibn Siṭlūn said: “I shall take care</li>
<li>of your fare, and you will go up with me {alt. tr.: with us}, God willing.” Then I consulted my uncle and Ibn Siṭlūn</li>
<li>about Moses’ travel, and they said: “There is nothing to be gained by it. He had better {alt. tr.: It is better that he} go back to his father.”</li>
<li>But he insisted on setting out with me, so that he would not come back empty-handed {lit., ‘But he said: “My travel is absolutely necessary, so that I do not...”’}. Thus I am uncertain</li>
<li>with regard to him, and I have not received a letter from you giving instructions, or about your well-being,</li>
<li>as might be expected {lit., ‘a detailed letter or [one] about your circumstances, as people do’}. Now, please do not neglect to send a detailed letter</li>
<li>with information about your well-being and that of my mother and my brother, and do not worry</li>
<li>about us, for we are well. Ibn Siṭlūn let me copy </li>

                        <p>the Commentary on ʿĒrūvīn by Rabbēnū Nissīm for him. And most of the people in the town have asked me to serve as a schoolmaster in his house, for the town lacks everything. Were the town not unfit for you to live in (you could find a good job here) {read: I would suggest that you come}. However, the town is mediocre; one cannot live here. (...Here, it requires an) effort {read: Its homes are filthy and its people make little effort} to study and to pray. Since we arrived, there has been no public prayer </p>

<li>
<p>in the afternoon and the evening, while the morning prayer is said</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>before dawn; at daybreak, they are already through with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we lived here...,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we would miss the prayer {read: Whenever someone goes to the sea for his business—since the residential area of the town is not within view of it—he misses the prayer}; and it is impossible to walk in the streets here because of the [dir]t.</p>
