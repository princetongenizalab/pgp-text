quickly. The elder Abū Saʿīd b. ʿAwkal paid me two bills, one connected with the matter that
is with the man in Darb al-Waḥal (Mud Alley). I obeyed your orders and went to him, and he said to me: These weren't 
the terms of your obligation to him. You were obligated to him only in a month. I didn't depart until he established that he would pay them to us sooner. 
I'm going to keep goign back to him until he reveals his ulterior motive. As for the other bill, I already told you that I received it 
after that. God willing, I will attempt to collect it and pay him from it what you told me to, and the remainder will go to my household, may (God) protect them.
As for my lord the elder you father, may God make his glory eternal, he is in the best of health and wellbeing, praise and thanks be to God.
But your mother, may God protect her and redeem her, is facing difficulties due to her situation, may God the exalted guard her with his eye of mercy.
I convey to your honored, exalted self the best greetings, and best greetings to your brother Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī, and to the group of 
our friends, best greetings. I ask you to write to me without delay, vouchsafing mention of your news, your situation and your (business) needs.
Whatever you order me, I shall obey. Peace. The one God is my sufficiency.
