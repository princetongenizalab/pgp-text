<li>quickly. The elder Abū Saʿīd b. ʿAwkal paid me two bills, one connected with the matter that</li>
<li>is with the man in Darb al-Waḥal (Mud Alley). I obeyed your orders and went to him, and he said to me: These weren't&nbsp;</li>
<li>the terms of your obligation to him. You were obligated to him only in a month. I didn't depart until he established that he would pay them to us sooner.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I'm going to keep goign back to him until he reveals his ulterior motive. As for the other bill, I already told you that I received it&nbsp;</li>
<li>after that. God willing, I will attempt to collect it and pay him from it what you told me to, and the remainder will go to my household, may (God) protect them.</li>
<li>As for my lord the elder you father, may God make his glory eternal, he is in the best of health and wellbeing, praise and thanks be to God.</li>
<li>But your mother, may God protect her and redeem her, is facing difficulties due to her situation, may God the exalted guard her with his eye of mercy.</li>
<li>I convey to your honored, exalted self the best greetings, and best greetings to your brother Abū l-Ḥasan ʿAlī, and to the group of&nbsp;</li>
<li>our friends, best greetings. I ask you to write to me without delay, vouchsafing mention of your news, your situation and your (business) needs.</li>
