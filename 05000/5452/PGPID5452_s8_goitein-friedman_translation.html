<li>
<p>[The letter of my lord, the most illustrious sheikh, arrived—may God make permanent your honored position, etc…and bestow upon you] all the gifts [He has destined for you.] {alt. tr.: [May He protect for your sake]that which is most suitable of all He has conferred upon you.} [...and may He] crush [those who en]vy [you]!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a most gladdening letter and a most delightful message; your servant read it and was made happy by reading it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I (humbly) ask Him whose power is exalted to grant us in His mercy a reunion quickly, in </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the near future, under joyful circumstances, when things are going well {alt. tr.: and excellent, pleasant conditions}.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From what you mentioned—may God preserve your honored position!—your servant learned about your troubles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and discomfort on the sea and otherwise; I ask God—may He be exalted!—to make the outcome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good. The pepper that had been bought for you, which you mentioned (in your letter), amounts to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thirty bahārs; of this you received by your own hand here in Aden—may God preserve it!—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the year 526, 56 dinars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for four bahārs, leaving you 26 bahārs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(From this) one bahār is to be deducted for ‘the share,’ as is the case with all merchants who have pepper bought for them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaving you after the discount 25 bahārs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the value of the drky a bahār and 250 (pounds), of large measure. Total:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>26 bahārs 250 pounds. From this the following deductions had to be made:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nine bahārs of large measure for Sheikh Abū Saʿīd b. Maḥfūẓ,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaving 17 bahārs and two hundred and fifty pounds,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that is, twenty-one bahārs and seventy pounds of small measure. The ‘tithe,’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the baskets of palm leaves, and the porter—159 ¼ dinars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sold the pepper for you at the highest price obtained by anyone, namely, for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>37 (dinars) per bahār. The total {alt. tr.: proceeds}, after (the fee of) the auctioneer,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is 783 dinars, leaving you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>623 ¾ dinars. You owe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price of the sugar, which is to be delivered (to you) by Sheikh Abū Saʿīd in Mangalore,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>five dinars. In the ship of the nākhudā Rāmisht, I sent for you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Pandarāʾinā (Fandarayna) with the nākhudā Aḥmad b. Bakhtiyār a bag of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>red copper; the number: ten pieces; the weight: a bahār and a half;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price: 102 dinars. Also, they exempted me from freight charges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please take delivery of this from the nākhudā Aḥmad b. Bakhtiyār. He also has</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bag of copper for Sheikh Abraham b. Fayyūmī. I sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to you with Sheikh Abū Saʿīd b. Maḥfūẓ, in the ship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Mubārak, to Mangalore—may God ordain his {alt. tr.: its} safe arrival!—100 Egyptian </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mithqāls, worth 253 dinars, and also with him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>260 Zabīdī dinars, matching Malikī (dinars) in weight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have also sent you some fine Jiblī niṣāfī (half-dinars) [. . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weight of 21 ¼ dinars, a total of [...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>⟦3⟧ 623 ¾ dinars [...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lord, please take delivery of this from the two aforementioned (people) [. . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You had mentioned that I would get the legal document signed {alt. tr.: written} by you fr[om]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Saʿīd. I have already received this. As for what you had mentioned ab[out]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[...that you did not r]eceive it from me in Aden for the value of the pepper,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord’s account is wrong—you only imagine it. I have the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[What is (written) in the a]ccount book {alt. tr.:...imagine it. What is written with me [in the a]ccount book} is more exact. Concerning your orders to purchase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>various items, you know, my lord, of all the responsibilities I have {alt. tr.: of all my preoccupations} besides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(the business of ) the ships, and this is something which takes time. Especially in this </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>year, no imports arrived from Zabīd until the ships had sailed (from here),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>since they had remained in their city to celebrate the holiday, and then {alt. tr.: and will} set sail from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zabīd after the holiday. Gl[ass] also is n[ot to be found] in Aden.</p>

<li>
<p>[. . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[. . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[. . .] this [. . .], God willing. As for what you mentioned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[...to buy] silver for the value of the pepper, but nothing has been heard [...] {alt. Tr.: [...about buying] silver from the proceeds of the pepper, nothing prevented me [from buying]} </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the silver, except that it was expensive—five dirhems (weight)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[of silver, costing—x] dinar(s), but {alt. tr.: and} I didn’t dare to buy you this at that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[price. As for] the ‘share,’ which I charged you for the pepper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[..., I reduced] it a great deal, since the sum of all amounted to</p>

                        <p>[. . .] of the merchants… There is an agreement between me and them that of every one hundred bahārs of large measure (they receive) 95 bahārs. I incurred losses on ships in this business of pepper belonging to the merchants and on expenses for the ship’s equipment, for which I paid {alt. tr.: and for the loss of the tolls for the ship that we paid}, approximately 4,000 dinars. There has not occurred to anyone such a thing. {alt. tr.: No one ever suffered such a calamity.} And all [...]</p>

<p>[. . . May God], the Exalted, recompense and replace what has been lost! And after this </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[so-and-so] paid me 2,100 dinars for the ship, a price</p>

<p>{alt. tr.: the highest bid} absolutely [unheard of]. He did not accept this, but charged me with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[. . .I asked God], the Exalted, [for guidance and] fitted out the ship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>—the [Mubāra]k—which will sail to Mangalore under the supervision of Sheikh Abū Saʿīd b. Maḥfūẓ {lit., ‘I outfitted the ship...through the agency of Sheikh...to Mangalore’}. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>—may God ordain his {alt. tr.: its} safe arrival! I have done so dreading that [enemies]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and whoever has no good in him would gloat over my misfortune. I sent you with Sheikh </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Saʿīd b. Maḥfūẓ half a basket of dates and a piece {alt. tr.: unit} of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ros[e water] and two [rubā]ʿiyyas of sugar and raisins. Please be sure to collect this, my lord,</p>
</li>

<p>and may you think well of your servant! I shall be glad {alt. tr.: please honor me} to do any errand for you.</p>

<li>
<p>May you be granted complete well-being and the mercy of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[God, and His blessings]! And peace.</p>
</li>
<li>I sent you with Sheikh Abū Saʿīd a rubāʿiyya of soap.</li>
