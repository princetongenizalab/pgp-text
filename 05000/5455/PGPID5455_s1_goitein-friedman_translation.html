<li>
<p>The settlement with Makhlūf, the son (of the man) ‘with the gladdening eyes,’ The Orphan,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with regard to what you owed him, cost, after much discord and troubles,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>300 dinars. Saydān carried for you 100 (Egyptian) mithqāls, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>worth 424 dinars. The price of one-and-a-half</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bahārs of drky, together with the price of the basket and the exit toll was 24 ½ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price of a bowl 96 dinars. Total owed by you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>880 ½ dinars. This is your detailed account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for last year. By God, the Almighty, last year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sent on my own account, in the boat in which</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saydān traveled, (goods) the like of which I have never sent by sea. What</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>belonged to me would have taken care of all the packed wares kept back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Mangalore, so that all the cargo (of the returning ship) would have been mine,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with no one else having a share in it. But He decreed upon one (Saydān) for whom I am sorry. Most</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the cargo of the (outgoing) ship’s space was exclusively mine, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there was in the ship an unlimited amount</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of diversified goods. Never has a ship like this sailed[…]</p>
