between the boat of al-Qummī and the boat of Bihzāt. We all went out in [. . .]
10. and you most kindly came down (to the port) and bade me farewell in the boat, you and my lords, your brothers. [. . . I entered]
the land of al-Tīz, and you have heard what happened to me in al-Tīz and what led [to my arrival in Nahr-]
wāra in safety, thank God, the Exalted. I received your letter, which was sent to [Nahrwāra together with]
an amount of dinars. You asked me to buy for you two faylams and bd[. . .]
of silk, red and black wrappers, Ṭabarī cloth, and pillow cases, and if the dinars sent were not [sufficient, I should]
advance the funds needed. I bought all you ordered with my own money. [Your dinars]
I gave to Dādā, the salesman, for an additional quarter per dinar [. . . He got them back,]
after he had sued the vizier, and they are still with him [. . . I dispatched]
the goods for you and your brothers and put into them [bags with beads(?). I wrote to you,]
saying: May every one of you take what he desires, and the rest will remain for me [. . . To me belong]
also two bundles of wrappers, which I sent together with [your goods. I hope they arrive]
safely. I informed you, my lord, that I willingly [. . . On sea]
I experienced horrors, as you know, but you have also heard [that I arrived] 
in Mirbāṭ safely together with what of my goods was salvaged. I [bought you steel and]
sent it to you (pl.) from Mirbāṭ, as a replacement for your (pl.) goods [lost on my voyage. I wrote]
to you (s.), explaining my situation, and asking you to verify \\the price of all// goods [. . .]
previously mentioned, also what had been obtained for the copper in Maʿ.[. . . and the cost of the 50]
bahārs and requested you to send the 50 bahārs of [pepper . . . together]
with all the goods I had left with you [in your warehouse . . .]
to Dahlak, if you could do so; and if this is not possible, you should let [me know . . .,]
whereupon I would come and carry with me my own goods and those belonging to Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb al-Ḥakīm, [may God preserve his honored position!].
Your precious letters with messages befitting you, reached me, saying: [When your pepper will arrive]
in safety, then your merchandise will get to Dahlak even before your arrival there. I put my trust in [—God, may His name be exalted!—]
and in my lord, and sent with \\the son of// the nākhudā and the first mate [Ibn al-Dabbāgh . . .]
and 60 pieces of steel and less than 70 sieves to my lord, but lea[rned that . . .]
Ibn al-Dabbāgh . . . as my lord also knows, and the shipment perished.
