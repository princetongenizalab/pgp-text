<li>I asked my lord to grant me an advance on fifty bahārs pepper; you agr[eed and divided the amount]</li>
<li>between the boat of al-Qummī and the boat of Bihzāt. We all went out in [. . .]</li>
<li>10. and you most kindly came down (to the port) and bade me farewell in the boat, you and my lords, your brothers. [. . . I entered]</li>
<li>the land of al-Tīz, and you have heard what happened to me in al-Tīz and what led [to my arrival in Nahr-]</li>
<li>wāra in safety, thank God, the Exalted. I received your letter, which was sent to [Nahrwāra together with]</li>
<li>an amount of dinars. You asked me to buy for you two faylams and bd[. . .]</li>
<li>of silk, red and black wrappers, Ṭabarī cloth, and pillow cases, and if the dinars sent were not [sufficient, I should]</li>
<li>advance the funds needed. I bought all you ordered with my own money. [Your dinars]</li>
<li>I gave to Dādā, the salesman, for an additional quarter per dinar [. . . He got them back,]</li>
<li>after he had sued the vizier, and they are still with him [. . . I dispatched]</li>
<li>the goods for you and your brothers and put into them [bags with beads(?). I wrote to you,]</li>
<li>saying: May every one of you take what he desires, and the rest will remain for me [. . . To me belong]</li>
<li>also two bundles of wrappers, which I sent together with [your goods. I hope they arrive]</li>
<li>safely. I informed you, my lord, that I willingly [. . . On sea]</li>
<li>I experienced horrors, as you know, but you have also heard [that I arrived]&nbsp;</li>
<li>in Mirbāṭ safely together with what of my goods was salvaged. I [bought you steel and]</li>
<li>sent it to you (pl.) from Mirbāṭ, as a replacement for your (pl.) goods [lost on my voyage. I wrote]</li>
<li>to you (s.), explaining my situation, and asking you to verify \\the price of all// goods [. . .]</li>
<li>previously mentioned, also what had been obtained for the copper in Maʿ.[. . . and the cost of the 50]</li>
<li>bahārs and requested you to send the 50 bahārs of [pepper . . . together]</li>
<li>with all the goods I had left with you [in your warehouse . . .]</li>
<li>to Dahlak, if you could do so; and if this is not possible, you should let [me know . . .,]</li>
<li>whereupon I would come and carry with me my own goods and those belonging to Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb al-Ḥakīm, [may God preserve his honored position!].</li>
<li>Your precious letters with messages befitting you, reached me, saying: [When your pepper will arrive]</li>
<li>in safety, then your merchandise will get to Dahlak even before your arrival there. I put my trust in [&mdash;God, may His name be exalted!&mdash;]</li>
<li>and in my lord, and sent with \\the son of// the nākhudā and the first mate [Ibn al-Dabbāgh . . .]</li>
<li>and 60 pieces of steel and less than 70 sieves to my lord, but lea[rned that . . .]</li>
<li>Ibn al-Dabbāgh . . . as my lord also knows, and the shipment perished.</li>
