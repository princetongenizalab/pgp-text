<p>8. I asked my lord to grant me an advance on fifty bahārs pepper; you agr[eed and divided the amount]</p>
<p>9. between the boat of al-Qummī and the boat of Bihzāt. We all went out in [. . .]</p>
<p>10. and you most kindly came down (to the port) and bade me farewell in the boat, you and my lords, your brothers. [. . . I entered]</p>
<p>11. the land of al-Tīz, and you have heard what happened to me in al-Tīz and what led [to my arrival in Nahr-]</p>
<p>12. wāra in safety, thank God, the Exalted. I received your letter, which was sent to [Nahrw&ensp;ra together with]</p>
<p>13. an amount of dinars. You asked me to buy for you two faylams and bd[. . .]</p>
<p>14. of silk, red and black wrappers, Ṭabarī cloth, and pillow cases, and if the dinars sent were not [sufficient, I should]</p>
<p>15. advance the funds needed. I bought all you ordered with my own money. [Your dinars]</p>
<p>16. I gave to Dādā, the salesman, for an additional quarter per dinar [. . . He got them back,]</p>
<p>17. after he had sued the vizier, and they are still with him [. . . I dispatched]</p>
<p>18. the goods for you and your brothers and put into them [bags with beads(?). I wrote to you,]</p>
<p>19. saying: May every one of you take what he desires, and the rest will remain for me [. . . To me belong]</p>
<p>20. also two bundles of wrappers, which I sent together with [your goods. I hope they arrive]</p>
<p>21. safely. I informed you, my lord, that I willingly [. . . On sea]</p>
<p>22. I experienced horrors, as you know, but you have also heard [that I arrived]&nbsp;</p>
<p>23. &nbsp;in Mirbāṭ safely together with what of my goods was salvaged. I [bought you steel and]</p>
<p>24. sent it to you (pl.) from Mirbāṭ, as a replacement for your (pl.) goods [lost on my voyage. I wrote]</p>
<p>25. to you (s.), explaining my situation, and asking you to verify //the price of all// goods [. . .]</p>
<p>26. previously mentioned, also what had been obtained for the copper in Ma&ensp;.[. . . and the cost of the 50]</p>
<p>27. bahārs and requested you to send the 50 bah&ensp;rs of [pepper . . . together]</p>
<p>28. with all the goods I had left with you [in your warehouse . . .]</p>
<p>29. to Dahlak, if you could do so; and if this is not possible, you should let [me know . . .,]</p>
<p>30. whereupon I would come and carry with me my own goods and those belonging to Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb al-Ḥakīm, [may God preserve his honored position!].</p>
<p>31. Your precious letters with messages be&ensp;tting you, reached me, saying: [When your pepper will arrive]</p>
<p>32. in safety, then your merchandise will get to Dahlak even before your arrival there. I put my trust in [&mdash;God, may His name be exalted!&mdash;]</p>
<p>33. and in my lord, and sent with //the son of// the nākhudā and the first mate [Ibn al-Dabbāgh . . .]</p>
<p>34. and 60 pieces of steel and less than 70 sieves to my lord, but lea[rned that . . .]</p>
<p>35. Ibn al-Dabbāgh . . . as my lord also knows, and the shipment perished.</p>
