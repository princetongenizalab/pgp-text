                        <ol>
<li>In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>Previously, a letter had been sent by me //to your noble excellency//&mdash;may God lengthen the life of my lord, the illustrious Sheikh</li>
<li>Abū ʿAlī, my master and lord Japheth,&nbsp;the esteemed and honored elder,</li>
<li>the Leader of the Congregations, may He always support, elevate, and strengthen you,&nbsp;</li>
<li>and crush your enemies! The content of that letter, after you will have taken cognizance of it, relieves me</li>
<li>from repeating its details here.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is difficult for me to describe to you&mdash;may God protect your honored position!&mdash;</li>
<li>the bickering and quarrels I have had to endure from Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb al-Ḥakīm</li>
<li>with regard to the goods I had carried with me for him, the choice part of which I left</li>
<li>with my lord; namely, the small pieces of silver,</li>
<li>seven in number, whose weights were indicated by al-Ḥakīm</li>
<li>(as mentioned) in my previous letter; [[and the bag of copper]] the bale of lichen,</li>
<li>weighing 400 manns; the bag of copper&mdash;</li>
<li>110 pounds;</li>
<li>dodder of thyme&mdash;</li>
<li>10 manns; all according to him, and a small container with scammony. What took place</li>
<li>between him and me your excellency is too illustrious to hear. However</li>
<li>those who will arrive from here at your place&mdash;may God make your honored position permanent!&mdash;will tell you what</li>
<li>happened.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto - right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I have granted him an advance&nbsp;of 100 dinars for these goods until their proceeds arrive. But after these settlements</li>
<li>had been reached between us, we both turned to arguments and wrangling until</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto - top</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>it led to lawsuits. Finally, upright</li>
<li>elders intervened, suggesting several matters {add: details of which will follow} according to which today [[the . . .]] an agreement was reached</li>
