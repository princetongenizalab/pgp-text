<li>In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>Previously, a letter had been sent by me \\to your noble excellency//&mdash;may God lengthen the life of my lord, the illustrious Sheikh</li>
<li>Abū ʿAlī, my master and lord Japheth,&nbsp;the esteemed and honored elder,</li>
<li>the Leader of the Congregations, may He always support, elevate, and strengthen you,&nbsp;</li>
<li>and crush your enemies! The content of that letter, after you will have taken cognizance of it, relieves me</li>
<li>from repeating its details here.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is difficult for me to describe to you&mdash;may God protect your honored position!&mdash;</li>
<li>the bickering and quarrels I have had to endure from Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb al-Ḥakīm</li>
<li>with regard to the goods I had carried with me for him, the choice part of which I left</li>
<li>with my lord; namely, the small pieces of silver,</li>
<li>seven in number, whose weights were indicated by al-Ḥakīm</li>
<li>(as mentioned) in my previous letter; [[and the bag of copper]] the bale of lichen,</li>
<li>weighing 400 manns; the bag of copper&mdash;</li>
<li>110 pounds;</li>
<li>dodder of thyme&mdash;</li>
<li>10 manns; all according to him, and a small container with scammony. What took place</li>
<li>between him and me your excellency is too illustrious to hear. However</li>
<li>those who will arrive from here at your place&mdash;may God make your honored position permanent!&mdash;will tell you what</li>
<li>happened.</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>I have granted him an advance&nbsp;of 100 dinars for these goods until their proceeds arrive. But after these settlements</li>
<li>had been reached between us, we both turned to arguments and wrangling until</li>

<li>elders intervened, suggesting several matters {add: details of which will follow} according to which today ⟦the . . .⟧ an agreement was reached</li>

<li>to the effect that I should write to your excellency, my lord, the sheikh, as follows: Please list</li>
<li>all the proceeds from the aforementioned goods</li>
<li>belonging to Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb the Doctor, including</li>
<li>what was salvaged of the 50 bahārs (of pepper), on the payment of which</li>
<li>my lord had given me respite {alt. tr.: against which you, my lord, had given me an advance}, for I had assigned to him in my heart</li>
<li>15 bahārs out of these. My lord, do me a favor.</li>
<li>List all this. From the total,</li>
<li>deduct all that is mine, namely 100 good</li>
<li>Egyptian dinars, in return for the 100 dinars which I advanced him</li>
<li>here &lt;&lt;(right margin)&gt;&gt; and hand over the balance to your representative.</li>
<li>Please oblige me in this matter, as is your usual good practice with me</li>
<li>at all times. I know well that I am causing</li>
<li>your excellency much trouble and feel very bad about this {lit., &lsquo;trouble and am disturbing you with this&rsquo;}. But</li>
<li>it is not my fault. I am forced to do so.</li>
<li>The account to be handed over to your representative</li>
<li>should be made out as {alt. tr.: When your representative collects, what he is to collect, it should be registered in} a deposition in court in the assembly of the elders and signed by</li>
<li>them.I wish to inform you also that it was established in court</li>
<li>that, of the proceeds (from the Doctor&rsquo;s goods) in your hands, my lord, 100 dinars</li>
<li>plus the 11&frac12; dinars paid by me for {alt. tr.: if the sum . . . equals an amount of 100 dinars and the 11&frac12; dinars, the remainder of} the copper, transport expenses</li>
<li>of three dinars, and five dinars for each of the 15 bahārs of pepper, are {alt. tr.: it is} mine.</li>
<li>All that is above that total is his; all that is less is mine {alt. tr.: If it is more, the excess belongs to him; and if it is less, it is mine}; he is not responsible for it.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Even if everything perishes, it is not his loss, and he is also not obliged to return the 100</li>
<li>advanced to him. \\This is stated expressly in the record of the court.// Now, my lord, exercise your usual circumspection</li>
<li>in this entire matter&mdash;may I never be deprived of you and never miss your favors!</li>
<li>May I ask your excellency to examine&mdash;with the enlightenment of God, the Exalted&mdash;the case of the 50</li>
<li>bahārs of pepper and to divide the proceeds from what has remained of them between me</li>
<li>and him (Abū Yaʿqūb) in accordance with our shares in them, namely, 35 (were bought) for me</li>
<li>and 15 for him. What has remained {lit., &lsquo;salvaged of them&rsquo;} should be divided proportionally.</li>
<li>Please explain {alt. tr.: describe} everything in detail. Also:</li>
<li>the proceeds from the btrwh (cast) copper belong to Sheikh Abū Yaʿqūb</li>
<li>not to me. Clarify this and copy for your representative all</li>
<li>the assets noted in your account book in favor of the aforementioned, and have it certi&ensp;ed after</li>
<li>deducting the expenses for customs and commissions. And buy me goods for the 100</li>
<li>dinars and send them with whomever you choose, however you deem fit,</li>
<li>⟦for I⟧, and make an effort that the goods for 100 dinars be</li>
<li>either pepper or lac, whatever you regard (as more pro table), and inform about this&mdash;</li>
<li>I mean, at the time you send them&mdash;some of our coreligionists and not&nbsp;</li>
<li>less than two. And Peace.</li>
