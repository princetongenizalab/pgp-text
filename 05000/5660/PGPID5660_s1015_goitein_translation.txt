Recto
My elder and master, may God prolong your life and make your welfare and happiness permanent. May he augment his bounty and spiritual gifts granted to you. 
I am writing you from Palermo on the 6th of Tishri, may God make this a blessed year for me and for you and for all Israel. 
What you wish to know: I was shipwrecked in Zahlaq, between Surt (Syrta, Sirte) and Hawwāra (Lebda?), and came out of it without a dinar or even a dirhem and no garment to wear; I arrived naked in Tripoli. By God, had I not met there a Jew who owed me a qinṭār of wax (sent to him) from Zawīla and with whom I agreed on a price of 5 dinars, which I received from him and with which I bought clothing and provisions, I would have been destroyed and forced to have recourse to philanthropy.
Arriving in Palermo, I found that a man from Barqa had pulled down my small house and built there another. I quarrel with him, but, by God, I have no dinar or even a dirhem to spend (on a lawsuit). Then I did not find my brother here so that I could not get from him part of what he owes me. 
I sent you ten pounds of silk with Ḥayyīm b. Sa‘āda and sent you also 6 dinars gold, numbering 6 ¼ . With you I left 2 dinars and with them in the house 1 dinar and the olive oil I bought from you. As you know, 10 dinars are due the girl as her second installment (of her marriage portion). I wrote her a bill of divorce fearing the vicissitudes of fate, nor do I know whether I shall be able to return to them in the course of two or even three years, for this town is menaced by enemy attack, and, at present, I do not have a thing. 
I left with you promissory notes: of the Son of the Swollen Woman  6 ½  dinars; Isaac Qābisī — 1 ½  dinars; Ḥayyīm Ibn Jāsūs- three qinṭārs of tragacanth gum; all this besides what is owed me by Muslims. Collect these debts and keep the proceeds for the alimony of the boy. If she accepts the divorce, I shall send every year the alimony for the boy. But if she prefers not to accept the divorce, deal with this matter cautiously in a way deserving my thanks: ask her whether she is prepared to settle with me in Sicily. (In case she does), let her confirm this by oath and inform me accordingly. I shall then sell my apartment and bring her here together with my boy. By God, I did not write her the bill of divorce, because I do not love her, but because I was afraid of the punishment of the Creator.
And, oh God, oh God, my lord, the little boy! Concern yourself with him in accordance with your [religiosity], so well known to me. When he becomes stronger, let him pass his time with a teacher. I shall write to you and i[nform you about my situation]. By God, at this moment I have nothing, [...]. But as soon as [...] .
