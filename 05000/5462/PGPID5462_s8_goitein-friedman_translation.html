<p>Your two servants took note of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what you had described in your distinguished letter about sending a power of attorney against that Jew.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By Great God and the covenant of the living God, your two servants were overwhelmed </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with boundless joy by your having kindly honored </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>them with filling your need. We were prepared to perform this act of respect for you </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and apply ourselves to realize your right and collect your due, in the most complete </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and proper fashion possible. The two of us inquired about that Jew with our coreligionists, the Jews who have arrived (fromEgypt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They said that he had returned to Egypt (or Fustat: Misr) from {Aydhāb. Certainly our bad luck caused </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this [. . .] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We hope that your excellency will find a substitute, God willing, and God return to you your belongings.}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your eminent excellency mentioned sending three wraps4 and a scarf. May God reward you well [for]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this and undertake to give you recompense! [...] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your two servants thanked you for [your k]ind[ness]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your effort over this. May we never want for you, God willing! Your excellency—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God make &lt;your honored position&gt; permanent!— mentioned that we had had a credit for the proceeds from all the small items we had sent—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after the expenditures for customs, tolls and the like—of 117 ⁄ 8 Egyptian dinars. There is nothing to say7 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>concerning this, except that the wraps were not commensurate with what your two servants had suggested (ordered), </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor were they appropriate8 for them. Your two servants had rather ordered something more delicate (or: exquisite)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and beautiful than that. There are plenty like that brought by the travelers who arrive (from Egypt). We hope that your excellency will kindly find </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a substitute. As to the balance of the account, of which your eminent excellency wrote that </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you had sent them in payment, there is nothing to say. If there is still some (balance) left, kindly send </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for it to your two servants fine yellow and red strings (wires), Egyptian handicraft, fine, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good work, if you will be so kind. Some time ago your late father—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God’s mercy be on him!—had sent to us what was most exquisite, fine and superb. Be so kind as to do this. May we never want for you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But as for us, your two servants had sent with the most eminent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sheikh Abū {Alī b. Wahab the Fellow (of the Yeshiva) something for your father, namely a piece </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of delicate Indian red silk (lānas) and a head cover (ardī ) of delicate Indian red silk and, I think, one or two pairs of Aththarī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shoes made of unscraped skins. The details are in our letter there; please look for it. </p>
