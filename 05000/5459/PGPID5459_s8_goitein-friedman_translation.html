<li>
<p>In the name of the Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lt;&lt;[Margin (20)] The servant Maḍmūn b. David—may the spirit of God grant him rest!&gt;&gt; greets his high and lofty excellency . . .</p>
</li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>

<li>
<p>I received</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your distinguished letter in which you report the trouble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you encountered with the pepper carried with you. God, the Exalted, knows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that my intention in this matter was only to be useful to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God, the Exalted, support you and grant you success! Amen, Amen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I should like you to share this with your servant {lit., ‘What the servant has to share with him [= you] includes the following:’}: The troops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>killed al-Malik al-Muʿizz, who had claimed to be caliph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is succeeded by al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ayyūb, the son of the Sultan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sayf al-Islam, and his Atabeg is the Sultan Sayf al-Dīn Sunqur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After his government had been settled, your servants submitted your case to him. {Alt. tr.: After his government had been settled, your servants submitted their case to him.}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He referred it to the administrative court. But your servants {Alt. tr.: He related to them with equitable justice. Your servants}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>declared that this was a case belonging to the religious court. {Alt. tr.: openly proclaimed their acceptance of the religion (Judaism).} We obfuscated the matter before the divines {alt. tr.: put on the badge}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and paid the poll tax. All this happened in the month of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sivan, one day before the eve of Pentecost. We celebrated the feast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the proper way, in happiness and joy. Some Jew-baiters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>formed menacing groups, but could not do a thing, thank God,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Exalted. All that happened to us has come through the blessings of </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our lord, the Rayyis Moses—may memory of the righteous be for a blessing!—and the blessings of our lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pious man, our master Isaac, and through your blessings. May God, the Exalted,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grant you good reward for your munificence {alt. tr.: courage, virtue}! Your distinguished</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>letter, containing several orders {lit., ‘instructions to your servant for many things’} has arrived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your servant hopes to be able to carry them out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not doubt that you—may God make your honored position eternal!—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love me and are concerned with my well-being. May God, the Exalted, help me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to satisfy your wishes, as is my duty, God willing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I renew my reliance on you for having the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two pieces {alt. tr.: items} sent with you co[llated]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and {add: please have} a third copy made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in good script and on fine paper. And have copied</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for me the medical writings of my lord the Rayyis.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>And buy for me any fine copies of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>useful books you can lay your hands on and kindly send them to me. {Add: May God make your honored position eternal!}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May I never be deprived of you and never miss you!</p>

<li>The servant Maḍmūn b. Jacob&mdash;may the spirit of God</li>
<li>grant him rest!&mdash;present at the writing of this letter, sends his</li>
<li>
<p>best regards to his excellency, my master. Thanks to [God...],</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the affair ended happily. May all Israel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be blessed with the sudden appearance of salvation! We were not worthy of this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but the Holy One &mdash;may He be blessed!&mdash;did what He is worthy of, for the sake of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His great name, and brought relief to the Jews in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the entire country of Yemen. Relief was brought first, slightly before us,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the people of the mountains. Finally the Sultan came to us,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the relief became complete, by the help of God {read: the Creator } and through your</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>success. Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kindest regards to his excellency my lord (= to you) and to all under his care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the kindest regards, and to all connected with him and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subordinated to him a million greetings of peace.</p>

<p>Salvation is near!</p>

<p>Two copies were made and sent by way of the Ḥijāz.</p>
