<li>To my dear brother—may God give you long life, protect you and guard you,</li>
<li>not deny you His superior gift of success, be for you a guardian and protector</li>
<li>in all your affairs, avert from you anything that troubles you and keep away whatever</li>
<li>distresses you! This is to inform you—may God give you life!—that your esteemed letter </li>
<li>arrived on the 24th of Tammuz. You blame me in it for</li>
<li>not having responded to your letters. My brother, did I not</li>
<li>send you, a pair of detailed letters concerning my circumstances and what I</li>
<li>endured? This was good for me, because the boats did not get through,</li>
<li>and the boat from which we disembarked is held up at al-Kanāʾis.</li>
<li>Why, my brother, do you cause my heart pain and distress me more, by saying</li>
<li>to me, “You care little about me”? The moment I heard these words</li>
<li>I almost expired. I swear by these lines that what caused me</li>
<li>to delay (or: withhold) my letters to you was only my compassion for you and because of what you said</li>
<li>about sending my letters with Sheikh Abū Naṣr. I am not</li>
<li>able to travel to the Square of the Perfumers, because I am afraid of</li>
<li>the (tax) office. The ‘ralliers’ took 13 dirhems.</li>
<li>I am staying with a Jewish man, whose acquaintance I made</li>
<li>ten days after my disembarking from the boat, because from the day I disembarked I worked</li>
<li>at the place of an Ishmaelite. As soon as he realized that I was a Jew, he would not let me work</li>
<li>at his place. So I started (working) at the place of that Jew in a house adjoining the</li>
<li>synagogue. I work on the loom. This keeps me impoverished, every day</li>
<li>two and a half dirhems! But I realized the 13 dirhems. As to</li>

                        <p>For your noble self best greetings, and for whoever is embraced by your care best greetings, first and foremost the two esteemed brothers, they and their children. May the God of Israel bless them, guard them and keep them! May He fulfill in them the verse “Your sons will succeed your ancestors”! I greet them with the best, </p>

<li>the lac, no one is buying or selling (it) in the city. There has arrived a ship</li>
<li>from Dāniya, which had in it all commodities, including silk, mercury and tin.</li>
<li>I believe that maybe it will sell to newcomers. I shall leave it with Sheikh Abū Naṣr</li>
<li>and come, God willing, with Ibn Bārūkh and Ibn Shabrūṭ. If you</li>
<li>inform me of any request that fits your needs, I’ll buy it for you. You</li>
<li>did not write me in detail about your situation, and you left me anxious about it.</li>
<li>Please (send) a detailed letter. May your well-being increase forever! Amen neṣaḥ</li>
<li>selah. May they bestow on you well-being! This letter was written on the </li>
<li>27th of the month of Tammuz. May salvation be near! </li>
