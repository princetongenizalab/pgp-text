<li>To my dear brother—may God give you long life, protect you and guard you,</li>
<li>not deny you His superior gift of success, be for you a guardian and protector</li>
<li>in all your affairs, avert from you anything that troubles you and keep away whatever</li>
<li>distresses you! This is to inform you—may God give you life!—that your esteemed letter </li>
<li>arrived on the 24th of Tammuz. You blame me in it for</li>
<li>not having responded to your letters. My brother, did I not</li>
<li>send you, a pair of detailed letters concerning my circumstances and what I</li>
<li>endured? This was good for me, because the boats did not get through,</li>
<li>and the boat from which we disembarked is held up at al-Kanāʾis.</li>
<li>Why, my brother, do you cause my heart pain and distress me more, by saying</li>
<li>to me, “You care little about me”? The moment I heard these words</li>
<li>I almost expired. I swear by these lines that what caused me</li>
<li>to delay (or: withhold) my letters to you was only my compassion for you and because of what you said</li>
<li>about sending my letters with Sheikh Abū Naṣr. I am not</li>
<li>able to travel to the Square of the Perfumers, because I am afraid of</li>
<li>the (tax) office. The ‘ralliers’ took 13 dirhems.</li>
<li>I am staying with a Jewish man, whose acquaintance I made</li>
<li>ten days after my disembarking from the boat, because from the day I disembarked I worked</li>
<li>at the place of an Ishmaelite. As soon as he realized that I was a Jew, he would not let me work</li>
<li>at his place. So I started (working) at the place of that Jew in a house adjoining the</li>
<li>synagogue. I work on the loom. This keeps me impoverished, every day</li>
<li>two and a half dirhems! But I realized the 13 dirhems. As to</li>
