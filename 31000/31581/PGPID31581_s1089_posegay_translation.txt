Rejoice, my beloved friends and family, and every dear friend who may bring me joy!
The time of our wedding festivities has drawn near, and the sweetness of my celebration is the presence of my beloveds;
a wish that they be present and honoured in attendance. You are all my desire, and forever my treasure.

 

The ceremony is Friday, June 10th, 1881 at 3 p.m.,
and a picture on Saturday in the holy community of the Egyptians, ending with you all in delight.
