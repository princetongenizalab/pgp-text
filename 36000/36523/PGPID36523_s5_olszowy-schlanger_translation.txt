This is a deed of the betrothal of Abūʾl Ḥasan Daʾūd ben al-Faraj ʿImrān al-Levi ha-Kohen, the Jew, with the mohar reaching five hundred dinars. Two hundred from them are the advanced payment, 
and three hundred the delayed payment. In addition, fifty dirhems. And the betrothal was necessarily carried out according to the conditions of the Karaites–with the advanced mohar, and the agent for this [was] 
her father, the elder Abi'l Faḍl, and the two witnesses of her willing appointment of her father were the exquisite scholar, and Abūʾl Ḥasan ben al-Jabāwī [?]. 
And this took place on Wednesday evening, on the fifteenth of the month Av, which is Av for the majority of the Karaites 
and which is Elūl for some of them, and which is the month of Shaaban of the Gentiles, of the year one thousand three hundred forty four 
of the era of Alexander.
