[In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate]
[May God prolong] his existence, preserve his support, glory, strength, and safety,
 expressing gratitude to God Almighty and to him (the addressee). When the tax was received, it was four dinars, and it was from God Almighty and through him. The slave weighed them and bears witness to God,
 from it are eighty-six dirhams as payment for Karar (?), the Turk, between Abu al-Dhar and the Abu al-Faḍl the elder. And the remaining seventy-four [dirhams]
we sent them in these twenty days, except that his eminence, may God preserve his glory, had promised his slave,
at the hands of Abū Yaʿqūb Isḥaq, who wrote the letters to Ṣafī al-Dawla bin Bulus(?), and to Alexandria.
He asks and implores for its approval and the removal of the slave from the city, for his situation // the people // like this man, is unfortunate (?) may he bring what
will help him return, and cover him from what he is facing. If he remains in this town without a livelihood, he won't find anything to sustain himself;
the slave will perish, and the ones around him will also perish, and perhaps difficulties will surround him and all his associates. Therefore, please expedite the writing of letters for his departure
to what God wills or a livelihood through which he can spend his time. He is in difficulty that [only God Almighty knows, and nothing is his power
except for supplication and gratitude, so that God Almighty may respond in the slave the best of prayers, [God willing] by his mercy,
and to him may God [protect] his glory belongs the lofty resolution regarding this, God willing.
Praise be to God alone,  [and blessings] upon his chosen servants.
