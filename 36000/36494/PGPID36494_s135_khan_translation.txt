[... upon our master and lord the ’imām al-Mus]tanṣir bi-Allāh, commander of the faithful [and upon]


his pure ancestors. The slave of our master, the blessings of God be upon him, reports to


the pure presence that he is enduring detention in the arsenal and that


he has received due punishment. He requests a kindness and benefaction


to be done to him by being charitable, in consideration of this, to his family, his children and his


crippled mother, who have stood ransom for him. To our master, the blessings of God be upon him, belongs the exalted opinion regarding that, if God wills.


Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, his prophet, and his pure family and save them.
