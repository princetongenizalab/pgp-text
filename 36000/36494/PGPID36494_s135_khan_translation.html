<p>[... upon our master and lord the &rsquo;imām al-Mus]tanṣir bi-Allāh, commander of the faithful [and upon]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his pure ancestors. The slave of our master, the blessings of God be upon him,&nbsp;reports to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pure presence that he is enduring detention in the arsenal and that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he has received due punishment. He requests a kindness and benefaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be done to him by being charitable, in consideration of this, to his family, his&nbsp;children and his</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>crippled mother, who have stood ransom for him. To our master, the blessings of&nbsp;God be upon him, belongs the exalted opinion regarding that, if God wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, his&nbsp;prophet, and his pure family and save them.</p>
