                        <p>On the same day, Mr. ʿUlla ha-Levi, son of Joseph, presented Mr. David, son of the late judge Ya'ir, to the court, and the latter witnessed for the former that he was in the synagogue on Wednesday, the tenth of this month, when Karīma, the daughter of &lsquo;Ammār, known as Wuhsha, the broker, appeared in the synagogue and said to him and to Moses, the melammēd (teacher), and to Ma'ālī, ha-Kohen, the brother of the sexton: I want to see the dayyān (judge), for I was informed that he summoned me. Now, for what reason did he do this to me? One of those present answered her: Because ʿUlla ha-Levi appealed against you to the President of the Court, wherefore he sent after you, asking you to appear with him (ʿUlla) before the Court, but you refrained from appearing with him in the Court, and thus you deserved a public notification and warning. Said she&mdash;and I heard it&mdash;: 'What do I owe to Mr. ʿUlla that he should make such a claim against me? All that is due to him from me is five qīrāṭs. For five qīrāṭs he makes such a fuss.' At the same time, also Ma'ālī ha-Kohen, the brother of the sexton, was present, and made the same deposition as the aforementioned David.</p>
