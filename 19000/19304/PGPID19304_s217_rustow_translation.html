                        <ol>
<li>Her slave Yaḥyā b. al-Ḥasan from the district of &lt;scribe has omitted place name&gt;:</li>
<li>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform our mistress, the lady—may God make her dominion eternal and strengthen her loftiness in the permanence of our master and lord</li>
<li>the imam al-Ẓāhir li-iʿzāz dīn Allāh, Commander of the Faithful, the prayers of God be upon him and his pure</li>
<li>fathers—that I am in distress and need due to shortage of food and fodder for the donkey, and that</li>
<li>each day I require bread and fodder for my riding animal in the amount of thirty dirhams per night. And when</li>
<li>I had endured this (shortage) for (too) long, I convinced my son to help.</li>
<li>I gave him one hundred dīnārs and sent him to Madīnat al-Fayyūm to buy wheat or barley there for us to eat.</li>
<li>Then the news reached me that he had bought with them (the hundred dīnārs) seventy sacks of wheat and given them over</li>
<li>to my lord the amīr Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan b. Thiqat al-Dawla, may God prolong his power. I</li>
<li>am asking our lady—may God make her dominion eternal and strengthen her power—to send a eunuch</li>
<li>to the district governor to take a decree from him releasing them (the sacks of wheat) as soon as they reach Giza.</li>
<li>If he holds it up from me (the permission to release the sacks of wheat), the toil of her servant my son will be in vain, and I will return to</li>
<li>the support of our lady, since our household has so many dependents that were she to see them,</li>
<li>she would have compassion toward them (and relieve their suffering). Were it not for the oppression of misery, I would not have imposed upon our lady</li>
<li>in any way, even though her magnanimity does not weigh heavily on me at all, since she is characterized</li>
<li>by magnanimity and abundant benefaction and manifest kindness.</li>
<li>And to our gracious mistress belongs the lofty resolution in answering her servant in what he has requested.</li>
<li>[Praise be to God, the only, and his prayers and pe]a[c]e [upon our lord Muḥ ammad.]</li>
