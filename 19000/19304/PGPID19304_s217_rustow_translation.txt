Recto

Her slave Yaḥyā b. al-Ḥasan from the district of <scribe has omitted place name>:
In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.
I inform our mistress, the lady—may God make her dominion eternal and strengthen her loftiness in the permanence of our master and lord
the imam al-Ẓāhir li-iʿzāz dīn Allāh, Commander of the Faithful, the prayers of God be upon him and his pure
fathers—that I am in distress and need due to shortage of food and fodder for the donkey, and that
each day I require bread and fodder for my riding animal in the amount of thirty dirhams per night. And when
I had endured this (shortage) for (too) long, I convinced my son to help.
I gave him one hundred dīnārs and sent him to Madīnat al-Fayyūm to buy wheat or barley there for us to eat.
Then the news reached me that he had bought with them (the hundred dīnārs) seventy sacks of wheat and given them over
to my lord the amīr Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan b. Thiqat al-Dawla, may God prolong his power. I
am asking our lady—may God make her dominion eternal and strengthen her power—to send a eunuch
to the district governor to take a decree from him releasing them (the sacks of wheat) as soon as they reach Giza.
If he holds it up from me (the permission to release the sacks of wheat), the toil of her servant my son will be in vain, and I will return to
the support of our lady, since our household has so many dependents that were she to see them,
she would have compassion toward them (and relieve their suffering). Were it not for the oppression of misery, I would not have imposed upon our lady
in any way, even though her magnanimity does not weigh heavily on me at all, since she is characterized
by magnanimity and abundant benefaction and manifest kindness.
And to our gracious mistress belongs the lofty resolution in answering her servant in what he has requested.
[Praise be to God, the only, and his prayers and pe]a[c]e [upon our lord Muḥ ammad.]
