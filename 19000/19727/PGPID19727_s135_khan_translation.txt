Recto

What do the masters, the jurisprudents, the 'imāms of the religion and guides of  the Muslims, say  
regarding a Jewish eye-doctor, without a beard,  
concerning whom Muslim certified witnesses have borne testimony that he is  trusted in the practice of his profession to visit  
the family of Muslims. Is he permitted to do this, having received a testimony to 
that effect, or not? Grant us your decision, may God have mercy upon you.
