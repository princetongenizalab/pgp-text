<li>What do the masters, the jurisprudents, the 'imƒÅms of the religion and guides of&nbsp; the Muslims, say&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>regarding a Jewish eye-doctor, without a beard,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>concerning whom Muslim certified witnesses have borne testimony that he is&nbsp; trusted in the practice of his profession to visit&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the family of Muslims. Is he permitted to do this, having received a testimony to&nbsp;</li>
<li>that effect, or not? Grant us your decision, may God have mercy upon you.&nbsp;</li>
