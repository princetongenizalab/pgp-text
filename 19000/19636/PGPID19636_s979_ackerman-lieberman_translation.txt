Abū al-Surūr Peraḥya b. Tiq[va] known as (I)bn al-Am‘aṭ came before us—we, the  court—  and in his hand were five dina(rs). He said that they were from the sum total  of the document which was a partnership (shirka) between Abū Naṣr b. Khalaf and Abū al-Ḥasan  b. Abū al-Waḥsh. He demanded that he have the right of disposal therein.  His excellency our lord, “Israel’s chariots and horsemen”, demanded of him one who  would stand guarantor for this  amount. He left and summoned the Elder Abū Sahl al-Tājir  ha-Levi b. master Joseph ha-Levi b. Job (who) r(ests in) E(den), and he guaranteed this  amount  in his possession for his excellency our lord. On the date which […]which was the month of Adar 1471, two Jewish witnesses came—they were the ElderAbū al-Munajjā al-Kohen b. the Elder Abū al-Wafā al-Kohen, and the Elder Abū alḤasan b. the Elder Abū al-Waḥash Sibā‘. They testified before us—we, the court—that the two of them knew //and they set out to clarify the claims concerning the account  of [what he had pa]id with his partner// that this … the [afore]mentioned fromthe sum total of the obligation … // … that which is from their reckoning … the sum  total of the obligation// was a partnership (shirka) between Abū Naṣr and Abū al-Ḥasan.It is from the total therein. When we heard their aforementioned testimony thusthe aforementioned was mentioned concerning this Abū Sahl ha-Levi, all of the  aforementioned five  dina(rs) which he guaranteed, and he allocated for Abū Surūr therein,from the sum total of the aforementioned obligation. And we wrote and signed  concerning what was before us.  Hillel b. master Zadoq Av Bet Din (may the) m(emory of the) h(oly be) f(or a blessing)Nathan b.
