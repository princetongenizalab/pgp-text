                        <ol><li>Abū al-Surūr Peraḥya b. Tiq[va] known as (I)bn al-Am‘aṭ came before us—we, the  court—  </li><li>and in his hand were five dina(rs). He said that they were from the sum total  </li><li>of the document which was a partnership (shirka) between Abū Naṣr b. Khalaf and Abū al-Ḥasan  </li><li>b. Abū al-Waḥsh. He demanded that he have the right of disposal therein.  </li><li>His excellency our lord, “Israel’s chariots and horsemen”, demanded of him one who  would stand guarantor for this  </li><li>amount. He left and summoned the Elder Abū Sahl al-Tājir  </li><li>ha-Levi b. master Joseph ha-Levi b. Job (who) r(ests in) E(den), and he guaranteed this  amount  </li><li>in his possession for his excellency our lord. On the date which […]</li><li>which was the month of Adar 1471, two Jewish witnesses came—they were the Elder</li><li>Abū al-Munajjā al-Kohen b. the Elder Abū al-Wafā al-Kohen, and the Elder Abū al</li><li>Ḥasan b. the Elder Abū al-Waḥash Sibā‘. They testified before us—we, the court—</li><li>that the two of them knew //and they set out to clarify the claims concerning the account  of [what he had pa]id with his partner// that this … the [afore]mentioned from</li><li>the sum total of the obligation … // … that which is from their reckoning … the sum  total of the obligation// was a partnership (shirka) between Abū Naṣr and Abū al-Ḥasan.</li><li>It is from the total therein. When we heard their aforementioned testimony thus</li><li>the aforementioned was mentioned concerning this Abū Sahl ha-Levi, all of the  aforementioned five  </li><li>dina(rs) which he guaranteed, and he allocated for Abū Surūr therein,</li><li>from the sum total of the aforementioned obligation. And we wrote and signed  concerning what was before us.  </li><li>Hillel b. master Zadoq Av Bet Din (may the) m(emory of the) h(oly be) f(or a blessing)</li><li>Nathan b. Samuel the Ḥaver (may the) m(emory of the) h(oly be) f(or a blessing)  </li></ol>
