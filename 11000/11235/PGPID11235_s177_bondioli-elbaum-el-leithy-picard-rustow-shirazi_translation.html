<li>                                                   His servant</li>
<li>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.</li>
<li>Today — may God prolong the life of my lord the lofty shaykh</li>
<li>and make his glory, loftiness and wellbeing eternal and crush those who envy him and his enemies — </li>
<li>I don’t have much time, as I’m sitting in the study session of Ibn Ṣāʿ. That’s </li>
<li>what’s prevented me from appearing before his exalted presence.    I kiss his hand</li>
<li>and request that he send (a letter) to the scribe of my lord the governor ʿAzīz al-Dawla — may God perpetuate his support —</li>
<li>(asking him) to take a document from him (the governor) to the protector of Minyat al-Shammās, Bishop Binyāmīn</li>
<li>of Ṭamwa — may God be his support — from the compound containing the property of two monasteries, Shahrān and Ḥulwān,</li>
<li>strengthening his (the bishop’s) hand and (asking him to get) a (second) document from his master, my lord the governor ʿAzīz al-Dawla —</li>
<li>may God make his well-being eternal — to the deputy of the monastery of Shahrān [strengthening]</li>
<li>the hand of the aforementioned bishop, and a request (to know) who holds the property </li>
<li>of the two monasteries.   May God answer the pious prayers for my lord</li>
<li>of this bishop and all the monks …</li>
