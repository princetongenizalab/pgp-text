                                                   His servant
In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.
Today — may God prolong the life of my lord the lofty shaykh
and make his glory, loftiness and wellbeing eternal and crush those who envy him and his enemies — 
I don’t have much time, as I’m sitting in the study session of Ibn Ṣāʿ. That’s 
what’s prevented me from appearing before his exalted presence.    I kiss his hand
and request that he send (a letter) to the scribe of my lord the governor ʿAzīz al-Dawla — may God perpetuate his support —
(asking him) to take a document from him (the governor) to the protector of Minyat al-Shammās, Bishop Binyāmīn
of Ṭamwa — may God be his support — from the compound containing the property of two monasteries, Shahrān and Ḥulwān,
strengthening his (the bishop’s) hand and (asking him to get) a (second) document from his master, my lord the governor ʿAzīz al-Dawla —
may God make his well-being eternal — to the deputy of the monastery of Shahrān [strengthening]
the hand of the aforementioned bishop, and a request (to know) who holds the property 
of the two monasteries.   May God answer the pious prayers for my lord
of this bishop and all the monks …
