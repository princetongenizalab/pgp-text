In the name of God, most merciful and benevolent


I inform my master, the illustrious Amīr


may God perpetuate his glory


I report to you regarding


the shipment of wood which has arrived


at Ṣināʿt al-Maḥrūsa (the port of Fusṭāṭ)


its continued existence is because of my Master al-Afḍal [b. Badr al-Jamālī or al-Afḍal Kutayfāt b. al-Afḍal b. Badr al-Jamālī]


may God make his existence eternal and perpetuate his reign


I have heard that there was a delay in this shipment,


 I am sorry for this delay, it is not my habit, 


 I request your eminence to hold off Ibn Tabbān and tell him to sit


 until a fiscal officer/labourer is available in


 ……this will reap manifold profits for you, 


 God willing
