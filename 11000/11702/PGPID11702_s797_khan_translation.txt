Recto


The servant and slave 


Manṣūr ibn Ṣadaqa from the people of Sandiyūn.


In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate. 


The blessings and benedictions of God and his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings upon our lord and master the imām al-Āmir 


bi-Aḥkām Allāh, commander of the faithful, and upon his pure ancestors and his noble sons. The slave kisses the ground


before the most noble presence, may God double his lights and exalt his beacon, and reports that mercy and compassion have embraced


everyone and that the father of the slave has been silent in the countryside in Maḥallat Salīm ibn Sahl and has left his hometown. The slave 


has a house enclosure in the district known as Sandiyūn, in the province of al-Muzāḥamiyya, that used to belong to his mother. She has died, and the slave is her heir. He asks 


He has lived there continuously, and no one has more right to it than he. He therefore humbly asks the all-embracing mercies and generous kindnesses for a noble rescript (to be written) on the back of his petition to the qāḍī al-muwaffaq 


with  jurisdiction over al-Maḥalla and the surrounding region, with a copy to be deposited in his (the petitioner’s) hand, instructing him to register it the slave’s property in the manner in which property is registered with him as valid, 


thus conveying his right to him, so that he may live in these splendid days,


as a benefaction and a favor to him. To our lord, God’s blessings be upon him, belongs the exalted opinion in this matter, if God wills.


Praise be to God alone, and his blessings and peace upon our lord Muḥammad, our prophet, and his family.
