<p>The servant and slave&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manṣūr ibn Ṣadaqa from the people of Sandiyūn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The blessings and benedictions of God and his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings upon our lord and master the imām al-Āmir&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bi-Aḥkām Allāh, commander of the faithful, and upon his pure ancestors and his noble sons. The slave kisses the ground</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>before the most noble presence, may God double his lights and exalt his beacon, and reports that mercy and compassion have embraced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everyone and that the father of the slave has been silent in the countryside in Maḥallat Salīm ibn Sahl and has left his hometown. The slave&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has a house enclosure in the district known as Sandiyūn, in the province of al-Muzāḥamiyya, that used to belong to his mother. She has died, and the slave is her heir. He asks&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has lived there continuously, and no one has more right to it than he. He therefore humbly asks the all-embracing mercies and generous kindnesses for a noble rescript (to be written) on the back of his petition to the qāḍī al-muwaffaq&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with&nbsp; jurisdiction over al-Maḥalla and the surrounding region, with a copy to be deposited in his (the petitioner&rsquo;s) hand, instructing him to register it the slave&rsquo;s property in the manner in which property is registered with him as valid,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thus conveying his right to him, so that he may live in these splendid days,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a benefaction and a favor to him. To our lord, God&rsquo;s blessings be upon him, belongs the exalted opinion in this matter, if God wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone, and his blessings and peace upon our lord Muḥammad, our prophet, and his family.</p>
