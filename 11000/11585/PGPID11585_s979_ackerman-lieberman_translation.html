                        <ol><li>[Recor]d of witness testimony which took place before us—we, the witnesses who have sealed our testimony below in this document—that (his) hon(or and) ho[liness]</li><li>M(r.) master Eleazar the Elder, called Manṣūr, Head of the Congregations, b. Menahem of the town of //Aleppo// said to us, “Gentlemen, b[e]</li><li>witnesses on my behalf and perform a qinyan with me, a complete and weighty qinyan, effective immediately; write and sign on my behalf using all the language of claims. Give (it) </li><li>to Mr. Hillel the Elder b. Mr. Abraham known as (I)bn …Wāqa’ in order that there would be in his hand a title of right and proof after today. I [am not under]</li><li>duress nor am I (in) error, nor have I gone astray, nor am I ill, nor am I forced (to do this), rather in the fullness of my mind and desire and knowledge, I declare</li><li>before you in a complete and definitive declaration, a declaration made in good health, not as a deathbed declaration, in truth and righteousness,</li><li>with an open heart and mouth, I declare before you that I have given to this Mr. Hillel four cubits of my land which to which I have a permanent claim</li><li>and coupled thereto I have assigned him control, appointing him, assigning him and making him an agent and representative to claim from any person at all,</li><li>among them (his) hon(or and) hol(iness) Mr. Tamīm b. Isaac, known as (I)bn al-‘Amm, for all that which the deceased  Ṭibān b. the Maḥūẓ al-Qummī</li><li>left in Aleppo, to which Mulūk bt. Neḥuma b. Wahab, who is the wife of Mr. Joseph the Scri[be b. Manasseh]</li><li>known as (I)bn al-‘Anī, who is the (woman) who authorized me, had claim; and she wrote for me on her own (behalf) this agency collection document and authorized me to appoint</li><li>in my place an(other) agent to claim this legacy, giving me power to adjudicate his claim in any court</li><li>that he wishes, and to extract this legacy, and to take it for himself, to cause (others) to swear and to contract, to arbitrate</li><li>and to indemnify, to announce and to specify, and to respond. Everything which he does is done, as I have given him my hand, and I have placed him</li><li>in my place, and his words (are considered as) my words, and his demands (are considered as) my demands, and his claims (are considered as) my claims; and everything he does is done, and he accepts upon himself everything</li><li>imposed by the court. I am unable to go back and say, “(I retained you) to fulfill my (agency) and not to subvert it.”</li><li>Rather, everything he does is done. Responsibility for th[is] agency collection document is as [a decree of] the Sages, (may their) m(emory be) f(or a blessing)] for it is not [like promises]</li><li>and not like formularies, but rather (bears) the weight and force of all established legal agency collection documents which the Sages decreed</li><li>and [which] are generally [employed] from this day forward. We, the witnesses, performed a qinyan with an item sui[table for doing so, with our teacher and] master </li><li>Eleazar, called Manṣūr, Head of the Congregations, b. Menaḥem, and with Mr. Hillel b. Abr[aham, concerning] everything written </li><li>[and] specifi[ed above, as a ti]tle of right and proof after today. Written on Tuesda[y] the twenty-fifth day </li><li>of the mo[nth of Marḥeshvan of the year one th]ousand three hundred and sixty t[w]o, (of the Era) of Documents which we ordinarily</li><li>employ in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, which is situated on the Nile River. Proper and enduring.</li></ol>
