<li>
<p>The slave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū ʿAbdallāh, the baker from Fusṭāṭ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions, most excellent greetings and peace be upon our master and lord</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the imām al-ʿĀḍid li-Dīn AlIāh, commander of the faithful, and upon his pure ancestors and expected sons,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enduring benedictions, which last until the day of judgement. The slave kisses the ground and reports to the lofty, exalted and sublime seat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the great lord, (commander of) the armies, sword (of Islam), the protector (of the judges of the Muslims), the defender (of mankind), the guide (of the dāʿīs of the believers), {and} may (God) strengthen the religion through him,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gratify the commander of the faithful by his longevity, cause his power to endure, exalt his word and execute his commands and judgments upon the face of the earth,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and reports that he is a poor man, with a family and children, a baker in Fusṭāṭ, and that he is in debt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to a man called ʿAbd al-Bāqī ibn Wardar. He is too poor to pay it off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the aforementioned creditor is demanding it from him in a cruel fashion. The slave requests the kindness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and benefaction of the issuing of an incontrovertible ordinance to the mighty judge to look into</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his situation and allow him to pay the debt in instalments, according to his condition, and to treat him leniently, so that he may find the means</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of dwelling in his native city, support his beloved family and live a new life in these days of the (commander of) the armies,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God, the exalted, cause them to remain and make eternal the reign of the one who rules during them, as a benefaction and kindness to him. To the exalted resolutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>belongs the merit of loftiness and power regarding that, if God, the exalted, wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and his family and save them.</p>
</li>
