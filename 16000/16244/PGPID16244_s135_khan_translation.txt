Recto 


Nāṣir ibn Jibrīl came to Makārim ibn Isḥāq, the Jewish physician,  


together with his natural daughter called Sutayt,  


in whose left eye there was pus. He requested the aforementioned physician  


to treat her eye with a sharp knife.  


If God, exalted is he, grants sight, his remuneration will be two dirhams.  


If the outcome is the opposite, he will evaluate the fee accordingly and the physician   


will be free from liability for that.  


 
Recto- witness 


I was called to witness this.  


It was written by ʿAbd al-Qawī ibn ʿAbd al-Muʿṭī  


ibn Hilāl al-Anṣārī.
