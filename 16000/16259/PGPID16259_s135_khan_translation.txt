Recto 

The slave

[ ] Mukhliṣ, inhabitant of Minyat Ghamr.


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


(The slave) reports to the seat of the master Shams aI-Dīn, the sword of the warriors,


the support of kings and sultans, may God cause his days to endure and make eternal


his rule and the rule of his sultan and show mercy to his parents and his relatives, 


(reports) that I am a man who has been dwelling in a hostel for a number of years. No harm has been done to the slave


from the day he began living there until the present. But now


a man has moved into the slave's neighborhood with his children. The slave has suffered


great harm from his young son. Every time the slave complains


about the affair to his father he adorns the appearance of the slave's story


before the people and his son is allowed to go out 


and brazenly set upon the slave


 
Right margin 

with impudence. The slave is a certified witness in Minyat Ghamr.

Verso


He has had the audacity to injure the slave's wife with his teeth in front of people without any cause.


The slave is a man of property and is a devout and learned man,


yet he (has be obliged to) leave all the property that he possesses and (has suffered) other


wrongs and mistreatment. He places his trust in the protection of the presence of the master and his justice.


The slave requests the examination of his case (and) the issuing of a command to investigate


the affair of the slave to establish how the youth is encroaching upon the rights


of the slave. When he has had proof of the harm and the impudence of the youth,


which he has unjustly inflicted on the slave, let the master requite him with the justice he deserves,


and the master will be graciously offered a pious personal prayer by the slave at 


the end of each statutory prayer. Peace.
