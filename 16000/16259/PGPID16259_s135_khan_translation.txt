The slave


[ ] Mukliṣ, inhabitant of Minyat Ġamr.


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


(The slave) reports to the seat of the master Šams aI-Dīn, the sword of the warriors,


the support of kings and sultans, may God cause his days to endure and make eternal


his rule and the rule of his sultan and show mercy to his parents and his relatives, 


(reports) that I am a man who has been dwelling in a hostel for a number of years. No harm has been done to the slave


from the day he began living there until the present. But now


a man has moved into the slave's neighbourhood with his children. The slave has suffered


great harm from his young son. Every time the slave complains


about the affair to his father he adorns the appearance of the slave's story


before the people and his son is allowed to go out 


and brazenly set upon the slave


 
Right margin 

with impudence. The slave is a certified witness in Minyat Ġamr.
