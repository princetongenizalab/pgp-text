<li>
<p>from the day he began living there until the present. But now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a man has moved into the slave's neighbourhood with his children. The slave has suffered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>great harm from his young son. Every time the slave complains</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about the affair to his father he adorns the appearance of the slave's story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>before the people and his son is allowed to go out&nbsp;</p>
