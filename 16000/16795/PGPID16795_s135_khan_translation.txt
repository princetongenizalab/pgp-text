The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings be upon our master and lord


the 'imām al-Mustanṣir bi-Allāh, commander of the faithful, and upon his pure ancestors and most noble sons.


The slave of our master, the blessings of God be upon him, kisses the ground and humbly requests him to employ him.
