Recto 


God is the support. It was registered in the  archives of the prospering court .....  


 . .... money of a known amount.  


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  


This is what Ṣāfī ibn ʿAbdallāh, the freedman of the elder Abū al-Faḍl Ibrāhīm  ibn ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Anbārī, granted, with the permission of the son of his  master,  


to Dhakhīra ibnat Jāmiʿ, from the community of the estate known as Migdal Kurūm in the district of ʿAkko, and married her with it. He granted her, with the  permission  


of this son of his master, Abū al-Ghanāʾim ʿAbd al-Karīm, fifteen dīnārs, gold, in  minted coin, weighed according to the standard weight, assayed, sound, of good alloy, 


and of this paid to her in advance five dīnārs, gold and standard weight. She took them from him for herself, completely and in full, and released him from them  and from all of the marriage gift.
