Recto 


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  


Ḥanūn ibn ʿAlūn, the Christian clerk in the Dār al-Dībāj, states that: I have sold  to the elder ʿArūs ibn Yūsuf, the Jew  


from Fusṭāṭ, a Christian slave girl and her son Qiwām and I have guaranteed to him that whenever any claim is made against him on account of the price, and  nothing else,  


it will be incumbent on me to free him from this or to pay it for him from my money, she being a carob coloured slave girl with a dependent son, who is a slave boy;  


and (also states) that he has no complaint about her to me on account of a defect or anything else except his dispute with regard to the price. I have received 


from him the price, this being twenty-one dīnārs, except for the commission included in this sum. He has granted me a quittance from that and from any oath  upon it or upon any part of it,  


from any other person, whether a relative or a stranger. He wrote with his own hand in the first ten days of the month of Ramaḍān in the year  


four-hundred and eighty-three. I called God, exalted is he, to be my witness concerning this. Judgement always belongs to God.
