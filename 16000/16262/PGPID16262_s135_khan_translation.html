                        <h3>Recto </h3>

<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ḥanūn ibn ʿAlūn, the Christian clerk in the Dār al-Dībāj, states that: I have sold&nbsp; to the elder ʿArūs ibn Yūsuf, the Jew&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from Fusṭāṭ, a Christian slave girl and her son Qiwām and I have guaranteed to him that whenever any claim is made against him on account of the price, and&nbsp; nothing else,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it will be incumbent on me to free him from this or to pay it for him from my money, she being a carob coloured slave girl with a dependent son, who is a slave boy;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and (also states) that he has no complaint about her to me on account of a defect or anything else except his dispute with regard to the price. I have received&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from him the price, this being twenty-one dīnārs, except for the commission included in this sum. He has granted me a quittance from that and from any oath&nbsp; upon it or upon any part of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from any other person, whether a relative or a stranger. He wrote with his own hand in the first ten days of the month of Ramaḍān in the year&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>four-hundred and eighty-three. I called God, exalted is he, to be my witness concerning this. Judgement always belongs to God.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The note for (the boy) Qiwām of the maid-servant from Ibn Zurʿa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
