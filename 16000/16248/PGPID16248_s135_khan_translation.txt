In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. Praise be to God, lord of  the universe.  


Abū al-Ḥasan - this patronymic being his name - Ibn Yaḥyā, the Christian bath  attendant, who is a short man, with a smooth  


forehead, in which there are wrinkles, with separated (eyebrows), dark brown  (eyes), a rough nose, on the bridge of which there is a scar, with protruding  cheek bones, entwined beard, there being a little grey at its tip,  


acknowledged, calling people to be his witnesses, acting willingly, in sound health  and his acts being legal, that he is under obligation and owes ʿAlī ibn Ibhrāhīm,  the watchman [ … ]   


[...] al-Naṣr ibn Abū al-Qāsim al [ … ] two dīnārs, standard weight, full  weight, of good aIloy, an established debt and a binding right with legal force, 


falling due ... [ … ]  ... when they wish, night or day, he will not delay  payment of that to them  


in any way whatsoever, and he will pay this debt without entering into litigation  against it and without any choice being granted him in any way whatsoever.  


They accepted that from him with a valid acceptance [ … ] ... he recognized  all of it and their acknowledgement of all of it  


… they being in sound health and their acts being legal [ … ]
