On Thursday


There came to us


H'usayn son of R. Moses


and said to us, Hear ye! You are the court. I have said what I have to tell


you and informed you that every debt owed me by


others I will not give up; rather,


I will collect it whenever I so desire, and you will help me


in accordance with your authority as a court

          Elijah son of R. Zechariah (may his) s(oul) b(e) b(ound) i(n the bundle of) t(he living).
