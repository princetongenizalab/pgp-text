<p>A mighty decree, at the top of which in the writing of the exalted hand (there is a motto):</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God, lord of the universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the beloved slave of God, al-Manṣūr &lsquo;Abū &lsquo;Alī, the &lsquo;imām al-Ḥākim bi-&rsquo;Amr&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allāh, commander of the faithful, son of the 'imām, al-&rsquo;Azīz bi-Allāh, commander of the faithful,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the community of Karaite Jews, in Fusṭāṭ and elsewhere. On account of the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>righteous path that the commander of the faithful follows and the just course that he pursues,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he has given instructions for you to be separated from the Rabbanites, due to the cleavage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>between you regarding the law and your differences regarding ritually clean</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and unclean food. He has removed you from the jurisdiction of the judge of this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sect and put you [&nbsp; &nbsp;]</p>
