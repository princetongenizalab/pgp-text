Recto


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  


The people attaching their signature and registering their name (below), they being [free],  


 trustworthy Muslims, whose statements in their testimonies are accepted, testified  that they have examined Ibrāhīm ibn Bū al-ʿUlā  


the Jew (and found that) he has been inflicted with black humour and this has caused him to contract leprosy;  


and that this prevents him from moving freely and going about his business among Muslims.  


Since they recognized the validity of this after examining him and being apprised  of the true nature of his disease,  


and since someone has requested them to register their testimony to what they  recognize, they have responded 


to him by registering it, in the first ten days of Rabīʿ II of the year six-hundred and sixty.
