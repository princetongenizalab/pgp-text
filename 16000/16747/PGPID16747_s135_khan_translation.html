<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people attaching their signature and registering their name (below), they being [free],&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;trustworthy Muslims, whose statements in their testimonies are accepted, testified&nbsp; that they have examined Ibrāhīm ibn Bū al-ʿUlā&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Jew (and found that) he has been inflicted with black humour and this has caused him to contract leprosy;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and that this prevents him from moving freely and going about his business among Muslims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since they recognized the validity of this after examining him and being apprised&nbsp; of the true nature of his disease,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and since someone has requested them to register their testimony to what they&nbsp; recognize, they have responded&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him by registering it, in the first ten days of Rabīʿ II of the year six-hundred and sixty.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
