Hiba ibn ʿAlī ibn [ ], the carpenter, leased from al-Ḥasan ibn Makkī ibn Abī  al-Ḥadīd, who was the lessor,

that is in the possession of Ibrāhīm ibn Fatḥ, in the vicinity of the ʿAbdawī canal in the town of Tyre in the district known as  


Banī Muṣʿab and Ibn Waḥshī, with all its rights, boundaries and amenities, for one  complete year,  


starting at the beginning of Muḥarram of the year four-hundred and ten until its  end,  


for one dīnār and an eighth, gold, in minted coin of good alloy. Hiba ibn 'Ali paid in advance  


one half dīnār, in gold conforming to this description, out of the total amount of  this rent. He still owes a half and one eighth of a dīnār,  


payable by him in five instalments in this year, (paying) in every instalment an  eighth of a dīnār. The first  


of these instalments is owed by him at the beginning of the month of Rabīʿ I of  the year four-hundred and ten,  


and thenceforth likewise [ ] every two months an eighth of a dīnar will be  due from him until he has payed this half and one eighth of a dīnār in full 


[ al-Ḥasan] ibn Makkī and he handed over to him what he leased to  him and Hibat [ ] took it.
