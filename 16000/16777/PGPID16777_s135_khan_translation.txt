[ ] my most glorious lord


When the slave [[established]] learnt of the good intention, the kind view and the noble patronage,


he desired to show reverence to his lofty presence, may God increase its glory


and establish his magnificence, for his glorious actions of the past through which he honourably achieved


celebrity and distinction and more [[glorious]] fine qualities


than the preceding 'amīrs of Yemen who have been appointed previously by the


government.


His slaves will relate to him - may God [[establish]] cause his rule to endure - what the slave has charged them with concerning this, for he, by God, is prepared. 


If he has among [your 'amīrs]] the 'amīrs of the Arabs a slave who is at his disposal


[ ] his adherence to him (?).
