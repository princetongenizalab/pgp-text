<li>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</li>
<li>The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent peace and greetings be upon</li>
<li>our master and lord, the imām al-Āmir bi-Aḥkām Allāh, commander of the faithful,</li>
<li>and upon his pure ancestors and most noble sons — enduring benedictions that last </li>
<li>until the day of judgment. The slave kisses the ground before </li>
<li>the noble and exalted prophetic presence, may God double its light and raise aloft </li>
<li>forever its beacon, and reports the continued arrival of the Rūm merchants, who have arrived </li>
<li>with timber, and whose coming the slave had reported. They are Sergius </li>
<li>the son of Constantine, .... the son of ... , Grasso the son of Leo the Amalfitan,</li>
<li>... and Bon Senyon the Genoese, and their companions who are with them.</li>
<li>They say that up to the time of the slave's writing this report, the </li>
<li>[ ] of the timber that they brought has not been established and no .... has reached them.</li>
