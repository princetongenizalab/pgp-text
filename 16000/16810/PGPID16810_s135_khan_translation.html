<li>
<p>ibn ʿAdnān states that: I have received from the elder Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn&nbsp; Judayd part of the barley, the delivery of which has been ordered,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when it was conveyed to the &lsquo;protected camp&rsquo; ... And the letter of the government office has reached him indicating [ &hellip; ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three-thousand, one hundred and thirty-four irdabbs, reckoning at a rate of ten sifted waybas (per irdabb),&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>half an irdabb being five sifted waybas, together with the share that is customarily assigned to the shipowners,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this being a quarter of a wayba for every irdabb. Half of this is one thousand,&nbsp; five-hundred and sixty-seven irdabbs. He has taken the produce&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the ship and conveyed it to the coast with the lighthouse. I have released him from its measure&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and quantity, with a quittance for full receipt of all of it. He wrote with his own&nbsp; hand in the twenty-fifth of Shawwāl&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the year four-hundred and twenty-two.</p>
