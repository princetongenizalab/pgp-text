 In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  


Hiba ibn Boqṭor ibn [ … ], the companion of the Amīr Dhakhīrat al-Dawla Ḥaydara ibn Muḥammad  


ibn ʿAdnān states that: I have received from the elder Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn  Judayd part of the barley, the delivery of which has been ordered, 


when it was conveyed to the ‘protected camp’ ... And the letter of the government office has reached him indicating [ … ]  


three-thousand, one hundred and thirty-four irdabbs, reckoning at a rate of ten sifted waybas (per irdabb),  


half an irdabb being five sifted waybas, together with the share that is customarily assigned to the shipowners,  


this being a quarter of a wayba for every irdabb. Half of this is one thousand,  five-hundred and sixty-seven irdabbs. He has taken the produce  


in the ship and conveyed it to the coast with the lighthouse. I have released him from its measure  


and quantity, with a quittance for full receipt of all of it. He wrote with his own  hand in the twenty-fifth of Shawwāl  


of the year four-hundred and twenty-two.
