<li>
<p>in his protection, with the status of a wife [ &hellip; ]&nbsp; standard weight, gold, in minted coin, full weight, of good alloy [ &hellip; ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he received them from her and they became an established debt owed by him to her, and a binding right with legal force, the payment of all of it by him to her being due. She may claim payment of it, or of whatever part of it she wishes,&nbsp; from him, she wishes ... [ whenever]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>she wishes and sees fit, night or day, morning or evening, without any&nbsp; postponement of this, protesting, malicious interpretation, finding faults, appeal, ..&nbsp; [ &hellip; ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>without an oath concerning this, or any part of it, taken by him against her, or&nbsp; litigation, in any way whatsoever. He is solvent to the amount of this&nbsp; aforementioned debt, this being three [hundred dīnārs &hellip; ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more than this by [ &hellip; ]fold, this being what is in his possession to his credit, in cash or on account, and what remains by this and more than it. Whenever he makes a claim against her for that, by which he tries to [spend it]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[or] part of it or seeks from her an oath upon it or litigation, his claim regarding&nbsp; that is void, with no foundation or truth. He recognizes and is aware that the recto, [with regard to what]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>the aforementioned acknowledgement has made binding [upon him with regard to&nbsp; her]. He acknowledged that after it had come into force. His wife, this Amat&nbsp; aI-Qādir, the one to whom the acknowledgement was made, accepted all of that with a valid acceptance, and ratified every&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detail that was stated in it, with an effective ratification, in a dialogue that took place between them concerning it. The acknowledgement of the acknowledger of the debt and of his wife, the one to whom the acknowledgement was made, who are named [ ] was witnessed,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after it had been read to them from beginning to end, word for word, while they were in sound health, their acts were legal and they were acting voluntarily. This&nbsp; document was written as corroboration for that and proof in the course of one&nbsp; day (?) [ &hellip; ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
