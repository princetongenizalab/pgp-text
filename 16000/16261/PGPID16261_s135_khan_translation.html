<li>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</li>
<li>The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings be upon our master and lord the imam al-Mustanṣir bi-Allāh,</li>
<li>commander of the faithful, the blessings of God be upon him and upon his pure ancestors and most noble sons. The slave of my master, the blessings of God beupon him, takes refuge in God,</li>
<li>of exalted name, and in the justice of the prophetic dynasty, on account of the following: He had a son, a man of twenty-three years of age, who travelled</li>
<li>from Sirsinā in a boat, together with a merchant, a young man who was also twenty-three years old.</li>
<li>They carried in partnership five-hundred dīnārs in cash and goods worth two-hundred dīnārs.</li>
<li>They were making for the town of Fuwwa and, from there, to Alexandria. The captain of the boat and the sailors</li>
<li>in it betrayed the two aforementioned young men, killed them and took</li>
<li>the money and the goods that they were carrying. The slave of our master, God bless him, taking refuge in God, of exalted name,</li>
<li>and in the justice of the prophetic dynasty, may God establish its supports, asks for a rescript to be issued to</li>
<li>the lieutenants of the prosperous amīr, Sinān al-Dawla, to arrest those sailors and the captain of the boat and to investigate</li>
<li>this case, so that the truthfulness of what the slave has said be know. To our master,</li>
<li>God bless him, belongs the exalted resolution in this matter, if God wills.</li>
