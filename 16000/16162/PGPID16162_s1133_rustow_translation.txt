Recto


I, Natanʾel bar Tamīm, testify that I have guaranteed


for Saʿīd b. Yūsuf the delivery of his signed document, which 


he owes to Mufaḍḍal b. Salāma b. Saʿīd


on account of the signed document that he was supposed to accept from him


in the name of Ibn Najīb al-Dawla


but then he didn’t appear, and indemnifies him from any


obligation, by way of exemption. To that effect, 


Natan ha-Kohen bar Shelomo ha-Kohen wrote his signature.


Right margin

(Also signed) Efrayim b. Yosef.
