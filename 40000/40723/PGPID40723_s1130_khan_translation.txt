In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
Jurayj ibn Yuḥannis the Nubian acknowledged
and called people to witness himself, (he being) healthy
in mind and body and legally capable of conducting his affairs,
willingly, not forced or coerced,
this being when fourteen nights remained
of Jumādā II in the year four-hundred and thirty,
that he had divorced his wife, Maryam
ibnat Yuḥannis with one act of repudiation,
by which she acquired from him possession of herself, and control of herself.
The acknowledgement by the divorcer and the divorcee
of all that was mentioned in it was witnessed, they being in soundness of mind
and body, legally capable of conducting their affairs, willing,
not forced or coerced. That was in Jumādā.
