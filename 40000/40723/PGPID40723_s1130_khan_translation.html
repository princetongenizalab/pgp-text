<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>Jurayj ibn Yuḥannis the Nubian acknowledged</li>
<li>and called people to witness himself, (he being) healthy</li>
<li>in mind and body and legally capable of conducting his affairs,</li>
<li>willingly, not forced or coerced,</li>
<li>this being when fourteen nights remained</li>
<li>of Jumādā II in the year four-hundred and thirty,</li>
<li>that he had divorced his wife, Maryam</li>
<li>ibnat Yuḥannis with one act of repudiation,</li>
<li>by which she acquired from him possession of herself, and control of herself.</li>
<li>The acknowledgement by the divorcer and the divorcee</li>
<li>of all that was mentioned in it was witnessed, they being in soundness of mind</li>
<li>and body, legally capable of conducting their affairs, willing,</li>
<li>not forced or coerced. That was in Jumādā.</li>
