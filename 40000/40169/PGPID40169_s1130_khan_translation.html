                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the Ik&scaron;īl, Master of the Horses, vizier of the king, the governor of the districts of the land of al-Marīs&mdash;</li>
<li>may God prolong his life and cause his wellbeing to endure&mdash;that I sent two of my sons, called Qāsim</li>
<li>and Abū ʿAbd Allāh to Erkinun in order for them to dwellthere, as your guests and the guests</li>
<li>of the king, may God preserve his life. I did not send them for trade nor for benefit through selling and</li>
<li>buying. Rather, I sent them to be at the disposition of theking and (stay) in his land until</li>
<li>God permits. I shall convey to them cloth for them to send to the king, may God preserve his life, and so that they can</li>
<li>see his crown (i.e., have an audience with him) and become his slaves, like my father the rightly-guided judge&mdash;perhaps you have heard of him&mdash;</li>
<li>and my grandfather, and my cousin, the judge Abū al-Faḍl. My grandfather travelled to visit the just king</li>
<li>Basil and my father travelled to visit King Mūyis, the father of Mena Kurē (?), as a messenger</li>
<li>from the ruler, may God strengthen his victory, to Soba. It is he who strove to make a peace treaty between</li>
<li>the ruler and the king when the situation deteriorated in the days of King David.</li>
<li>My cousin, the judge ʾAbū al-Faḍl travelled to visit King Mūyis as a messenger of the ruler</li>
<li>to Soba. I myself travelled with my cousin when I was young to Soba to visit King</li>
<li>Mūyis. I was received by him very well. My son, Hibat Allāh, travelled to the just king</li>
<li>Mūyis, while he was in Dongola, and was received very well by him and he bestowed gifts of honour upon him.</li>
<li>My children, my father and my forefathers are known for their (court) service of the previous kings and we have</li>
<li>been treated very well by them. Our property, from which we have a livelihood, is in their country. I would</li>
<li>like to express my wish to the Master of the Horses that there be a long-term acquaintance and friendship between the two of us.</li>
<li>I have sent my sons as harbingers before I reach him and before I enter the country</li>
<li>of the king. If you would do the kindness of sending a letter to the king, may God preserve his life, informing him of everything</li>
<li>I have mentioned and my wish to come to his country, then please do so. Also obtain for me from him</li>
<li>a letter from the king to the Master of the Horses /to you/instructing that he treats me</li>
<li>and my sons well and treats me in the same way as my forefathers, and instruct you</li>
<li>in the letter to provide me with a house in Ibrīm, a house in Adminna and a house</li>
<li>in Erkinun, so that I can build them and I can live in whichever of these houses I wish together with my sons.</li>
<li>Let his (the king&rsquo;s) signature be on the letter, if God, the Mighty and Glorious, wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet.</li>
