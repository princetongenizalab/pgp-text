Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
(This is) my letter to you, my father, who is dear to me, may God prolong your life and cause your power,
your support, your happiness and your good health to endure, may He establish His granting of prosperity, may He not leave you alone, may He make me
your redemption from all evil and may He bestow upon you every goodness. What I (write to) inform you of is that I have not ceased looking out for
Ḥajjāj. I have asked about him and people have told me that he is in a town in the north. God willing, I shall
meet him and shall request from him what you mentioned to me. I would like to describe to you what has happened to me due to ʿAbd al-Raḥmān,
your plougher, who is in the island. He has dismissed the man whom you yourself appointed and Manṣūr feared
that we could not sell. They gave notification and moved the plough from the island and took it
to the town of Edfu. They shat upon us. I am not with them in any way. Please could you make
the authoritative decision with regard to this. By God, by God, by God, if you have somebody with you who would like to come to earn a wage,
do not delay for a moment and engage him in cultivation for two weeks. The harvest will be on the fifteenth
of the month of Baramhāt. Do not delay carrying it out. Greetings.
