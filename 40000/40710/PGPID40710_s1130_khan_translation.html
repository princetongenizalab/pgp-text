                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>(This is) my letter to you, my father, who is dear to me, may God prolong your life and cause your power,</li>
<li>your support, your happiness and your good health to endure, may He establish His granting of prosperity, may He not leave you alone, may He make me</li>
<li>your redemption from all evil and may He bestow upon you every goodness. What I (write to) inform you of is that I have not ceased looking out for</li>
<li>Ḥajjāj. I have asked about him and people have told me that he is in a town in the north. God willing, I shall</li>
<li>meet him and shall request from him what you mentioned to me. I would like to describe to you what has happened to me due to ʿAbd al-Raḥmān,</li>
<li>your plougher, who is in the island. He has dismissed the man whom you yourself appointed and Manṣūr feared</li>
<li>that we could not sell. They gave notification and moved the plough from the island and took it</li>
<li>to the town of Edfu. They shat upon us. I am not with them in any way. Please could you make</li>
<li>the authoritative decision with regard to this. By God, by God, by God, if you have somebody with you who would like to come to earn a wage,</li>
<li>do not delay for a moment and engage him in cultivation for two weeks. The harvest will be on the fifteenth</li>
<li>of the month of Baramhāt. Do not delay carrying it out. Greetings.</li>
