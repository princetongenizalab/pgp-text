In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
Raḥma ibn Saʿīd leased from Danī ibn Kannān al-Shaḵriyābī—he leased from him with one clapping (ofthe hand) and with one contract three shares
from twenty-four shares in total, held in common, of the lands of the island known as ʾAbū Fāris to the west of the border of Nubia,
which is administered in his estate assigned to him by the Office of the Ruler, may God strengthen his victory, with all its boundaries, rights and amenities in
the said island for a period of a year, beginning in (the month of) Kīhak of the year five-hundred and eighteen(December 1124 AD) with a rent of three dīnārs, of standard weight,
in gold, in minted coin of full weight, valid Egyptian coins of al-ʾĀmir, of good alloy. The lessee paid the lessornamed with him all the price,
the said price and he received it from him in total and in full and released him from it with a release customary on the receipt in full.
He delivered to him what he leased to him with regard to the said island. He allowed him to pay in instalments until the aforementioned amount is delivered, monthly with the produce of a month at its end,
until the completion of the said year. Whatever claim comes upon the aforementioned lessee from the Office of the Ruler, may God strengthen his victory,
or from anybody, it is the duty of Danī ibn Kannān to clear it and pay him what is required by the law of the legal instruments of
the Muslims and their warranty. They agreed and consented to this while they were in sound health and able toconduct their affairs in the first ten days of Rajab of the year
five-hundred and eighteen (August 1124 AD).
