<li>and cause his strength and good fortune to endure&mdash;of the arrival of the bearer of this letter to the land of the Nubians, together with a horse</li>
<li>in order to seek his livelihood by selling it. He is some-body who should be treated correctly, protected and cared for.</li>
<li>He has a right to your customary protection, so that heis able to have access to the administrators and others</li>
<li>of your slaves and servants, because it is incumbent uponyour honour to protect and care for him</li>
<li>in your customary way3 until he returns&mdash;for which hewill be grateful&mdash;since he has a good reputation. A letterhas reached me by the hand</li>
<li>of your slave boy Ipisi and I wrote a reply to it. As fornews from the north, since</li>
<li>the exalted and great honourable presence left,4 only what was easily available has reached us. Affairs are all in order, God be praised.</li>
<li>Your servants have not come downriver. Write to us about it. Greetings. Praise be to God alone and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, the prophet, and his family, and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
