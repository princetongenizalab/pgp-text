Basmala (i.e., in the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate).
(This is) my letter to my brother and my lord, the dearest person to me, may God prolong his life and cause his strength, his elevation,
his ascendance and his splendour to endure. I have great longing for him and I, therefore, ask God that we shall meet
soon. As for other matters, O brother, what he needed has been conveyed from what remained from the price of the two baskets
of cotton, which were with our brother Mufliḥ, namely thirty-two dirhams. If he has brought pure coins, then receive them and convey to me a share.
If you cannot obtain pure coins, then send to me their value. But
trust me and leave it to me. On another matter, when I arrive from my long journey, I shall set off again,
and when I collect it at your place, if it is with you—you know what my view is about this.
I am grateful only to God, the Exalted. It was a terrible year for me and a terrible journey.
Best wishes to you and to our brother Ḥusayn greetings and to our brother the freedman greetings.
