<li>Basmala (i.e., in the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate).</li>
<li>(This is) my letter to my brother and my lord, the dearest person to me, may God prolong his life and cause his strength, his elevation,</li>
<li>his ascendance and his splendour to endure. I have great longing for him and I, therefore, ask God that we shall meet</li>
<li>soon. As for other matters, O brother, what he needed has been conveyed from what remained from the price of the two baskets</li>
<li>of cotton, which were with our brother Mufliḥ, namely thirty-two dirhams. If he has brought pure coins, then receive them and convey to me a share.</li>
<li>If you cannot obtain pure coins, then send to me their value. But</li>
<li>trust me and leave it to me. On another matter, when I arrive from my long journey, I shall set off again,</li>
<li>and when I collect it at your place, if it is with you&mdash;you know what my view is about this.</li>
<li>I am grateful only to God, the Exalted. It was a terrible year for me and a terrible journey.</li>
<li>Best wishes to you and to our brother Ḥusayn greetings and to our brother the freedman greetings.</li>
