<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the presence of my lord, the Master of the Horses&mdash;may God prolong his life and cause his strength to endure&mdash;of the arrival of a letter by the hand of your slave boy</li>
<li>Ipisi on the matter of the place that was discussed previously with the sharīf. The man mentioned (the sharīf?)</li>
<li>is absent. When he arrives, I shall meet with him and talk to him concerning what I know. What I would like to tell</li>
<li>my honourable lord is that my goods are in the place of my brother Lāmiʿ. Following instructions and undertaking your service</li>
<li>is an obligatory duty for me for your sake. May God, the Blessed and Exalted, bring bounty to you.</li>
<li>As for the southern land, people have been arriving from there complaining about the lieutenant (al-khalīfa), the Master of</li>
<li>the Shipmasts, and a deputy (nāʾib) of the Qūsa. On account of this call for help in the land, the commander has come down and reprimanded the lieutenant (al-khalīfa)</li>
<li>and forbidden him to do wrong to anybody. He recognises your efforts to do good and likewise,</li>
<li>also my honourable lord. His (the commander&rsquo;s) letters are arriving all the time giving instructions to protect the people of Nubia. As for the slaves of the Master</li>
<li>of the Horses, please take care of them and provide them with their needs. This matter necessitated the repudiation of the lieutenant (al-khalīfa)</li>
<li>and reprimanding him. Do not write in opposition to this and do not listen to anybody except them. May God, the Blessed and Exalted,</li>
<li>give you bounty. I would like a letter to be sent to all the administrators requesting them to protect the places of Lāmiʿ and his servants</li>
<li>and likewise my places and my servants. You know that they all perform good services to the king and to you. The lieutenant (al-khalīfa) mentioned that he has</li>
<li>instructions and he adhered to all of these. He wrote to Ibn ʿImrān, the deputy (nāʾib) of your honour, asking him about his salary</li>
<li>and he gave him his usual salary. Do not delay sending letters to me about your news. The commander is expecting</li>

                        <ol>
<li>in great anticipation news to reach him from your honour. Ensure that your letters reach</li>
<li>the commander. Your envoys are in contact with him all the time. He has instructed that &ldquo;when</li>
<li>a letter from the Master of the Horses arrives, they should send it to me with anybody who comes here.&rdquo; Likewise my brother Lāmiʿ is expecting your letters.</li>
