I
Ṣedaqah ben Maqmalyah, inform me YHWH in a dream
this night, what I should do so that I may be righteous
before you as you eternally like


I Ṣedaqah ben Ma[qma]lyah, inform me in a dream this night
YHWH the path of the righteous people: and he will teach me
to make His will my will
and for His great name
since I have no God but you
and to You only I hereby pray.
