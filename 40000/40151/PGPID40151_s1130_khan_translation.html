                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the Ikshīl, vizier of the king, master of the horses&mdash;</li>
<li>may God prolong his life, cause his strength to endure, and cause his enemy</li>
<li>and opponent to perish&mdash;that the bearer of this letter, who is (called) Munʿim,</li>
<li>one of my servants, has set off (to you) carrying two garments of mixed silk and four</li>
<li>pieces of cloth for the master of the horses. When the bearer of this letter reaches</li>
<li>you, release him and send him away quickly, so he can reach me, if God wills,</li>
<li>because I want to send him to the north to carry out some errands for me.</li>
<li>The master (of the horses) does not need in this matter instruction, ratification or</li>
<li>repetition with regard to what should be done. I am aware of the love of the master of the horses</li>
<li>for me and for carrying out my requests to him. Whatever request you may have,</li>
<li>write and inform me of it, so that I can give an order for it to be carried out. I am deputising</li>
<li>for my brother. On another matter, the commander has written that he will arrive and he will give instructions for your sake and for the sake of</li>
<li>14. the carrying out of your requests. He also mentions (the need) to safeguard the subjects and protect the merchants</li>
<li>who are travelling to you from among the merchant community (and mentions) the country of the king</li>
<li>and its guarding and protection. Please give whatever reply you need to the bearer of this letter and send him</li>
<li>quickly to me. Best wishes to you and best wishes to those whom your care encompasses.</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>Praise be to God alone and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and peace. Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
