<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>(This is) my letter to my brother Ḵalīl and my brother ʿUthmān</li>
<li>and ʿUmar, may God prolong their life, and cause their good health</li>
<li>and wellbeing to endure. What I wish to inform you of is that I have arrived</li>
<li>in Aswan and both I and the horse are exhausted.</li>
<li>You know that I departed from you</li>
<li>without (additional) clothes, and I left my clothes</li>
<li>with you. You know that I received</li>
<li>a letter from my family. By God,</li>
<li>please could one of you come downriver quickly</li>
<li>to me. Do not (hesitate to) consider how one would come downriver.</li>
<li>We do not have anything to pay you.</li>
<li>I know that you do not have anything and if</li>
<li>you had anything, you would not regard it as being too generous</li>
<li>to give it to me. By God, the minute you read</li>
<li>this note, one of you please come to me</li>
<li>quickly, taking my clothes</li>
<li>with you&mdash;the sleeved garment, the shirt</li>
<li>the helmet and bedding. If they have sold them,</li>
<li>that is fine. If they still remain,</li>
<li>then bring them with you as well as the two water-skins</li>

<li>and the beads for the children. As for the twisted</li>
<li>leather thong for the women, in which</li>
<li>there is scent, this is in the bag together with</li>
<li>the beads. Bring it (the thong) with you. As for slaves,</li>
<li>there is nothing in Aswan, or only a few. By God,</li>
<li>bring your slave girl with you.</li>
<li>Come only in a boat. Do not bring a horse.</li>
<li>When you come downriver, take my horse</li>
<li>and go back upriver. By God, one of you please come</li>
<li>quickly, quickly, even if you have a thousand</li>
<li>things to do. By God, oh my brother Khalīl,</li>
<li>(who are) a decent man, there is no harm from the gifts that</li>
<li>he has paid to him. Do not let him go anywhere.</li>
<li>Oh my brother Khalīl, where is our father and where</li>
<li>are our companions? Only I and you remain.</li>
<li>By God, do not listen to what anybody says and do not go</li>
<li>from place to place in the citadel (listening to gossip), for</li>
<li>there is no good in it. Greetings to you.</li>
<li>By God, you are three! Behave like</li>
<li>men with each other. Greetings.</li>
<li>That is more worthy of you.</li>

<li>From their brother</li>
