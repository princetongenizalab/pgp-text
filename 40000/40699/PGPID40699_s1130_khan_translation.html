<li>In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The slave asks my honourable master, the sublime elder, the secretary, may God cause his strength to endure,</li>
<li>to kiss the hands of my sublime master, the Master of the Horses, (U)ruwī, the son of my sublime master [Īsū],</li>
<li>(the slave writing the letter being) his (the eparch&rsquo;s) slave and the slave of his father before him, and informs him (the secretary) that the letter of your honour has reached his slave (the writer)</li>
<li>and he has read it. The only thing preventing the slave (the writer) from sending your honour a letter (earlier)</li>
<li>is that the slave (the writer) no longer had the means to send it safely.</li>
<li>He (the secretary) is the one most deserving of the best letter of the slave (the writer), which would give him (the secretary) the right to enjoy</li>
<li>Eden. The slave (the writer) requests his honour to write a letter</li>
<li>to the slave (the writer) so that it be in his hand and mention in it the lieutenant Peti</li>
<li>and the Master of the Shipmasts (asking them) not to listen to anybody saying</li>
<li>things like &ldquo;Have we triumphed over his slave in the (trading) places?&rdquo; It has been hidden from you who</li>
<li>the people saying this are. It is like somebody with malicious intent. I request</li>
<li>my master (to write) a letter in which this is mentioned to ʿUqayl al-ʿAjmānī</li>
<li>in which you inform him of my situation, my slaves, and my cultivators</li>
<li>and you inform the lieutenant Peti and the Master of the Shipmasts about my situation</li>
<li>before my master (the eparch) returns from his journey, God willing. I have decided</li>
<li>to go up to meet him, God willing. The slave will ask</li>
<li>my master, the elder ʿUbayd Allāh, to encourage him (the secretary) to draft a letter for me</li>
<li>and send it to me with the Master of the Shipmasts.</li>

<li>This is what I need the most from my master (the eparch).</li>
<li>In the days of his father, my master, the Master of the Horses, nobody opposed</li>
<li>me in anything. I am well respected and (request) that he goes to ask my honourable master (the eparch)</li>
<li>to treat me in the same way that his father treated me. Please be aware</li>
<li>that I pray sincerely and with kind gratitude that it (the letter)</li>
<li>will arrive safely. I have sent (this letter) to him with the Master of</li>
<li>the Shipmasts and we shall request him to pay one dīnār as cash commission</li>
<li>to my master the elder ʿUbayd Allāh. Greetings to you.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
