<li>In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The letter of the lieutenant Mashal Ankara, may God keep him safe, has reached me by</li>
<li>the hand of his servants. I dealt with their business and they departed. I did not write</li>
<li>a letter for them (to take) due to my many work commitments. Accept my apologies.</li>
<li>The gold ring has arrived. I have not sent you cash.</li>
<li>The lack of produce this year and the condition</li>
<li>of the people have not been concealed from you. No ship would have been sent this year,</li>
<li>had I not opened a store and sold to the people of your land.</li>
<li>I have sent the customs tax and logistic support.&nbsp;I have</li>
<li>written to the Master of the Horses (stating that) nobody should harm them</li>
<li>or obstruct them, but that he should protect them until they arrive,</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto - margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>for which they will be grateful, if God wills. Ḥajjāj,</li>
<li>the son of Misrad, has informed me that you want to come</li>
<li>and enter Aswan. If you want to enter,</li>
<li>you would be given a warm welcome.</li>
<li>Your kindness has come to my attention. May God reward you</li>
<li>and help me return the kindness to you.</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>God knows that I wish for only what is good for the land.</li>
<li>I have sent with the bearer of the letter a dyed garment in place of</li>
<li>the payment in cash. Please forgive me. And I have sent to Kanūna,</li>
<li>your wife, a bundle in which are five pieces of aloes-wood.</li>
<li>If you need anything, write and let me know about it, if God, the Mighty and Magnificent, wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone. His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
