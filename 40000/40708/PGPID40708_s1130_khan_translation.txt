Recto

In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.
The letter of the lieutenant Mashal Ankara, may God keep him safe, has reached me by
the hand of his servants. I dealt with their business and they departed. I did not write
a letter for them (to take) due to my many work commitments. Accept my apologies.
The gold ring has arrived. I have not sent you cash.
The lack of produce this year and the condition
of the people have not been concealed from you. No ship would have been sent this year,
had I not opened a store and sold to the people of your land.
I have sent the customs tax and logistic support. I have
written to the Master of the Horses (stating that) nobody should harm them
or obstruct them, but that he should protect them until they arrive,

for which they will be grateful, if God wills. Ḥajjāj,
the son of Misrad, has informed me that you want to come
and enter Aswan. If you want to enter,
you would be given a warm welcome.
Your kindness has come to my attention. May God reward you
and help me return the kindness to you.

God knows that I wish for only what is good for the land.
I have sent with the bearer of the letter a dyed garment in place of
the payment in cash. Please forgive me. And I have sent to Kanūna,
your wife, a bundle in which are five pieces of aloes-wood.
If you need anything, write and let me know about it, if God, the Mighty and Magnificent, wills.
Praise be to God alone. His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and His peace.
Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!
