<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I (write to) ask about your news, for it would make me happy to hear something of this that I would treasure. I request (to know)</li>
<li>whether you are in a good condition and in good health, for I am indeed so. I am longing (for you).</li>
<li>One who is abandoned after being connected, the thirsty man who yearns for cool water,</li>
<li>the mother of a young gazelle that has left her young, the ringed pigeon who has lost</li>
<li>her friend, none are more desirous than I am for my honourable master, my lord, may God prolong</li>
<li>his life and cause his strength, his exaltedness, his loftiness, his splendour, his elevation and his ascendance to endure,</li>
<li>crush his enviers and enemies, and not cause him to cease achieving glorious success.</li>
<li>May God bring us together in a most joyful state, through His generosity and benevolence, and His hidden kindness. He is able to do</li>
<li>this, if God, the Mighty and Exalted, wills.</li>
