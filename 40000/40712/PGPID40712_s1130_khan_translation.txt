In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
I (write to) ask about your news, for it would make me happy to hear something of this that I would treasure. I request (to know)
whether you are in a good condition and in good health, for I am indeed so. I am longing (for you).
One who is abandoned after being connected, the thirsty man who yearns for cool water,
the mother of a young gazelle that has left her young, the ringed pigeon who has lost
her friend, none are more desirous than I am for my honourable master, my lord, may God prolong
his life and cause his strength, his exaltedness, his loftiness, his splendour, his elevation and his ascendance to endure,
crush his enviers and enemies, and not cause him to cease achieving glorious success.
May God bring us together in a most joyful state, through His generosity and benevolence, and His hidden kindness. He is able to do
this, if God, the Mighty and Exalted, wills.
