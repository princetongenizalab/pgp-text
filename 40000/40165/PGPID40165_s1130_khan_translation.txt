Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
The letter of my son—may God prolong his life and causehis support, his happiness, his safety and wellbeing to endure —has arrived
and I have read it and noted its contents. I was pleased tohear that you are well and in good health. I have received
what you have graciously given me by the hand of yourcompanion ʾIbrāhīm. May I not be deprived of him or leftalone without him.
He should be rewarded. May there be many like himamong the people. I have sent a slave girl with
ʾIbrāhīm (as payment) for what is owed together with hertwo children. Forgive me (for the delay).
Let me know whatever you need. I know that I owe you adebt arising from the fact that
I sold the slave girl of my own accord (without consulting you) and (I know) what you have spoken about me. God willing,
I shall send her to you. Your two companions have seenmy messenger whom I sent in connection with
the slave (al-waṣīfa). Do not have any worries. All will bewell, God willing. She (the slave girl)
is a beauty who is like a jewel. The Master of the Horseskisses your honourable hand and makes a request to
your honour. What is requested from my lord is that youdo goodness and kindness to your slave (the Master of theHorses).His (i.e., of the Master of the Horses) two wives send theirbest wishes. You are always so kind.
