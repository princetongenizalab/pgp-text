<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The letter of my son&mdash;may God prolong his life and cause his support, his happiness, his safety and wellbeing to endure &mdash;has arrived</li>
<li>and I have read it and noted its contents. I was pleased to hear that you are well and in good health. I have received</li>
<li>what you have graciously given me by the hand of your companion Ibrāhīm. May I not be deprived of him or left alone without him.</li>
<li>He should be rewarded. May there be many like him among the people. I have sent a slave girl with</li>
<li>Ibrāhīm (as payment) for what is owed together with her two children. Forgive me (for the delay).</li>
<li>Let me know whatever you need. I know that I owe you a debt arising from the fact that</li>
<li>I sold the slave girl of my own accord (without consulting you) and (I know) what you have spoken about me. God willing,</li>
<li>I shall send her to you. Your two companions have seen my messenger whom I sent in connection with</li>
<li>the slave (al-waṣīfa). Do not have any worries. All will be well, God willing. She (the slave girl)</li>
<li>is a beauty who is like a jewel. The Master of the Horses kisses your honourable hand and makes a request to</li>
<li>your honour. What is requested from my lord is that you do goodness and kindness to your slave (the Master of the Horses).</li>
<li>His (i.e., of the Master of the Horses) two wives send their best wishes. You are always so kind.</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>Praise be to the One alone</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>

                        <ol>
<li>Do not be anxious about the lantern, which I sent to yourmother. She was on</li>
<li>a journey and she did not have it with her (and so could not send it to you). Everything will reach you as required and as is appropriate. A</li>
<li>fine lantern will be conveyed to you by her slave, God willing. Do not be concerned. I send you greetings.</li>
<li>I have given a slave girl to your companion ʾIbrāhīm who suits him well.</li>

<li>My honourable son, the elder ʾAbū al-Ṭāhir,</li>
<li>may God preserve his life and cause his safety and wellbeing to endure.</li>

<li>and vizier of the king, Uruwī, governor of the land of</li>
<li>Marīs.</li>
