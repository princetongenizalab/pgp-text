                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I inform my honourable master, the most illustrious elder, may God prolong his life and cause his strength,</li>
<li>his exaltedness, his ascendance, his splendour, his loftiness and his elevation to endure, and crush in vile humility</li>
<li>his enviers and enemies. As for other matters, I journeyed beyond</li>
<li>al-Marīs and arrived at Aswan. My horse was covered in dust (and exhausted).</li>
<li>All the people of al-Marīs have gathered and they are coming to you. I asked (them to allow me) to come with them</li>
<li>and all that has prevented me is the cost of the transport. It is not appropriate for me to go up (the river) and leave the cost of the transport</li>
<li>behind me (i.e., without paying it). Qāsim has arrived at your place and he had made an arrangement</li>
<li>with people that they should finish their business with me (and let me go), but they have still not finished their business with me. By God,</li>
<li>send me the piece (of cloth) and the clothing. Also a letter has come after me (i.e., has been sent after me) from home.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto - margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>Perhaps you could have ʿUmar or Khalīl or one of you to come to me in Aswan</li>
<li>with my goods that I have with my slave boy and (also come) to Fāris. If not, we shall manage.</li>
<li>They are all in Aswan.</li>
</ol>
