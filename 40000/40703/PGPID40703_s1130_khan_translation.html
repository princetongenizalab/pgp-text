                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I inform my honourable master, the most illustrious elder, may God prolong his life and cause his strength,</li>
<li>his exaltedness, his ascendance, his splendour, his loftiness and his elevation to endure, and crush in vile humility</li>
<li>his enviers and enemies. As for other matters, I journeyed beyond</li>
<li>al-Marīs and arrived at Aswan. My horse was covered in dust (and exhausted).</li>
<li>All the people of al-Marīs have gathered and they are coming to you. I asked (them to allow me) to come with them</li>
<li>and all that has prevented me is the cost of the transport. It is not appropriate for me to go up (the river) and leave the cost of the transport</li>
<li>behind me (i.e., without paying it). Qāsim has arrived at your place and he had made an arrangement</li>
<li>with people that they should finish their business with me (and let me go), but they have still not finished their business with me. By God,</li>
<li>send me the piece (of cloth) and the clothing. Also a letter has come after me (i.e., has been sent after me) from home.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto - margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>Perhaps you could have ʿUmar or Khalīl or one of you to come to me in Aswan</li>
<li>with my goods that I have with my slave boy and (also come) to Fāris. If not, we shall manage.</li>
<li>They are all in Aswan.</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>If you find somebody who will buy the helmet, the pen- knife, the three scabbards and the spear,</li>
<li>then sell them. For God&rsquo;s sake, encourage one of your group to come to me, for my horse is weak</li>
<li>and I cannot come to you. When you come down (the river), bring with you the slave girl to me.</li>
<li>Everything is fine. Do not listen to the talk of people and the rubbish (they speak). As for the freedman,</li>
<li>we brought him for the sake of the young girl. Do not leave him, but bring him with you.</li>
<li>As for the chain of gold coins that will be in the possession of the women, bring it with you. As for the saddle pads</li>
<li>that are with ʿAjlān the tanner, take them from him. By God, take for me the price of the five</li>
<li>portions, which are owed to me by the governor. Do not leave them. Take their price. By God,</li>
<li>convey (to me) half by means of the small slave .. [ ] quickly, quickly, quickly!</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>If none of you comes to me, I shall go.</li>
<li>Best wishes to you and likewise to all our companions.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet.</li>
<li>My sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
