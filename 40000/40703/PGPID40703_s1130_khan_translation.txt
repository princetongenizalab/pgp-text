Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate. 
I inform my honourable master, the most illustrious elder, may God prolong his life and cause his strength,
his exaltedness, his ascendance, his splendour, his loftiness and his elevation to endure, and crush in vile humility
his enviers and enemies. As for other matters, I journeyed beyond
al-Marīs and arrived at Aswan. My horse was covered in dust (and exhausted).
All the people of al-Marīs have gathered and they are coming to you. I asked (them to allow me) to come with them
and all that has prevented me is the cost of the transport. It is not appropriate for me to go up (the river) and leave the cost of the transport
behind me (i.e., without paying it). Qāsim has arrived at your place and he had made an arrangement
with people that they should finish their business with me (and let me go), but they have still not finished their business with me. By God,
send me the piece (of cloth) and the clothing. Also a letter has come after me (i.e., has been sent after me) from home.

Recto - margin

Perhaps you could have ʿUmar or Khalīl or one of you to come to me in Aswan
with my goods that I have with my slave boy and (also come) to Fāris. If not, we shall manage.
They are all in Aswan.
