                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I have written to you, my son, who is dear to me, the commander (at) Ibrīm, may God prolong your life and cause your strength,</li>
<li>your support, your happiness and your good health to endure. I am writing to you in a state of wellness and good health,</li>
<li>praise be to God for that. I inform you, my son, that I had sent you</li>
<li>the advance consignment immediately after asking the commander, Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla), may He cause his power to endure, (to dispatch it)</li>
<li>and he sent it with a reliable person indicating that he would meet ʿAbd al-Bāqī and deliver it to him.</li>
<li>He went on part of the way, but then returned, and it (the advance consignment) has remained with us until</li>
<li>this day. I have (now) sent it to you with ʿAbd al-Bāqī. It contains nine</li>
<li>raṭls. I hope I shall come and assign to you</li>
<li>nine and a half raṭls for a dīnār. I have sold the mattress for a dīnār and a half</li>
<li>and the two tunics for half a dīnār. This made a total of two dīnārs. I handed over to the fur merchant</li>
<li>three dīnārs and sent them to you. He took for himself the saffron for two dīnārs. He also took</li>
<li>for a dīnār a coloured luxury item, and I took for you civet perfume for two qīrāṭs. I took candles for a qīrāṭ.</li>
<li>I took for a qīrāṭ aloes and for two qīrāṭs saffron. I took for two qīrāṭs beads.</li>
<li>I took for a qīrāṭ and a half cinnamon. I took for a qīrāṭ sprigs and herbs, and a rope for binding a load</li>
<li>for a qīrāṭ and a half, and a sample, and a brass lock, a quarter of a dīnār, in the form of a small coin, beads,</li>
<li>a sixth of a dīnār. I paid to ʿAbd al-Bāqī a sixth of a dīnār apart from the fee for</li>
<li>the credit that would remain with you of an eighth of a dīnār. I wanted to inform you of this</li>
<li>so that you are aware of it. If you have any requests, write to him concerning them and they will be carried out. I pray to God</li>

                        <ol>
<li>that your children and your father are in good health. I have paid to him (ʿAbd al-Bāqī?)</li>
<li>through ʾAbū al-Ḥusayn, the coppersmith, the two tunics and the glass. I wanted to tell you</li>
<li>that I send you best wishes. My son sends you wishes.</li>
<li>Write to me if anything untoward comes up and you want some request to be carried out.</li>
<li>Indeed let me know so that I can deal with it. You ask concerning the straw-dealer called</li>
<li>Muslim &ldquo;Is my bed, which has gold in it, with him?&rdquo; I have been told that he has come</li>
<li>upon something lucrative. Best wishes. Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>

                        <ol>
<li>My son, who is dear to me, Abū l-Qāsim Hibat Allāh</li>
<li>ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Aʿmā,</li>
<li>may God prolong his life and cause his power and strength to endure.</li>
<li>From ʿAbd al-Karīm ibn al-Ḥasan</li>
<li>ibn Dāʾūd</li>
<li>to Ibrīm, if God wills.</li>
