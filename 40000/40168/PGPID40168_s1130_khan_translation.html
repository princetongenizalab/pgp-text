<li>In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The letter of the Master of the Horses and vizier of theking&mdash;may God prolong his life and cause</li>
<li>his strength, safety and guardianship to endure&mdash;has arrived, and I have taken note of it and am pleased with its arrival.</li>
<li>His slave boy, Bishr, arrived on Wednesday as I was leaving for the land of Nubia. I found in it (the letter)</li>
<li>that the Master of the Horses sent three dīnārs and I asked on your behalf for bitumen to be bought for you before</li>
<li>I left the land. I collected three dirhams commission in order for him to buy for him (i.e., the Master of the Horses) the bitumen.</li>
<li>When I left for the land of the Nubians on Wednesday, my colleague sent [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ]</li>
<li>to him twenty qīrāṭs in order to buy for him twenty [ &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ]</li>
<li>to him two water skins from me, in which the bitumen could be put, and I put [the bitumen in them]</li>
<li>and I loaded them on a ship of the purveyor of merchandise. By God, I was delighted</li>
<li>with his letter. Whatever request you have, write to me, and I shall carry it out</li>
<li>and perform my duty, whether it be small or large. May he (the Master of the Horses) not cease</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>to allow me to act as his agent in trade, to carry out hisneeds and for any service.</li>
<li>Praise be to him alone. May His blessings</li>
<li>be&mdash;if God, the Almighty and Exalted, wishes&mdash;</li>
<li>upon Muḥammad [and those who] succeeded him, andhis companions, and may He save (them), and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
