In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.
The letter of the Master of the Horses and vizier of theking—may God prolong his life and cause
his strength, safety and guardianship to endure—has arrived, and I have taken note of it and am pleased with its arrival.
His slave boy, Bishr, arrived on Wednesday as I was leavingfor the land of Nubia. I found in it (the letter)
that the Master of the Horses sent three dīnārs and I asked on your behalf for bitumen to be bought for you before
I left the land. I collected three dirhams commission in order for him to buy for him (i.e., the Master of the Horses) the bitumen.
When I left for the land of the Nubians on Wednesday, my colleague sent [       ]
to him twenty qīrāṭs in order to buy for him twenty [      ]
to him two water skins from me, in which the bitumen could be put, and I put [the bitumen in them]
and I loaded them on a ship of the purveyor of merchandise. By God, I was delighted
with his letter. Whatever request you have, write to me, and I shall carry it out
and perform my duty, whether it be small or large. May he (the Master of the Horses) not cease

to allow me to act as his agent in trade, to carry out hisneeds and for any service.
Praise be to him alone. May His blessings
be—if God, the Almighty and Exalted, wishes—
upon Muḥammad [and those who] succeeded him, andhis companions, and may He save (them), and His peace.
Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!

I ask forgiveness, since I have written this letter from Dendur. If I were in Aswan, I would have
sent him cash, so that trusting friendship may accompany what this (letter) says, if God wills.
