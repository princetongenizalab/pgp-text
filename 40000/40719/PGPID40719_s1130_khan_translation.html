<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>This is what Ghalyūn ibn Sulaymān al-Kanzī bought from</li>
<li>Fakhr ibn Furayj ibn Mīnā al-ʾIsamnāwī. He bought from him</li>
<li>with one clapping of the hands and one contract seven cubits,</li>
<li>(measured) in the cubit of the elbow, held in common, of all the land known as</li>
<li>Shabb Shalūl in the east opposite the village known</li>
<li>as Murwā. Its southern boundary extends to a piece of land known (by the name) of the aforementioned purchaser</li>
<li>recently. Its northern boundary extends to the house</li>
<li>of ʿAwn and Muḥammad and ʿUbayd Allāh, the sons of ʿAbd Allāh ibn Maʿbad, and their partners.</li>
<li>The eastern boundary extends to the desert. The western boundary extends</li>
<li>to the Nile. This includes all its rights, small and big, and the right to drink,</li>
<li>namely from its water well, by which it is irrigated, and every right relating to</li>
<li>to what is inside it, and every right relating to what is outside it; and the passage to</li>
<li>all of it safely is included in its rights. (He bought it) for one dīnār, of standard weight,</li>
<li>of gold, in minted coin, valid full weight, according to the Egyptian weight of al-Ḥāfiẓ,</li>
<li>of good alloy; a purchase without a condition that would invalidate it or a promise</li>
<li>that would make it void. He received it from him and took possession of it and it passed into his hand,</li>
<li>his ownership, his possession and his property, by the aforementioned purchase.</li>
<li>He delivered to him the aforementioned price, with its specified weight, and he released him</li>
<li>from that, a release of receipt in full, according to the requirements of the condition</li>
<li>of sale of the Muslims, and their warranties and stipulations, with an operative, effective</li>
<li>and valid sale; after the two had reached agreement and taken</li>
<li>upon themselves its obligation, and put it into effect, while in sound mind</li>
<li>and body, legally capable of conducting their affairs, acting willingly, not forced.</li>
<li>This was in the first ten days of the month of Rajab, the year five-hundred and thirty-five (February 1141 AD).</li>
</ol>
