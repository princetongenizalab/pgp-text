<li>bought. She is free to dispose of it or of whatever she wants of it in the</li>
<li>way that owners are free to dispose of their property, without anybody</li>
<li>preventing or obstructing. This was after they had inspected (the house)</li>
<li>and separated from one another physically. Whatever claim relating to</li>
<li>fault in ownership is made against them in respect of what</li>
<li>33. the contract of the aforementioned sale entailed by any other people, this</li>

<li>be owed, by way of returning a price, or vouching</li>
<li>34. for a value, and the handing over of anything whatsoever, little or much,</li>
<li>with the fullest warranties, and the most valid, complete, and secure guarantees,</li>
<li>for the sake of this sale and warranty against a claim described</li>

<li>half of the house, and he has a document with the status of</li>
<li>a primary document (i.e. a certificate of his original ownership), and on</li>
<li>the verso of each of them was written an acknowledgement of this sale,</li>
<li>its date being the date of this document and its witnesses being</li>
<li>36. its witnesses, and the buyer for the person named (herein) received them</li>
<li>both and they came into his hand as a proof for him and a security for</li>
<li>today and for the future. The acknowledgment of the transacting parties</li>
<li>of what is in it was witnessed. It was written on the first day of Rabīʿ ii,</li>
<li>37. in the year five hundred and fifty-three (5 May, 1158 ce). It contains corrections,</li>
<li>including the following, which have been written (in the docan</li>
<li>arabic document of sale from medieval cairo 145</li>
<li>ument): ‘al-Faraj’, ‘conduit’, ‘on the right of somebody who has entered</li>
<li>from the door of the living room’, ‘under it’, ‘for looking’, ‘on the left of one</li>
<li>entering it’ and ‘beginning’.</li>
<li>38. This is correct. It was written by Futūḥ ibn ʿAlī. This buyer is aware of</li>
<li>the fact that this house has cracked walls, is of unstable structure, is neglected,</li>
<li>and some of its walls are built with brick and wood, and that</li>
<li>39. it cannot be used except after demolishing them and rebuilding them,</li>
<li>and he (the buyer) released the seller, with permission of the woman for</li>
<li>whom it was bought, from the (liability of) all the faults with a decisive</li>
<li>release for today and thereafter. This was witnessed on the date (it was</li>
<li>written).</li>
