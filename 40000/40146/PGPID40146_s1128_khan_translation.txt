32. and his ownership, part of the property of the woman for whom it was

both and they came into his hand as a proof for him and a security for
today and for the future. The acknowledgment of the transacting parties
of what is in it was witnessed. It was written on the first day of Rabīʿ ii,
37. in the year five hundred and fifty-three (5 May, 1158 ce). It contains corrections,
including the following, which have been written (in the docan

from the door of the living room’, ‘under it’, ‘for looking’, ‘on the left of one
entering it’ and ‘beginning’.

and he (the buyer) released the seller, with permission of the woman for
whom it was bought, from the (liability of) all the faults with a decisive
release for today and thereafter. This was witnessed on the date (it was
written).
