The opening of the heart. Write and wash off with water,


and in the same water you should knead a dough of barley,


and make three cakes from it,


and eat from them every day, a cake a day,


before studying. This is what you should write:


(1:6-8) (magic names)

 
 

[For love.]


Take a leaf of a fig tree, write on it, immerse


it in water, and let both of them drink from it. This is what


you should write: (magic names),


I adjure you,


you, holy angels, that you should give


love for N born of N in the heart of N born of N. If you cannot let them drink it,


pour it over the road through which they are about to walk.

(For) opening of the heart.


Take a new bowl and write


for 3 days, every day these names,


wash it with water, and drink.


This is what you should write:


(2:6-8) (magic names)

 
 

For hate.


Write on an egg laid on the same day, immerse it


in water, pour it over the road


where they are about to pass. This is


what you should write:


(2:13-14) (magic names).


I adjure you, you


demons and idols with that of which you fear, that you should place


hatred, enmity and strife between N and N, Amen, Amen, Selah.


(2:between lines 1 and 2) “Happy is the man that does not take the wicked for his guide, nor walk the road that sinners tread, [nor take his] seat…” (Ps 1:1).
(2:in the margin above) … “The Lord has laid on another the consequences of your sin. / You shall not die” (2Sam 12:13).
