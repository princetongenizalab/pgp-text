                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the Ikshīl and Master of the Horses, the vizier of the king&mdash;may God prolong his life</li>
<li>and cause his support, protection, safety and wellbeing to endure&mdash;that the bearer of it (this letter?)1 is my</li>
<li>loyal and respectful companion, Oua, who is my servant. I have sent him with my slave boy Mārīkhura.</li>
<li>He came to me on his travels. Please treat him well and correctly and provide him with his requirements,</li>
<li>and I shall reckon it as my debt and that of my companions. As for the news, God</li>
<li>has protected us from the evil of Shāwar and he has been killed by the hand of Shīrkūh, the military commander, may God protect him, and he (Shīrkūh) has taken on the viziership to bear the burden</li>
<li>of evil that is to come. He (Shīrkūh) has summoned the commander to him, and the commander is determined</li>
<li>to travel to Egypt for the sake of his (Shīrkūh's) expeditions and his aid, while I am staying in the country (of Nubia).</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>If you have any need, write to me and let me know</li>
<li>about it, if God, the Exalted and Majestic, wills it.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
