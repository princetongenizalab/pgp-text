<li>
<p>[Whoever defies an act of obligatory practice, or a ritual from the rituals of Islam, or refuses from fulfilling his obligation to the rightful]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people, by virtue of denying the obligation or rejecting it, warrants his killing, and punitive measures being appointed against him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when possible, unless he repents and seeks forgiveness.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And everyone who obstructs the implementation of one of the legal punishments (ḥudūd)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of God, it is obligatory to wage jihād against him. As for bandits (luṣūṣ), if they attack the property&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of Muslims, it is obligatory to wage jihād against them, prevent them from infringing it, and kill them against this pretext. Whoever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is killed defending his own wealth or that of another Muslim is a martyr (shahīd). However,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[if he refrains from defending his own property and surrenders without resisting], there is no blame upon him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[As for the stolen property recovered from the bandits; if they are captured, then its return depends: if the owners are known, it is repatriated to them; if the owners are unknown, it is to be delivered to the Imām.]</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>[The apostates (ahl al-ridda) are to be killed. In a situation where their womenfolk commit apostasy and are confined to a place,]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the men are to be killed and the women and children are to be held in captivity.  They should later be subjected to the division of spoils. When</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the women and men have apostasized and are in a city where there is a Muslim population, the men are to be killed, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the women imprisoned, and the children held until they reach the age of puberty. Whoever among them embraces Islam is </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>free; and if they do not embrace Islam, the men are to be killed and the women imprisoned. If only the men apostatize</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the women refrain, the men are to be killed, and the children retain the Muslim status of their mothers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> if they embrace Islam. [The heretics (zanādiqa) are to be called to seek forgiveness, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and if they fail to do so, they are to be killed and burned with fire after execution].</p>

                        <p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>[The sale of foodstuffs is not permitted unless the commodities have been delivered in full. However, it is permitted to sell them [before their full delivery] without a profit (tawliya), and the same ruling applies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>] to all commodities. It is permitted to purchase foodstuffs, and the </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>buyer shall make his purchase once he has validated the weight of the </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seller’s measurement (kayl al-bāyiʿ). The practice of iḥtikār (hoarding) is prohibited when food becomes scarce, and the practice of price-fixing (tasʿīr) has also been prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usury (ribā) is also forbidden and there is a severe censure regarding it. This applies to anyone who engages in it deliberately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for one who repents from it, he may take back only his capital, and the excess (al-faḍl) must be returned</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>if both parties agree to it, and there is no objection. Whoever advances (aslaf) dirhams or dinars [as a loan], </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and is then repaid in better (i.e., newer or higher quality) coins, there is no objection—provided that this was not stipulated in advance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also no objection to exchanging unequal amounts (tafāḍul) between different types [of commodities] if they are of different kinds. Wheat (al-burr) and barley (al-shaʿīr) are, however, considered a single </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>type (nawʿ wāḥid), and it is therefore not permissible to exchange them with disparity. The same applies to wheat (ḥinṭa), </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flour (daqīq), and groats (sawīq). It is disliked (yukrahu) to sell fresh dates (ruṭab) for dried dates (thamar).</p>
