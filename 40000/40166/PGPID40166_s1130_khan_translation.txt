Recto

 and may (God) destroy his enemy and opponent [ ] my Lord, that [the letter of
the Master of] the Shipmasts has reached me. He says to me that he will take for me from you three garments. Hehas taken
[ ] two garments in your name. The Master of the Shipmasts has received them. They (i.e., the staff of the Muslim merchant?) are working together with
the people of the land in an excellent collaboration. As for the seeds of wheat, I have delivered to your slave
six irdabbs minus a third without any waste (i.e., of good quality). Your slave boy has received them. These garments are
for you. The lieutenant has nothing (from me). My master, the debt of the people has risen by three
measures. As for the Qūsa clan of Darmus, when they showed favour to al-Qirṭimī, they granted him his right
in the days of his father. When he received his mandate,my father reinstated the payment of two waybas of wheat and many garments.
This is what is customary. Master, the bearer of this letter will do you good service.
When another man came (to me), I shunned him. This man, however, is my companion. He is
an excellent man. Ask him what I did with him when he came to me. My master, I shall request the presence of anybody
who comes in your name out of respect for you. Your slave (i.e., the writer) kisses your hand and legs,
and warmly welcomes a letter from your honour. Praise be to God alone.

Verso

Whatever it may be (that you need), I shall hasten to en-sure that people take it and come to you, and I shall send it—they will do it.
I shall write to keep you informed. I am your slave in theland.
