<li>&nbsp;and may (God) destroy his enemy and opponent [ ] myLord, that [the letter of</li>
<li>the Master of] the Shipmasts has reached me. He says tome that he will take for me from you three garments. Hehas taken</li>
<li>[ ] two garments in your name. The Master of the Ship-masts has received them. They (i.e., the staff of the Muslim merchant?) are working together with</li>
<li>the people of the land in an excellent collaboration. As forthe seeds of wheat, I have delivered to your slave</li>
<li>six irdabbs minus a third without any waste (i.e., of good quality). Your slave boy has received them. These garments are</li>
<li>for you. The lieutenant has nothing (from me). My master, the debt of the people has risen by three</li>
<li>measures. As for the Qūsa clan of Darmus, when theyshowed favour to al-Qirṭimī, they granted him his right</li>
<li>in the days of his father. When he received his mandate,my father reinstated the payment of two waybas of wheat and many garments.</li>
<li>This is what is customary. Master, the bearer of this letter will do you good service.</li>
<li>When another man came (to me), I shunned him. Thisman, however, is my companion. He is</li>
<li>an excellent man. Ask him what I did with him when hecame to me. My master, I shall request the presence ofanybody</li>
<li>who comes in your name out of respect for you. Yourslave (i.e., the writer) kisses your hand and legs,</li>
<li>and warmly welcomes a letter from your honour. Praisebe to God alone.</li>
