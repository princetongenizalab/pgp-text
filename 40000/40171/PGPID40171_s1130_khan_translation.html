                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The slave of my honourable lord, the Iksh카l and vizier of the king&mdash;may God prolong his life and cause his support,</li>
<li>his elevation, his loftiness, his magnificence and his power to endure, and suppress his haters and his enemies&mdash;the slave</li>
<li>kisses the ground and what he wishes him to know is that Merki says, &ldquo;I shall send the muzzles immediately.</li>
<li>I shall make all of the slaves of the Master of the Horses grateful (for the service, since) I shall send the muzzles immediately.&rdquo; We said</li>
<li>to him, &ldquo;May God keep the king and his vizier alive. May God not bring upon them or upon us any evil.&rdquo; He said,</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our star will rise soon, if God wills.&rdquo; When they heard (i.e., it was heard) that the Nubians had rebelled against</li>
<li>the king, he (Merki) killed them (i.e., the Nubian rebels) and said, &ldquo;The slaves of the Master of the Horses who are in this land&mdash;wherever</li>
<li>they have a place, they enter into it.&rdquo; He entered Aswan and gathered the slaves of Darm훮 (i.e., those in Darm훮's service)</li>
<li>and brought me to them and said to me that &ldquo;the Master of the Horses has ordered me to take over the administrative office.&rdquo;</li>
<li>I said to him, &ldquo;Who has endowed you with the office before I come to take over from you the office?&rdquo;</li>
<li>But he persisted. Everything that he said to me is in this letter. He decided to come to you, when he heard</li>
<li>that I wanted to plunder his house. He was afraid and came to you. Do not accept (anything) from him. I am not</li>
<li>owed by him what is needed with regard to the five head of horses. Whatever you want, do not accept</li>
<li>from him anything until I come and take a stand against him. What he says is not old.</li>
<li>He has only spoken (these things) in recent times. What is new was something old,10 but it was only</li>
<li>in these last two months. If you command me, I shall finish (my business here) and come (to you). Write and let me know. If you would like to tell me</li>
<li>to come to you and return, write and let me know. The bearer of this letter has brought you the full report.</li>
<li>When he is present (with you), ask him about your horses. I am only waiting for the reply to this letter.</li>
