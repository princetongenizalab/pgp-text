In the name of God [                ]  at a moment favoured by God
a son was born to Elʿazar ha-Levi b. Ḥalfon
ha-Levi b. Neḥamʾel ha-Levi, may his soul rest, whose name is David
ha-Levi. May our God make him a blessing
on earth [cf. Isa 19:24]. Amen.        On Sunday,
<of the month M> the 14th of the month
Marḥeshvan, with uncertainty, of the year one thousand
and five hundred of the Era of the Documents. Salvation
shall come [cf. Isa 56:1]. Amen. And the sign is 1500.
