<li>You have asked:</li>
<li>A little girl was married off by her mother and brother without her father's knowledge, and her father returned from abroad</li>
<li>and did not protest. The father took the bridegroom as a (business) partner and said to him:</li>
<li>'You are my son.' And anyone who asks him about him says to him: 'He is my son-in-law and the husband</li>
<li>of my daughter.' They stayed this way for about a year. After that, there was a dispute between them.&nbsp;He (the father) said to him:</li>
<li>'You don't have a wife with me, my daughter is still underaged, and so, she is under my authority. I did not</li>
<li>accept a betrothal for her from you, as the Talmudic sages said: "Her father receives her marriage" and</li>
<li>"Her father receives her divorce". He (the groom) said to him: 'Haven't I been with you for a year, and you did not consent?'</li>
