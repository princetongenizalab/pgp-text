A little girl was married off by her mother and brother without her father's knowledge, and her father returned from abroad
and did not protest. The father took the bridegroom as a (business) partner and said to him:
'You are my son.' And anyone who asks him about him says to him: 'He is my son-in-law and the husband
of my daughter.' They stayed this way for about a year. After that, there was a dispute between them. He (the father) said to him:
'You don't have a wife with me, my daughter is still underaged, and so, she is under my authority. I did not
accept a betrothal for her from you, as the Talmudic sages said: "Her father receives her marriage" and
"Her father receives her divorce". He (the groom) said to him: 'Haven't I been with you for a year, and you did not consent?'
