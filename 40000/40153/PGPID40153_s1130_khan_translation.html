<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The letter has arrived from the Ikshīl and the Master of the Horses, may God prolong his life, cause his</li>
<li>power to endure and crush his enemy. I have taken note of it and the fact that he stated that he</li>
<li>has sent to me a female slave, and has sent to me a slave girl with Jawhar,</li>
<li>and that I have only been able to send to him two turbans with difficulty and a seat. As for</li>
<li>the first (i.e., the aforementioned) female slave, she has not reached me in his consignment so that I may take possession of her, my honour,</li>
<li>Master of the Horses, and I shall not correspond with you nor give you consignments</li>
<li>of cloth as gifts until what you send is at my disposal. I seek</li>
<li>only the wellbeing of the land. God has not made me needful of you nor of</li>
<li>anybody else. God has provided for me. I only seek the wellbeing of the land and not</li>

                        <ol>
<li>anything else. I wrote to you</li>
<li>concerning the condition of my slaves but you did not reply. Then</li>
<li>I wrote to you concerning the condition of the two slaves</li>
<li>who are to be sent to my creditor</li>
<li>ʾAbū al-Ḍubāʿ, but you have not sent them</li>
<li>to me and I do not know whether your servant has given us a share,</li>

<li>and I have sent my slave boy Mārīḵura. Deliver to him</li>
<li>the two slaves who are for ʾAbū al-Ḍubāʿ. The commander Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla) arrived</li>
<li>after victory, slaughter and God&rsquo;s victory. Your response will arrive (soon),</li>
<li>if God wills. If you need anything, then of course (take) from the goods conveyed by my slave boy</li>
<li>Mārīkhura, if God, the Mighty and Glorious, wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone and His blessings on our lord Muḥammad, our prophet, and His peace.</li>
<li>Let the people go down (the river) without fear. We have released the people.</li>
<li>After the commander arrived, all was well.</li>
