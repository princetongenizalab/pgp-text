Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
The letter has arrived from the Ikshīl and the Master of the Horses, may God prolong his life, cause his
power to endure and crush his enemy. I have taken note of it and the fact that he stated that he
has sent to me a female slave, and has sent to me a slave girl with Jawhar,
and that I have only been able to send to him two turbans with difficulty and a seat. As for
the first (i.e., the aforementioned) female slave, she has not reached me in his consignment so that I may take possession of her, my honour,
Master of the Horses, and I shall not correspond with you nor give you consignments
of cloth as gifts until what you send is at my disposal. I seek
only the wellbeing of the land. God has not made me needful of you nor of
anybody else. God has provided for me. I only seek the wellbeing of the land and not

and I have sent my slave boy Mārīḵura. Deliver to him
the two slaves who are for ʾAbū al-Ḍubāʿ. The commander Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla) arrived
after victory, slaughter and God’s victory. Your response will arrive (soon),
if God wills. If you need anything, then of course (take) from the goods conveyed by my slave boy
Mārīkhura, if God, the Mighty and Glorious, wills.
Praise be to God alone and His blessings on our lord Muḥammad, our prophet, and His peace.
Let the people go down (the river) without fear. We have released the people.
After the commander arrived, all was well.
