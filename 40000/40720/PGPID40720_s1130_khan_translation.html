<li>Merki ibn Abrām, the freedman of the rightly-guided, prosperous, just judge, Trust of the Kingdom,</li>
<li>who is named on the recto, called me to witness that he has received in full a debt that he has from ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Ḥasan,</li>
<li>who is named on the recto, in that he, the aforementioned ʿUbayd Allāh, paid a quarter of a dīnār and an eighth of gold,</li>
<li>in coins of full weight, of al-ʾĀmir. The aforementioned (Merki) released the aforementioned ʿUbayd Allāh, ⟦the debtor⟧, who expressed his thanks,</li>
<li>a release of receipt in full. It was written by Muḥammad ibn Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī in his hand, in the</li>
<li>last ten days of the month of Ramaḍān of the year five- hundred and sixteen (23rd November&ndash;2nd December 1122 AD).</li>
<li>Merki ibn Abrām, the freedman of the rightly-guided, prosperous, just judge, Trust of the Kingdom, ʾAbū al-Ḵayr ʾIbrāhīm ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥusayn</li>
<li>ibn al-Zubayr, asked me to testify with regard to himself, while he was in health, while his acts were legal, and he acted willingly, that he has received in full from ʿAbd Allāh, a freedman, substituting for his father,</li>
<li>a quarter, a sixth and an eighth of a dīnār, in gold coinage of al-ʾĀmir, full weight, of good alloy, on behalf of his debtor ʿUbayd Allāh ibn Ḥasan,</li>
<li>who is named on the recto; and he released him from that with a release of full receipt; and that the remainder that is owed to him by his debtor is a quarter and two sixths</li>
<li>of a dīnār, in cash. It was written by ʿAlī ibn ʿ Ubayd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Turkī in his own hand, in the last ten days</li>
<li>of Shawwāl, in the year five-hundred and sixteen (22nd&ndash;31st December 1122 AD). That was after he had received a legal injunction against him for the remainder, which was written by ʿAbd Allāh</li>
<li>ibn Muḥammad ibn Tawfīq ibn Ḥusayn in the last ten days of Shawwāl of the year five-hundred and sixteen (22nd&ndash;31st December 1122 AD). He wrote with his own hand.</li>
<li>His receipt of the legal injunction against him was by means of a full, ratifying oath sworn by God, other than whom there is no other God. He received it in the way</li>
<li>that other Muslims like him swear (oathes), in Shawwāl of the year five-hundred and sixteen (December 1122 AD). He wrote with his own hand.</li>
<li>Everything that Merki ibn Abrām asked the witness whose writing is above</li>
<li>this writing of mine to witness he made me (also) witness, and I was present at the receipt of the injunction against him (i.e., against the debtor), the ratifying oath,</li>
<li>as such similar (oaths) are sworn. This was in Shawwāl of the year five-hundred and sixteen (December 1122 AD).</li>
<li>It was written by Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn ʾIbrāhīm al-ʾAnṭākī on its date.</li>
