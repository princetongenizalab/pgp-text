(the ruler), may God strengthen his victory [ ] reign over the free and whose pride and happiness must be established.
If the ruler, may God strengthen his victory, has validly received their poll-tax, through the services of the Pride of the Arabs, Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla), may God cause his elevation to endure,
he knows what the ruler, may God strengthen his victory, has undertaken to support the livelihood of the two from the one who sold them and
the ruler’s son, the exalted, glorious, noble, rightly-guided and powerful presence, who safeguarded their return, gathered (funds) for supporting their families that could be lived off. Indeed I can
do what is appropriate concerning it and with regard to their return. My lord has decried the fact that they have been blamed by their seller and left to themselves.
Let me know what your preference is regarding them, now that they are free. He knows that they experienced being former captives, taken to the
dusty land of Nubia for years, then (were captives) in the land of Islam for a long period. He has submitted to God and His safety. May he (the addressee) undertake this
and what is appropriate and customary, with our thanks and out of respect for the sons of the sharīf in our district.
If he brings it, it will arrive. If my messenger delays sending what should be sent, do not omit to send me a letter containing the mention
of your news and your other needs, so I can fulfil your wishes in that regard, God willing.
Praise be to God alone and His blessings upon the sanctity of those whom he has created, Muḥammad, His Prophet, and his pure family, and His peace.
Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!
