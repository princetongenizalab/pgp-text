<li>(the ruler), may God strengthen his victory [ ] reign over the free and whose pride and happiness must be established.</li>
<li>If the ruler, may God strengthen his victory, has validly received their poll-tax, through the services of the Pride of the Arabs, Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla), may God cause his elevation to endure,</li>
<li>he knows what the ruler, may God strengthen his victory, has undertaken to support the livelihood of the two from the one who sold them and</li>
<li>the ruler&rsquo;s son, the exalted, glorious, noble, rightly-guided and powerful presence, who safeguarded their return, gathered (funds) for supporting their families that could be lived off. Indeed I can</li>
<li>do what is appropriate concerning it and with regard to their return. My lord has decried the fact that they have been blamed by their seller and left to themselves.</li>
<li>Let me know what your preference is regarding them, now that they are free. He knows that they experienced being former captives, taken to the</li>
<li>dusty land of Nubia for years, then (were captives) in the land of Islam for a long period. He has submitted to God and His safety. May he (the addressee) undertake this</li>
<li>and what is appropriate and customary, with our thanks and out of respect for the sons of the sharīf in our district.</li>
<li>If he brings it, it will arrive. If my messenger delays sending what should be sent, do not omit to send me a letter containing the mention</li>
<li>of your news and your other needs, so I can fulfil your wishes in that regard, God willing.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone and His blessings upon the sanctity of those whom he has created, Muḥammad, His Prophet, and his pure family, and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
