Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
I inform the Ikshīl, master of the horses, vizier of the king—may God prolong his life
and cause his protection and wellbeing to endure—that the leader Saʿāda has set off (to him) on the ship
travelling to (meet) him. What I would like to request from the Ikshīl is to give him the status
of the people belonging to my slaves that have been granted freedom, like
my other freedmen and slaves. The Ikshīl cannot show them opposition in anything small
or big, but should show honour to the aforementioned leader and care for him and for his companions who are travelling with him.
So may his (the Ikshīl’s) letter be dispatched to me with (instructions) for me to execute for his sake, for I am ready to execute that for him. I am grateful to him for this,

Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and peace.
Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!
