                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the Ikshīl, Master of the Horses, vizier of the king&mdash;may God prolong his life</li>
<li>and cause his protection and wellbeing to endure&mdash;that the leader Saʿāda has set off (to him) on the ship</li>
<li>travelling to (meet) him. What I would like to request from the Ik&scaron;īl is to give him the status</li>
<li>of the people belonging to my slaves that have been granted freedom, like</li>
<li>my other freedmen and slaves. The Ikshīl cannot show them opposition in anything small</li>
<li>or big, but should show honour to the aforementioned leader and care for him and for his companions who are travelling with him.</li>
<li>So may his (the Ikshīl&rsquo;s) letter be dispatched to me with (instructions) for me to execute for his sake, for I am ready to execute that for him. I am grateful to him for this,</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>if God wills, the Mighty and Magnificent</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>

<li>From the sincere commander, the blissful, the powerful arm of the caliphate,</li>
<li>the Victory of the Kingship, Crown of the Dynasty, Pride of the Arabs,</li>
<li>Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla) and its support, protector of sailors, the Sword</li>
