Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
I inform the Ikshīl, the Master of the Horses, the vizier of the king—may God prolong his life,
and cause his protection and wellbeing to endure—that his letter to me has referred to
the condition of the travellers from the boats and of others and that he has striven to ameliorate
this situation and the lofty, most glorious and munificent presence, may God establish his happiness, has graciously
released the boats, in the knowledge of what the country is undergoing
with regard to the rising of prices, for the travellers have experienced hardship and (the prices) have risen
to the disadvantage of the merchants, so that they have acquired goods at high prices.
The Ikshīl, therefore, needs to protect them and care for them in accordance with
their rights, and all the more so since they belong to those whose right (to protection) is obligatory and the service of whom is a compulsory requirement.

The bearer (of this letter), the leader Saʿāda, may God decree his abundant
good health, the relative of the noble leader, Hero of the Dynasty,
Ḥāmid, may God decree for him abundant good health, has departed. The Ikshīl
knows what is required with regard to the restraint of his (the Ikshīl’s) companions and the imposition upon them of obligations
and the prevention of those who oppose him (Saʿāda) with harm and damage
or a clerk who hinders him (Saʿāda) with regard to

pricing or anything else. I have been motivated (to write) this only by my obligation for the sake of the Master
of the Horses and my intention, as witnessed by God, to draw the hearts of all the people
to him, so that this is not hidden from him. So, please arrange for his (the eparch’s) letter to be sent to me with authorisation for me to offer the leader Saʿāda
respectful treatment until it (his work) is finished, for which I would be grateful, if God, the Powerful and Glorious, wills. His reply [    ]
would ensure that he would be treated justly in these matters through me by his (the eparch’s) slaves and servants, if God, the Powerful and Glorious, wills.
Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and peace.
Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!

may God cause his health, his protection and his wellbeing to endure.
