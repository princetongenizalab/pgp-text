                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the Ikshīl, the Master of the Horses, the vizier of the king&mdash;may God prolong his life,</li>
<li>and cause his protection and wellbeing to endure&mdash;that his letter to me has referred to</li>
<li>the condition of the travellers from the boats and of others and that he has striven to ameliorate</li>
<li>this situation and the lofty, most glorious and munificent presence, may God establish his happiness, has graciously</li>
<li>released the boats,&nbsp;in the knowledge of what the country is undergoing</li>
<li>with regard to the rising of prices, for the travellers have experienced hardship and (the prices) have risen</li>
<li>to the disadvantage of the merchants, so that they have acquired goods at high prices.</li>
<li>The Ikshīl, therefore, needs to protect them and care for them in accordance with</li>
<li>their rights, and all the more so since they belong to those whose right (to protection) is obligatory and the service of whom is a compulsory requirement.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right margin</h3>

<li>The bearer (of this letter), the leader Saʿāda, may God decree his abundant</li>
<li>good health, the relative of the noble leader, Hero of the Dynasty,</li>
<li>Ḥāmid, may God decree for him abundant good health, has departed. The Ikshīl</li>
<li>knows what is required with regard to the restraint of his (the Ikshīl&rsquo;s) companions and the imposition upon them of obligations</li>
<li>and the prevention of those who oppose him (Saʿāda) with harm and damage</li>
<li>or a clerk who hinders him (Saʿāda) with regard to</li>

<li>pricing or anything else. I have been motivated (to write) this only by my obligation for the sake of the Master</li>
<li>of the Horses and my intention, as witnessed by God, to draw the hearts of all the people</li>
<li>to him, so that this is not hidden from him. So, please arrange for his (the eparch&rsquo;s) letter to be sent to me with authorisation&nbsp;for me to offer the leader Saʿāda</li>
<li>respectful treatment until it (his work) is finished, for which I would be grateful, if God, the Powerful and Glorious, wills. His reply [&nbsp; &nbsp; ]</li>
<li>would ensure that he would be treated justly in these matters through me by his (the eparch&rsquo;s) slaves and servants, if God, the Powerful and Glorious, wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>

<li>To the Ikshīl, Master of the Horses, vizier of the king,</li>
<li>Uruwī ibn Khiyākh, the deputy of the king in the citadel of Ibrīm,</li>
<li>may God cause his health, his protection and his wellbeing to endure.</li>
