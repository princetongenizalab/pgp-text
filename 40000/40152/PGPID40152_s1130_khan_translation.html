                        <p><i>Recto</i></p>
<p><i>1. In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</i></p>
<p><i>2. </i><i>I inform the Ikšīl, the Master of the Horses, the vizier of</i></p>
<p><i>the king—may God prolong his life,</i></p>
<p><i>3. and cause his protection and wellbeing to endure—that</i></p>
<p><i>his letter to me has referred to</i></p>
<p><i>4. the condition of the travellers from the boats and of others</i></p>
<p><i>and that he has striven to ameliorate</i></p>
<p><i>5. this situation and the lofty, most glorious and munificent</i></p>
<p><i>presence, may God establish his happiness, has graciously</i></p>
<p><i>6. released the boats,</i><i>1 </i><i>in the knowledge of what the country</i></p>
<p><i>is undergoing</i></p>
<p><i>7. with regard to the rising of prices, for the travellers have</i></p>
<p><i>experienced hardship and (the prices) have risen</i></p>
<p><i>8. to the disadvantage of the merchants, so that they have</i></p>
<p><i>acquired goods at high prices.</i></p>
<p><i>1 </i><i>This is apparently an allusion to the eparch’s </i><i>intervention to alleviate</i></p>
<p><i>an economic crisis by granting permission for the shipment of supplies.</i></p>

<p><i>9. </i><i>The Ikšīl, therefore, needs to protect them and care for</i></p>
<p><i>them in accordance with</i></p>
<p><i>10. their rights, and all the more so since they belong to those</i></p>
<p><i>whose right (to protection) is obligatory and the service of</i></p>
<p><i>whom is a compulsory requirement.</i></p>

<p><i>1. The bearer (of this letter)</i><i>, the leader Saʿāda</i><i>, may God decree</i></p>

<p><i>2. of the Horses and my intention, as witnessed by God, to</i></p>
<p><i>draw the hearts of all the people</i></p>
<p><i>3. to him, so that this is not hidden from him. So, please arrange</i></p>
<p><i>for his </i><i>(the eparch’s) </i><i>letter to be sent to me with</i></p>
<p><i>authorisation </i><i>for me to offer the leader Saʿāda</i></p>
<p><i>Document 3 </i><i>307</i></p>
<p><i>4. respectful treatment until it (his work) is finished, for</i></p>
<p><i>which I would be grateful, if God, the Powerful and Glorious,</i></p>
