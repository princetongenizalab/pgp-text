In [your name, o Merciful]
The slave kisses the hands of our master the great
Nasi - may his glory be lofty - and asks him to accept
his apology and relieve him of the matter of the testimony,
for the master - may God crown us with his long life -
knows best [what is happening in] these times. May his peace increase.Â
