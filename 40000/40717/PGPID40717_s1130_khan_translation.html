<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>This is what the two elders, the notable Guardian of the Dynasty ʾAbū al-ʿUmar Hibat Allāh ibn al-Ḥasan ibn ʾIbrāhīm ibn Ṭalʿa, and the dignitary Glory of the Dynasty</li>
<li>ʾAbū al-Ḥusayn ʿAlī ibn ʾIbrāhīm ibn ʿAlī ibn Nahray, the two certified witnesses in the border town of Aswan, hired from Sirāj ibn Mario, the Christian,</li>
<li>al-Muqurrī. They hired from him with their money, for themselves, all of the &lsquo;gliding&rsquo; boat, made of acacia wood and Theban palm wood,1 the capacity</li>
<li>of its load being one hundred and fifty irdabbs, with a sail, the upper part of which is coarse cloth, a mast with a saddle, an awning, a deck shelf, four</li>
<li>oars, an iron anchor, which is made fast with rope, all that such boats need in the way of equipment. (They hired the boat) for the purpose of loading (and transporting) goods to</li>
<li>the border of the region where Muslims have the right to travel (al-islāmiyya), travelling up- and downstream, from the coast of Bilāq to the Island of Michael in the Land of the Nubians, in a period</li>
<li>beginning in Kīhak and ending on the last day of ʾAmshīr of the Coptic months, within the year five-hundred and sixty-six (December&ndash;March 1170&ndash;71 AD),</li>
<li>with the stipulation that they sail downstream from the Island of Michael on the first day of Baramhāt, the Coptic month, within</li>
<li>the aforementioned year, for a rent whose amount for the aforementioned period is fifteen dīnārs, of standard weight, in gold, in minted coin of full weight,</li>
<li>valid Egyptian coins of al-ʿĀḍid, of good alloy. The two elders who were the lessors paid to the one leasing to them, who is named together with them in it (the document), all</li>
<li>the aforementioned rent, namely fifteen dīnārs with the aforementioned properties. And he received that from them, completely and in full, and he released them from</li>
<li>that with a valid release, a release of receipt in full. And he handed over to them the aforementioned gliding boat, on the condition that if they stay on the Island of Michael</li>
<li>for a day or several days of Baramhāt, they would be liable to (the payment of additional) rent in consideration of this. The lessor fixed the cost for them at</li>
<li>three in every ten parts of the cargo going upstream and what was bought with it going downstream. Duty was not liable on it going upstream, but was liable on it</li>
<li>going downstream, in accordance with customary practice. They received the aforementioned gliding boat in accordance with what was stipulated. They contracted that between them with a valid contract</li>
<li>after they discussed it together. Testimony was borne to the acknowledgement by the lessor and the two elders, Guardian of the Dynasty and Glory of the Dynasty, the lessees</li>
<li>named in the document, of everything that is attributed to them in it, while being in sound mind and body, legally capable of conducting their affairs, willingly, not coerced</li>
<li>nor forced. This was in the border town of Aswan on the 20th day of the month of Rabīʿ I of the year five-hundred and sixty-six (12th December 1170 AD). Testimony was borne to this.</li>
</ol>
