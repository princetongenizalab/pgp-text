Recto
1. In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
2. The letter of the Master of the Horses and vizier of the king—may God prolong
3. his life and cause his support, happiness, safety and wellbeing to endure—has arrived and also another letter
4. for the elder Abū al-Ṭāhir ibn Tarīk, in both of which you mention
5. the dispatch of the slave (waṣīf) and his sale. As for the purchase of the goods that
6. you mentioned (in your letter), allocate the expenditure to the elder Abū al-Ṭāhir. I do not intend
7. to return the slave (waṣīf). When your slave boy informed me that you needed
8. the goods, I delivered him (the slave) to the broker and he auctioned him and acquired (the offer of)
9. five dīnārs. I then went to your slave boy and consulted him concerning his sale
10. and sold him for five dīnārs, on the grounds that there is nobody in the land
11. and none of the people have anything. We have dealt with the orders
12. for scented goods. We did not find in the land anything of these that
13. the merchants reckoned to be at market prices. Moreover we did not find the (sufficient) outlay for the goods.
14. So, I sent your slave boy together with my messenger to the market and he bought
15. for a dīnār four balls of sugar, at a price of forty dirhams each,
16. and butter and camphor for twenty-five dirhams, and gum of the mastic tree, laudanum, cardamon,
17. alum, rose liquid, costus, and cinnamon, and myrtle, some small items,
18. spikenard, a dīnār of aromatic oil, salt, juniper, for the price of the slave (waṣīf), which
19. is five dīnārs. If the goods become more expensive, we will not sell them to those taking refuge
20. in the houses with the women due to the inflation. No goods
21. remain in the market. The price of all the spices in the market that I have mentioned
22. has doubled. A record of the goods and their purchase
23. is enclosed in this letter of mine. It has been inserted with a note of all expenditure. What I wish to inform
24. the Ikshīl of is that my slave boy Kablām has arrived at the court of the king, but he (the king) has shown little gratitude
25. for what I have undertaken for him. I am owed by the king two horses. He has sent me two good-for-nothing, aged
26. slave women and six dīnārs. I did not know that Ibn al-ʿAsqalānī
27. is the king from whom my slave boy suffered such abuse. I
