                        <p>1. In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>
<p>2. The letter of the Master of the Horses and vizier of the king&mdash;may God prolong</p>
<p>3. his life and cause his support, happiness, safety and wellbeing to endure&mdash;has arrived and also another letter</p>
<p>4. for the elder Abū al-Ṭāhir ibn Tarīk, in both of which you mention</p>
<p>5. the dispatch of the slave (waṣīf) and his sale. As for the purchase of the goods that</p>
<p>6. you mentioned (in your letter), allocate the expenditure to the elder Abū al-Ṭāhir. I do not intend</p>
<p>7. to return the slave (waṣīf). When your slave boy informed me that you needed</p>
<p>8. the goods, I delivered him (the slave) to the broker and he auctioned him and acquired (the offer of)</p>
<p>9. five dīnārs. I then went to your slave boy and consulted him concerning his sale</p>
<p>10. and sold him for five dīnārs, on the grounds that there is nobody in the land</p>
<p>11. and none of the people have anything. We have dealt with the orders</p>
<p>12. for scented goods. We did not find in the land anything of these that</p>
<p>13. the merchants reckoned to be at market prices. Moreover we did not find the (sufficient) outlay for the goods.</p>
<p>14. So, I sent your slave boy together with my messenger to the market and he bought</p>
<p>15. for a dīnār four balls of sugar, at a price of forty dirhams each,</p>
<p>16. and butter and camphor for twenty-five dirhams, and gum of the mastic tree, laudanum, cardamon,</p>
<p>17. alum, rose liquid, costus, and cinnamon, and myrtle, some small items,</p>
<p>18. spikenard, a dīnār of aromatic oil, salt, juniper, for the price of the slave (waṣīf), which</p>
<p>19. is five dīnārs. If the goods become more expensive, we will not sell them to those taking refuge</p>
<p>20. in the houses with the women due to the inflation. No goods</p>
<p>21. remain in the market. The price of all the spices in the market that I have mentioned</p>
<p>22. has doubled. A record of the goods and their purchase</p>
<p>23. is enclosed in this letter of mine. It has been inserted with a note of all expenditure. What I wish to inform</p>
<p>24. the Ikshīl of is that my slave boy Kablām has arrived at the court of the king, but he (the king) has shown little gratitude</p>
<p>25. for what I have undertaken for him. I am owed by the king two horses. He has sent me two good-for-nothing, aged</p>
<p>26. slave women and six dīnārs. I did not know that Ibn al-ʿAsqalānī</p>
<p>27. is the king from whom my slave boy suffered such abuse. I</p>
