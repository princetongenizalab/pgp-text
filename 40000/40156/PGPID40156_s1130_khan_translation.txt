Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
I have written—may God prolong your life and cause your strength, your wellbeing and your power to endure,
and suppress your enemies—informing him, may God cause his strength to endure, that I have sent
my slave boy, who is called Sharīf, with a brown camel to his honourable presence. I want
you to receive it from me. I have not written you a letter or sent
to your presence anything before today, and I praise God for that. So take
the camel and do not cause him (i.e., Sharīf, my servant) to be delayed by a single day. Send him
to Papa, my servant, who carries out my business, for I shall be cut off from him,
if there is a delay. I send to you warmest greetings and also to those
within your care greetings. Praise be to God alone, His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet,
and his family, and save him. Our sufficiency is in God. What a fine keeper is He!
