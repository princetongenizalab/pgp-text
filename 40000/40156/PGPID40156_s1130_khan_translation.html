<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I have written&mdash;may God prolong your life and cause your strength, your wellbeing and your power to endure,</li>
<li>and suppress your enemies&mdash;informing him, may God cause his strength to endure, that I have sent</li>
<li>my slave boy, who is called Sharīf, with a brown camel to his honourable presence. I want</li>
<li>you to receive it from me. I have not written you a letter or sent</li>
<li>to your presence anything before today, and I praise God for that. So take</li>
<li>the camel and do not cause him (i.e., Sharīf, my servant) to be delayed by a single day. Send him</li>
<li>to Papa, my servant, who carries out my business, for I shall be cut off from him,</li>
<li>if there is a delay. I send to you warmest greetings and also to those</li>
<li>within your care greetings. Praise be to God alone, His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet,</li>
<li>and his family, and save him. Our sufficiency is in God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
