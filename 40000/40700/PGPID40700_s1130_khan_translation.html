<li>[&hellip;] the glorious commander, Ḥiṣn al-Dawla, may God extend his life and cause his support to endure, [and suppress]</li>
<li>his [haters] and his enemies. You know my love for you and my desire to meet you, to see you</li>
<li>and to speak to you, and how ardently I long for the good fortune of your appearance and how impatient I am to see you.</li>
<li>I am one who does not doubt his sincerity nor is uncertain about his brotherliness. I ask God to have the will to grant me the enjoyment</li>
<li>of the continuation of your existence and not to deprive me of your life and to give you lasting protection, and increase your happiness,</li>
<li>not to diminish his family, but to allow his family to live to maturity, and cause him to triumph over his enemies, avenging all those who desert him,</li>
<li>[attempting] to overcome him and with unexpected hostility. May he announce his good news. I thank God</li>
<li>and ask him (God) to grant him the most robust favours so that his good fortune increases for my sake and his gratitude to those after me. I am looking out eagerly</li>
<li>[ ] his happiness.</li>
