Recto

[…] the glorious commander, Ḥiṣn al-Dawla, may God extend his life and cause his support to endure, [and suppress]
his [haters] and his enemies. You know my love for you and my desire to meet you, to see you
and to speak to you, and how ardently I long for the good fortune of your appearance and how impatient I am to see you.
I am one who does not doubt his sincerity nor is uncertain about his brotherliness. I ask God to have the will to grant me the enjoyment
of the continuation of your existence and not to deprive me of your life and to give you lasting protection, and increase your happiness,
not to diminish his family, but to allow his family to live to maturity, and cause him to triumph over his enemies, avenging all those who desert him,
[attempting] to overcome him and with unexpected hostility. May he announce his good news. I thank God
and ask him (God) to grant him the most robust favours so that his good fortune increases for my sake and his gratitude to those after me. I am looking out eagerly
[ ] his happiness.

Recto - right margin

Inform (me) of everything that befalls them as a matter of duty.
[ ] and Abū l-Durr (asks) for his love to be sent in advance. Farewell.

…..
as it is good for a friend and write, forgive me, for I am hoping for news
from the king, may God establish his happiness. All will be well, God willing.
Praise be to God alone and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and his family, and His peace.
