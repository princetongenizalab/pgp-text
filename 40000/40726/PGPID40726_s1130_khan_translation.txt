Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
These lines are arriving, my dear brother—may God prolong your life and cause your strength, support,
happiness and wellbeing to endure—by the hand of Mariane the Nubian. A man known as Qērqe had come with a woman and divorced her in my presence
a long time ago. The man bringing (to you) these lines came to me and I wrote for him a marriage contract
for this woman a year ago. Recently he (the former husband) came and acted wrongfully towards the wife
of this man and took her out of his house, claiming that she was his wife. When you, my brother, read these
lines, seize this man and do what is required by law with regard to him.
After he has been detained, send him to me together with the wife and her husband, the bearer of these lines,
since I wrote her divorce document and I wrote her marriage document. Reply to this letter of mine, so that I can act with them according to the requirements of the law.
Tell us about your news, your circumstances and your needs, so I can bring about what pleases you with regard to them, God willing.
I send you the very best wishes for God’s peace. God is our sufficiency. What a fine keeper is He!
May God bless Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and may He save (them).

By the way, I met you the day before yesterday by
the door of the compound of my lord the commander,
may God cause his exaltation to endure, and I said to you “If you need
anything, I shall do it.” I wish you long life.
