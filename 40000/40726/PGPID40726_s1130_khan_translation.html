<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>These lines are arriving, my dear brother&mdash;may God prolong your life and cause your strength, support,</li>
<li>happiness and wellbeing to endure&mdash;by the hand of Mariane the Nubian. A man known as Qērqe had come with a woman and divorced her in my presence</li>
<li>a long time ago. The man bringing (to you) these lines came to me and I wrote for him a marriage contract</li>
<li>for this woman a year ago. Recently he (the former husband) came and acted wrongfully towards the wife</li>
<li>of this man and took her out of his house, claiming that she was his wife. When you, my brother, read these</li>
<li>lines, seize this man and do what is required by law with regard to him.</li>
<li>After he has been detained, send him to me together with the wife and her husband, the bearer of these lines,</li>
<li>since I wrote her divorce document and I wrote her marriage document. Reply to this letter of mine, so that I can act with them according to the requirements of the law.</li>
<li>Tell us about your news, your circumstances and your needs, so I can bring about what pleases you with regard to them, God willing.</li>
<li>I send you the very best wishes for God&rsquo;s peace. God is our sufficiency. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
<li>May God bless Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and may He save (them).</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>By the way, I met you the day before yesterday by</li>
<li>the door of the compound of my lord the commander,</li>
<li>may God cause his exaltation to endure, and I said to you &ldquo;If you need</li>
<li>anything, I shall do it.&rdquo; I wish you long life.</li>

                        <ol>
<li>By God, do not delay sending me this man, the wife and her husband after you detain him</li>
<li>and do to him what is required by law, because he actedwrongfully to the wife of this man.</li>
<li>Ensure that their correct legal situation is known and authorise that, God willing. I would be most grateful to you.</li>
<li>He (the bearer of this letter) went to the judge in Akhmīm, may God cause his strength to endure, and he sent him to me, since I wrote her marriage contract.</li>
<li>I have informed you of this, so that you will know it, God willing.</li>

<li>To my dear brother Abū l-Ḥasan Zuhayr,</li>
<li>may God prolong his life and cause his strength and his wellbeing to endure.</li>
<li>From the one who loves him, the judge Hibat Allāh b. Makīn,</li>
<li>in al-Marāgha.</li>
