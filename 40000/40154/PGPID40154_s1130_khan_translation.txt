Recto

In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.
I inform the Ikshīl and Master of the Horses—may God prolong his life
and cause his protection, safety and wellbeing to endure— that he knows that
every year a large number of boats travel to your land
and your colleagues badly mistreat them. This year
the people from the port (of Aswan) were hindered
in two ways. One of these is the injustice done to them by the people of the land
and the other is the lack of produce. So, I took1 some haircutters (and opened sacks of produce)
and gave relief to the people and the first of them
were the people in your land. If it was not for me, they (i.e., our people) would not have found produce,
nor did anybody dare send (produce). I have sent

two boats and everything in them is mine. I would like
the Ikshīl to ensure that nobody obstructs
them and that nobody diminishes
what is rightly theirs, and if they need
pieces of calico cloth, then please undertake to provide these
for them.

They will not receive a favour from you without being grateful, if God wills.
If you have any need, write to me concerning it, if God, the Mighty and Glorious, wills.
Praise be to God alone, His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and His peace.
Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!
