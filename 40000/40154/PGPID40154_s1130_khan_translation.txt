and cause his protection, safety and wellbeing to endure— that he knows that

and your colleagues badly mistreat them. This year
the people from the port (of Aswan) were hindered
in two ways. One of these is the injustice done to them by the people of the land
and the other is the lack of produce. So, I took1 some haircutters (and opened sacks of produce)
and gave relief to the people and the first of them
were the people in your land. If it was not for me, they (i.e., our people) would not have found produce,
nor did anybody dare send (produce). I have sent

Recto, right margin
1. two boats and everything in them is mine. I would like
2. the Ikšīl to ensure that nobody obstructs
3. them and that nobody diminishes
4. what is rightly theirs, and if they need
5. pieces of calico cloth, then please undertake to provide these
6. for them.
