<li>In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the Ikshīl and Master of the Horses&mdash;may God prolong his life</li>
<li>and cause his protection, safety and wellbeing to endure&mdash; that he knows that</li>
<li>every year a large number of boats travel to your land</li>
<li>and your colleagues badly mistreat them. This year</li>
<li>the people from the port (of Aswan) were hindered</li>
<li>in two ways. One of these is the injustice done to them by the people of the land</li>
<li>and the other is the lack of produce. So, I took1 some haircutters (and opened sacks of produce)</li>
<li>and gave relief to the people and the first of them</li>
<li>were the people in your land. If it was not for me, they (i.e., our people) would not have found produce,</li>
<li>nor did anybody dare send (produce). I have sent</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>two boats and everything in them is mine. I would like</li>
<li>the Ikshīl to ensure that nobody obstructs</li>
<li>them and that nobody diminishes</li>
<li>what is rightly theirs, and if they need</li>
<li>pieces of calico cloth, then please undertake to provide these</li>
<li>for them.</li>

<li>They will not receive a favour from you without being grateful, if God wills.</li>
<li>If you have any need, write to me concerning it, if God, the Mighty and Glorious, wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
