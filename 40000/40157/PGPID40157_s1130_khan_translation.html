<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>May God prolong the life of the Ik&scaron;īl, the Master of the Horses, the vizier of the king,</li>
<li>and cause his support, happiness, safety and wellbeing to endure. The bearer of this letter, who has travelled (to you),</li>
<li>is the leader Ḥasan, the son of the leader Shujāʿ al-Dawla (&lsquo;the Courage of the State&rsquo;) ʾIsḥāq, the administrator of the gate.</li>
<li>His status with me is firmly established and his rank is well-known,</li>
<li>may God decree his safety and cause him to have good company. The one who [ &hellip;..]</li>
<li>to you, has a good reputation and is well spoken of, and these are qualities that</li>
<li>are abundantly exhibited by those who come to him (i.e., you, the Ikshīl) and are sent to him. The Ikshīl does not</li>
<li>need my recommendation with regard to him or my reassurances to show him respect</li>
<li>and treat him well, and grant him the status of those of my personal slaves that are similar to him</li>
<li>with regard to care, guardianship, supervision and protection</li>
<li>until the time of waiting for the one who is grateful to the Ikshīl. Whatever</li>
<li>kindness and good he (the Ik&scaron;īl) does in his (the bearer of the letter&rsquo;s) regard, I shall appreciate and be thankful for.</li>
<li>So, may the Ikshīl (send) a letter and do not omit to ask me in it to carry out his needs and to let me know in it</li>
<li>15. the latest news, if God, the Mighty and Glorious, wills it.</li>
<li>16. Praise be to God alone and His blessings on our lord, Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
