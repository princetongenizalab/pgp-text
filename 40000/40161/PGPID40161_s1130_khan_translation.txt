Recto


In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.


I inform the Ikshīl, Master of the Horses and vizier of the king—


may God prolong his life and cause his happiness, safety and wellbeing to endure—that


my letter has been presented to him (i.e., you) through the agency of my master, Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla). I inform him (i.e., you) that my slaves


are travelling to the king, may God cause him to live. I have informed him (i.e., you)


that I have had a letter written by them to the king, indicating I shall carry out


the wish of the king in his land. Please ask him to commit


to protecting my slaves, to making provision for them and to caring for them,


and to ensure that nobody has had the audacity to be hostile to them. These people


have friendly relations with the land of the king and request


only justice and kindness. My slaves


Recto, right margin


Kaylā and ʿĀli have travelled with my fabrics. If somebody


cares for the slave boy and does good to him,


he does it to his master. This is


my instruction to you. May God decree their protection,


and the king receive them with kindness and honour.


Verso


Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and his family, and His peace.


Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!
