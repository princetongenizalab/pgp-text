                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>
<p>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I inform the Ikshīl, Master of the Horses and vizier of the king—</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God prolong his life and cause his happiness, safety and wellbeing to endure—that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my letter has been presented to him (i.e., you) through the agency of my master, Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla). I inform him (i.e., you) that my slaves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are travelling to the king, may God cause him to live. I have informed him (i.e., you)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that I have had a letter written by them to the king, indicating I shall carry out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wish of the king in his land. Please ask him to commit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to protecting my slaves, to making provision for them and to caring for them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and to ensure that nobody has had the audacity to be hostile to them. These people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have friendly relations with the land of the king and request</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only justice and kindness. My slaves</p>
</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Kaylā and ʿĀli have travelled with my fabrics. If somebody</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cares for the slave boy and does good to him,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he does it to his master. This is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my instruction to you. May God decree their protection,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the king receive them with kindness and honour.</p>
</li>

<p>Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and his family, and His peace.</p>

<p>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</p>

<p>To the Ikshīl, Master of the Horses, vizier of the king,</p>
</li>

<p>Uruwī ibn Khiyākh, the deputy of the king in the citadel of Ibrīm,</p>
