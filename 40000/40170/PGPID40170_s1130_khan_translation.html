<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The letter of your honour, my lord, the Master of the Horses&mdash;may God prolong his life and cause</li>
<li>his support, exaltation, supremacy, resplendence andpower to endure and suppress in abject humility</li>
<li>all his enviers and enemies&mdash;has arrived. As for what you have said with regard to the service of the king, we are all</li>
<li>his servants and slaves of the crown (i.e., his subjects). As for your saying that the ships conveying</li>
<li>the horses have stopped, I was intending to (send them) until the order of the ruler, may God make his reign eternal, reached me</li>
<li>by the hand of his brother, the governor of our land, together with a letter to the king informing him (the king) that if he (the king) needed</li>
<li>an army, he (the ruler) would send it to him, but he (the ruler) has prohibited me from sending to you</li>
<li>the first instalment of the horses until these messengers (i.e., my slave boy and the slave boy of the ruler) arrive (at the king). For the slave boy of the ruler has set off together</li>
<li>with my slave boy to the king. Please, please allow them passage, after showing them due honour and respect,</li>
<li>to the king, and request him in your letter not to delaythem for a single hour,</li>
<li>for the army will indeed wait for only the arrival of themessengers who have travelled to you.</li>
<li>Jajrī will speak with you, together with Kabān, concerning what they have seen. Kabān has visited</li>
<li>the governor of Qūṣ and heard what he said. He (Kabān) will meet you and tell you in person what he witnessed.</li>
<li>The full instruction (for you) is that you emphasise to the king that he should not make</li>
<li>the servants stay. You know that I say all this only</li>
<li>in the interest of the king. I am his slave and servant. Ihave sent you a mare of excellent quality</li>
<li>from my horses for your personal benefit by the hand of my slave boy Yaḥyā. Be so kind as to accept it. Whatever need you have,</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>you would please me by allowing me to carry it out. Praise be to God alone and blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, the prophet, and his family, and may He save (them). My sufficiency is God. What an excellent keeper is He!</li>
