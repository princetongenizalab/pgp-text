<li>Any achievement of mine is due to God&rsquo;s help alone.</li>
<li>People say that in journeys there is ignominy, difficulty, humiliation and homesickness.</li>
<li>Not me, for on my journey pleasures and good living were made possible for me.</li>
<li>I won the friendship of a brother, a leader of distinction and generous character,</li>
<li>One raised by esteemed and noble leaders of men, whose status towered above the peaks of excellence.</li>
<li>His magnanimity led him to treat me as a brother; distance from home made us kin.</li>
<li>He invited me to travel to a land of safety and comfort.</li>
<li>I mounted a superb steed which bore us along as a cloud scuds along.</li>
<li>Its sails were spread in splendour as it moved, like an eagle spreads its wings.</li>
<li>On board were a company of good men, all brimming over with generosity.</li>
<li>Their natures were created for every kind of liberality, their deeds by which difficulties were made insignificant,</li>
<li>ʿUbayd and ʿĀbid al-Raḥmān, neither of them secluded from excellence.</li>
<li>The benefits of their kindness overwhelmed me; even old friends could not have given as much.</li>
<li>If I could, I would have made my cheek the dust of the ground they trod.</li>
<li>The ship&rsquo;s captain was astute and skilled; his wise decisions guided good judgment itself.</li>
<li>We admired his conduct, and imagined him a descendant of Noah.</li>
<li>His men were tough and strong; when summoned (to help) with a problem, they instantly obeyed,</li>
</ol>

<li>Jumping to work like lions, gaping (to consume) their prey.</li>
<li>Muḥammad among them was a sun that continued to shine. Sayyid was for the wearied traveller an ever-present star.</li>
<li>Badr was their full moon, ʾAbū Ḥabīb their sky and Maḥbūb a bright meteor.</li>
<li>The mild Bū al-ʿĪd was their heaven and the ornament of Ismāʿīl was youth.</li>
