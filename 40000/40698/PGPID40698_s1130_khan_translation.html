<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform al-Bazīl, the deputy of the Master of the Horses in the fortress of Ibrīm&mdash;</li>
<li>may God cause his protection, safety and wellbeing to endure&mdash;that</li>
<li>the bearer of these lines is the Head, may God decree his safety,</li>
<li>and he must be shown favour and respect, and be protected from breach of trust and from unjust treatment by merchants and competitors,</li>
<li>and the means of harm should be removed from them until they willingly desist from causing such harm, if God wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, the prophet, and his pure family.</li>
