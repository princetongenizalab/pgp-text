In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
I inform al-Bazīl, the deputy of the Master of the Horses in the fortress of Ibrīm—
may God cause his protection, safety and wellbeing to endure—that
the bearer of these lines is the Head, may God decree his safety,
and he must be shown favour and respect, and be protected from breach of trust and from unjust treatment by merchants and competitors,
and the means of harm should be removed from them until they willingly desist from causing such harm, if God wills.
Praise be to God alone and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, the prophet, and his pure family.
