Whoever wants to know the date of the tequfah should calculate
the number of years from the creation of the world until now. Take the number of days by which
solar years exceed lunar years and add them up, and turn them into years, and what
does not make up a year turn into months, and what does not make up a month
retain as days, and this is when the tequfah will fall. For 100 years, take for the sun 25
days, 4 hours, 492 parts. For 1000 years, take 251 days, 20 hours,
300 + 300 i.e. 600 parts. For 4000 years there are 1007 days, 10
hours, 240 parts. And for 600 (years) there are 151 days, 2 hours,
792 parts. Their total is 1158 days, 12 hours, 1032 parts.
The total for 4603 years is [ ….]
1191 days, 4 hours, 564 parts.
