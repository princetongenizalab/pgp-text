<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>I inform the Master of the Horses [and vizier of the king]&mdash;may God prolong his life, cause his support, his guardianship,</li>
<li>his safety and his high office to endure&mdash;of my arrival at the border of Aswan, may God protect it, [ ] and I trust that</li>
<li>the conveyor of this letter of mine from me, Hibat Allāh ibn Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Qulzumī, has arrived. I</li>
<li>[request that you arrange for] the dispatch of a messenger to it (Aswan?) afterwards. Please ensure that he proceeds safely to his colleagues, and take care of</li>
<li>this colleague of mine and protect him, and also his colleagues in the armed garrison post, in order that his lettermay reach me, thankfully, here (Aswan). I thank</li>
<li>him for that and shall requite him. I request that he writes&mdash;for which I would be most grateful&mdash;concerning his news and his situation. I would be glad</li>
<li>of that and delighted, if God wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon Muḥammad, those who succeeded him and companions, and may He save (them), and His peace.</li>
<li>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!</li>
