Recto

In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.
I inform the Master of the Horses [and vizier of the king]—may God prolong his life, cause his support, his guardianship,
his safety and his high office to endure—of my arrival at the border of Aswan, may God protect it, [ ] and I trust that
the conveyor of this letter of mine from me, Hibat Allāh ibn Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Qulzumī, has arrived. I
[request that you arrange for] the dispatch of a messenger to it (Aswan?) afterwards. Please ensure that he proceeds safely to his colleagues, and take care of
this colleague of mine and protect him, and also his colleagues in the armed garrison post, in order that his lettermay reach me, thankfully, here (Aswan). I thank
him for that and shall requite him. I request that he writes—for which I would be most grateful—concerning his news and his situation. I would be glad
of that and delighted, if God wills.
Praise be to God alone, and His blessings be upon Muḥammad, those who succeeded him and companions, and may He save (them), and His peace.
Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is He!
