I, Masliaḥ b. Nissim, wrote this
in my own hand and proofread and compared it with an accurate copy
on Wednesday, 2nd of the month
of Tammuz—may the Omnipresent blessed be He change it into a time of joy
and happiness—in the year one thousand, four five
hundred and four, Era of the Documents, which we use customarily
for dating, in the city of Cairo, located
on the Nile. Peace.
