Recto



In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.


May God prolong the life of the Master of the Horses, the vizier of the king


and his Ikshīl, may God preserve his life and cause his happiness, his safety,


his wellbeing and protection to endure. My companion, the leader Saʿāda, has set off. I have sent him to carry out


various tasks that I have commissioned him to do. The Ikshīl is requested to send to specify


the identity of the matters that need to be dealt with and send a request regarding them


so that I am made grateful to the Ikshīl (for having the opportunity of carrying them out). There is no greater generosity


performed by the Ikshīl than what the Ikshīl will have done with regard to the duty of


showing respect, kindness and polite hospitality for the leader Saʿāda.


Recto, right margin



Is the Ikshīl not in need


of something?


Let him give instruction for it to be carried out and I would be grateful (for the opportunity to do the service),


if God, the mighty and magnificent, wills.


Praise be to God alone. His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and His peace.
