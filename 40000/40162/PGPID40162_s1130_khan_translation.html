<p>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>

<li>
<p>May God prolong the life of the Master of the Horses, the vizier of the king</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and his Ikshīl, may God preserve his life and cause his happiness, his safety,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his wellbeing and protection to endure. My companion, the leader Saʿāda, has set off. I have sent him to carry out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>various tasks that I have commissioned him to do. The Ikshīl is requested to send to specify</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the identity of the matters that need to be dealt with and send a request regarding them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so that I am made grateful to the Ikshīl (for having the opportunity of carrying them out). There is no greater generosity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performed by the Ikshīl than what the Ikshīl will have done with regard to the duty of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>showing respect, kindness and polite hospitality for the leader Saʿāda.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Is the Ikshīl not in need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of something?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let him give instruction for it to be carried out and I would be grateful (for the opportunity to do the service),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if God, the mighty and magnificent, wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone. His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and His peace.</p>
