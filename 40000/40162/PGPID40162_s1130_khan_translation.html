                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letter of my master the Ikshīl, Master of the Horses— may God prolong his life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and cause his wellbeing to endure, and suppress his enemies—has arrived and I have read it, happy at its arrival</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and delighted at its delivery. As for what he has (i.e., you have) mentioned about the situation of the journey to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the king and his (i.e., your) saying that he is (i.e you are) afraid, well, praise be to God the Exalted, I am not a soldier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the king’s army that I should be feared. I am a man who is a merchant, the slave of one who had done good to me. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, I am not one who refuses to have an audience with the king, may God preserve him. I travelled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>previously to him and he showed me favour, facilitated my affairs, did good to me and promised me a consignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am his slave and his servant. He has an excellent reputation. As for their saying that I am the slave boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the Master of the Spear—I am only a merchant. I was the guest of the king and I lodged with the Master of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Spear like the (other) merchants. Not everybody who lodges with a person is his slave boy. He treats guests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well. When somebody treats the merchants well, they rush (to stay) with him. You, Ikshīl,</p>
</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>when you treat people and merchants well, they rush to (stay with) you, and you are (greatly) thanked in the land of the Muslims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have desisted from journeying to the king only in consideration of the fact that Ramaḍān is a difficult month and I am anxious about travelling</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>on the road before breaking the fast. If God wills, I shall travel to the king after the festival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ask for her (i.e., your) kindness to write a letter to the slave of the king requesting him to deliver to me the consignment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that he promised me. Please could this be done through your agency. I could not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>send you a reply to your letter without cash payment. I only had a single slave (waṣīf)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who supplied water for me. I sent him to you together with five pieces (of fabric), a large basket drinking vessel, a small basket of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sweets and a mattress for you. These were things for you and for you alone. But you never let me know (whether you received them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could not send you a reply to a letter you sent without cash payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want you to send me my slave boy quickly. By God’s truth, if it were not for my journey to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the king, I would not have sent you this little (gift). Do not make the slave boy delay a single day,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but send him to me with your slave boy, so that I can go (to the king) together with him, if God wills. Greetings to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and good wishes, if God wills. Give the king my greetings and inform him that, if God wills, I shall be coming to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone. But I cannot travel until</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my slave boy arrives, so send him quickly, quickly!</p>
</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Send your letter to me, so that a group of merchants can enter (to see the king) with me, for you would thereby help</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>them in their livelihood. So, I would like your letter for them to reach me.</p>
</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso, address, right column</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>May this letter reach my lord, the Ikshīl,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master of the Horses, Uruwī, may God prolong his life. </p>
</li>
