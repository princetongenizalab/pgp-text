<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>(This is) my letter to you, my father, who is dear to me&mdash;may God prolong your life and cause your strength, your support, your happiness,</li>
<li>your safety and your wellbeing to endure&mdash;and (I have written this) while missing you greatly, may God bring ustogether in the happiest circumstances in his kindness and grace.</li>
<li>He has the power over that and is able to do it, God willing. What I wish to inform you of, my father, is that wehave arrived in Soba</li>
<li>safe and sound. I lack nothing by the gracious kindness of God except the opportunity to see your gracious face.</li>
<li>I wish we did not lack it or were not bereft of it. All we have in our power is something missing that is longed for. Please make an effort to</li>
<li>send us your news with whomsoever may happen to travel to the land of Nubia. We would be happy about thatand be able</li>
<li>to be informed about what he knows about your situation. We are only meeting one another by chance. If the king had</li>
<li>come to us in Soba, we would not have stayed in the country more than a month or two months, but they/he&mdash;(We are) with</li>
<li>the merchandise that we have for the king and his army, but we have found that there is only little (business) in the land.</li>
<li>We are in good health. We arrived in Soba in the last ten days of the month of Ramaḍān in the year</li>
<li>four-hundred and eighty-five (25th October&ndash;3rd November 1092 AD). I am writing this letter on the tenth day of Shawwāl (13th November 1092 AD). I send you</li>
<li>warmest greetings. Greetings to my mother. Greetings to my children and my family. Greetings to my brother ʾAbū al-Durr.</li>
<li>Greetings to my grandmother and maternal uncle. Greetings to ʾAbū al -Qāsim and Muḥammad. Greetings to ʾAbū al-Ḥasan</li>
<li>and Ṣabīra. Greetings to Yaḥyā and Qāʾid. Greetings to the elder ʿAlī.</li>
