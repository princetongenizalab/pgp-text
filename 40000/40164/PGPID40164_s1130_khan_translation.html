<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The letters of my honourable lord the Ikshīl, vizier of theking&mdash;may God establish</li>
<li>his happiness and protect his status forever and suppressthose who hate him</li>
<li>and his enemies&mdash;have reached me and I have read themand taken note of their contents. I thank</li>
<li>God, the Exalted, for his safety and health, and I requestHim to increase these</li>
<li>for him and grant him eternal wellbeing. As for the statement of the Ikshīl, may</li>
<li>God cause his support to endure, that I have shown neglect for his status and have not inquired</li>
<li>about him, the situation is not like that. I recognise his eminence, and am steadfast</li>
<li>in my love for him and my gratitude to him in all circumstances. As for the situation of the trade consignment,</li>
<li>since your honour requested it, when I reached the land, Iasked about</li>
<li>it, but did not find any of it. I did not want to1 neglect thisand so I</li>
<li>sent somebody to Qūṣ to buy it. I promise when he has reached me</li>
<li>safely I shall send it to him (i.e., you) with anybody whoarrives. I swear by God</li>
<li>that no perfumes have arrived from al-Makārim that I could send to him (i.e., you), rather</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I am waiting for the arrival of</li>
<li>al-Makārim so that I can send (to you) what he has man-aged to find and trade.</li>
<li>Your honour has asked about his news and I</li>
<li>am making inquiries for you. If he manages to find suchmerchandise,</li>
<li>I shall send it to him (i.e., you) to his (i.e., your)</li>
<li>satisfaction. The reason I have delayed sending my letters</li>
<li>to him (i.e., you) is only that I travelled to say farewell</li>
<li>to the commander Treasure of the Dynasty (Kanz al-Dawla), may</li>
<li>God establish his good omen and his glory,</li>
<li>so that he may carry out all his tasks</li>
<li>successfully.</li>

<li>I request the Ikshīl kindly to send me his letters containing</li>
<li>what tasks or services he may have (for me to carry out). Ihave sent with the conveyor</li>
<li>of these words (i.e., this letter) a payment, which consistsof a raṭl of vinegar and an ounce of spikenard</li>
<li>for the housekeeper. I had already sent him (i.e., you) anadvance</li>
<li>of two ounces of nascaphthon roots with one of his (i.e., your) messengers who indeed knew her (the housekeeper). I send</li>
<li>the honourable Master of the Horses warmest greetings,the purest love and respect,</li>
<li>wishes for future good, if God wills.</li>
