<li>
<p>I inform the exalted and glorious presence, the Ikshīl and Master of the Horses—may God prolong his life and cause</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his well-being, success, protection and safety to endure, and cause his power to endure in happiness—that my son-in-law, who is called Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad</p>

<li>
<p>ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, the merchant, has set off (to you). He has suffered the loss of a debt owed to him by some spendthrift people known as the sons of Kajja, namely Makārim, Muḥibb and Faraj.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Makārim stood guarantor for his brother Muḥibb with regard to his part of the debt that was owed to him (my son-in-law) by them with the testimony of a group of travellers</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>whatever you do would be a kindness. He is waiting for you to get back to me, and will be most grateful, if God wills.</p>

<li>
<p>Whatever need you have, write to me concerning it and I shall be happy to carry it out.</p>

<li>
<p>Whatever charity you could consider, be it much or little,</p>

<p>oh God, God, God, God, for this son-in-law of mine [please do], for you have an obligation to him, for my money is with your majesty, may</p>
