<li>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</li>
<li>The reason for sending this message, may God prolong his life, my honourable lord,</li>
<li>the Ikshīl, Master of the Horses, vizier of the king, may God cause his support, his exaltedness, his ascendance,</li>
<li>his splendour, his loftiness and his elevation to endure,and crush in humility his enviers and his enemies, his slaves</li>
<li>[kiss the ground] before him and report to him that it has not been concealed from him that his slaves</li>
<li>were dependent on the administrative director in his presence without being in financial partnership. They informhim that</li>
<li>the slave whom he bestowed upon his slaves (i.e., the writers of this letter) through the agency of Bazilī was</li>
<li>sick, and that his slaves (i.e., the writers) wanted to return her, but the messenger whom</li>
<li>she accompanied became ill, and that the slave girl and her son, Rāhim, your slave boy, were examined before purchase three</li>
<li>times, and that she and her son have died. As for his slaves (i.e., the writers of this letter), he is best informed about their circumstances,</li>
<li>and that they only demand from him according to what isreported about him with regard to high praise,</li>
<li>kind words and pious prayer, so put us in a position to begrateful to him, as other people are,</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>thankful to be gathered</li>
<li>into his (favour) to praise him. People only seek to obtain something</li>
<li>through asking your favour. But we have lost this.</li>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>If it was not for the news we have heard from the north and the strife of the land, your</li>
<li>slaves (i.e., the writers) would have made sure to present ourselves before you to kiss the ground and to perform their</li>
<li>obligations. But you know that you do not have any slaves (al-riqq) to send to the northern land to receive</li>
<li>news. So, we have sent the bearer of this message, Bazilī. But do with him what is appropriate for your manner (of conducting affairs)</li>
<li>and what you are in a position to do, for your carrier has absconded (lit. "has left on feet of cotton"). Please arrange for</li>
<li>your command to be issued to some of your slaves to etract forcibly from him what is appropriate,</li>
<li>God willing. Your slaves expect your kindness and munificence, as they have unceasingly enjoyed</li>
<li>your kindness, if God, the Mighty and Glorious, wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone and His blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, His prophet, and his family, and may He save (them).</li>
</ol>

<li>Your carrier has arrived, grateful for your kindness and the good</li>
<li>that you have done. We also are grateful to you for this and would like to help you with regard to it, if God wills.</li>
