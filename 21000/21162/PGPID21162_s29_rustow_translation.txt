Recto

[In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.] Thanks be to God forever.
[Testimony of the shaykh                           of the] realm and its support Abū Muḥammad Tharwa b. Sālim and the shaykh Abū
[                  ]... of the Dīwān al-Abwāb and what it administers, Ḥasūn b. Ashʿāth, captain
[          ] the shaykh Abū l-Baqāʾ and his partners in which there was produce labeled for two iqṭāʿ-holders together.
This captain was addressed on the subject of what was contained in his ship, which he had steered to the Guarded (Dār) Ṣināʿa (the customs-port of Fustat). He replied
that there was nothing else beside the produce that was on his ship, and he swore by God, may his mention be exalted, and by our lord
and master the imām al-Mustanṣir bi-llāh, commander of the faithful, prayers to God be upon him and upon his pure ancestors
and most noble progeny, and on his protégé the most exalted lord, commander of the armies, sword of Islam, victorious one of the imām, protector
of the qāḍīs of the Muslims, leader of the dāʿīs of the believers, may He strengthen the religion through him and benefit (it) during the life of 
the commander of the faithful, may his power endure and his word be exalted. So they conducted a thorough audit of this ship, and found on it 
something other than the aforementioned produce. 
Therefore he gave his attestation, in sound body and legally capable of conducting his affairs, during the first ten days
of Rabīʿ I 486.
Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-? the ? signed his attestation.
