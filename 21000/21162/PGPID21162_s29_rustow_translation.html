<li>and master the imām al-Mustanṣir bi-llāh, commander of the faithful, prayers to God be upon him and upon his pure ancestors</li>
<li>and most noble progeny, and on his prot&eacute;g&eacute; the most exalted lord, commander of the armies, sword of Islam, victorious one of the imām, protector</li>

<li>of Rabīʿ I 486.</li>
<li>Aḥmad b. ʿAbd al-? the ? signed his attestation.</li>
