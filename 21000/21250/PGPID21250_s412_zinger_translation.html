<li>
<p>(1-2) Sitt al-Kull bt. Elijah, wife of [... Yakhīn] b. Shabbat called Mr. [....] m(ay he rest in) E(den), presented to us, the court, the deed of Ketubba owed by her aforementioned husband, Yakh[in] b. Shabbtay. We read, examined, verified</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and confirmed with complete certainty that she is owed according to it (i.e. according to the ketubba) by her husband, the aforementioned Mr. Yakhīn,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seventy-fi[ve] dinars, from which twenty- five are actual dinars6 and fifty dinars are a dowry, according to the custom of the land,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for which she is owed by him a third, that is 16 2&frasl;3 dinars. According to this ketubba, she is&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trustworthy in respect to him as long as he live and in respect to all his heirs after him as two trustworthy valid witness. After the aforementioned&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ketubba was confirmed by us with complete certainty,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the aforementioned Si[tt al-]Kull said to us: &ldquo;Know, O court, that my husband has tarried7 in Fustat (Miṣr) and abandoned me more or less s[ix or read: seven]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>years ago. He travelled without depositing maintenance with me, nor what I&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or his daughter may be sustained with. I am still waiting patiently; [perhaps] he will return or send me and his daughter [what]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we may be sustained with. Now, the matter has become very difficult for me and I have nothing left to be succored with. I do not know&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what to do. Therefore, I ask to appoint Ibrahīm b. Abū al-Khayr as my proxy to go to my husband, the aforementioned Thābit&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b. Shabbat to sue him for the maintenance I am owed by him, from the time he left until today.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If he chooses [ ] to me [ ] in all that is due to me from my aforementioned ketubba,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delayed marriage gift and dowry [....] and will give it to him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[... ] and bear witness for me [</p>
