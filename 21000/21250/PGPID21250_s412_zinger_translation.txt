Recto


(1-2) Sitt al-Kull bt. Elijah, wife of [... Yakhīn] b. Shabbat called Mr. [....] m(ay he rest in) E(den), presented to us, the court, the deed of Ketubba owed by her aforementioned husband, Yakh[in] b. Shabbtay. We read, examined, verified

 

 and confirmed with complete certainty that she is owed according to it (i.e. according to the ketubba) by her husband, the aforementioned Mr. Yakhīn, 


seventy-fi[ve] dinars, from which twenty- five are actual dinars6 and fifty dinars are a dowry, according to the custom of the land,


for which she is owed by him a third, that is 16 2⁄3 dinars. According to this ketubba, she is 


trustworthy in respect to him as long as he live and in respect to all his heirs after him as two trustworthy valid witness. After the aforementioned 


Ketubba was confirmed by us with complete certainty, 


the aforementioned Si[tt al-]Kull said to us: “Know, O court, that my husband has tarried7 in Fustat (Miṣr) and abandoned me more or less s[ix or read: seven] 


years ago. He travelled without depositing maintenance with me, nor what I 


or his daughter may be sustained with. I am still waiting patiently; [perhaps] he will return or send me and his daughter [what] 


we may be sustained with. Now, the matter has become very difficult for me and I have nothing left to be succored with. I do not know 


what to do. Therefore, I ask to appoint Ibrahīm b. Abū al-Khayr as my proxy to go to my husband, the aforementioned Thābit 


b. Shabbat to sue him for the maintenance I am owed by him, from the time he left until today. 


If he chooses [ ] to me [ ] in all that is due to me from my aforementioned ketubba, 


delayed marriage gift and dowry [....] and will give it to him 


[... ] and bear witness for me [
