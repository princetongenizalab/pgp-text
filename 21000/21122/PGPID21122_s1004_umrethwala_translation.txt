Recto

The slave kisses the ground and reports that he [the addressee] showed kindness to him by appointing him in [
[                       ]in the state bureau 
By releasing [         ]in his lofty and prophetic hand, and the hand of those whose
supervision preceded him, and registering it in the state bureau ….and he asks for the issuance of the noble decree
may God increase its glory by notifying what befell(?) the bureau in that regard
He asks that benefaction be extended to him by adjudicating him according to the testimonies established for him, by showing benefaction on him, and kindness to him
and for the lofty opinions
