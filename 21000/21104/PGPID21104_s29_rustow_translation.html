<li>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.</li>
<li>Bū Saʿd b. Hibatallāh the Jewish trad[er] acknowledged [and testified, in sound health and free will]</li>
<li>without compulsion, without d[uress, without force, without negligence, without error, without any of the factors that invalidate testimony, that he]</li>
<li>has submitted to him, on the date of the year 529 [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ]</li>
<li>3&frac12; dīnārs that were in commenda (qiraḍ) of his and with him between [him and Fulān b. Fulān]</li>
<li>the aforementioned amount to the jahbadh of the dīwān .....[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;] from the Upper Ṣaʿīd [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]</li>
<li>fulfill the sharecropping as normally carried out. When he fails to present the aforementioned receipt in the name of the aforementioned ḍāmin,</li>
<li>he must make good on the aforementioned amount from his own money that he alone possesses, whenever (the ḍāmin) prefers and chooses, without resistance, without</li>
<li>opposition, without argument and without pretext. He acknowledged and testified willingly on the day ... the month of Rajab</li>
<li>of the year 529, two months (?)</li>
<li>It is valid.&nbsp;</li>
