<li>has submitted to him, on the date of the year 529 [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ]</li>

<li>he must make good on the aforementioned amount from his own money that he alone possesses, whenever (the ḍāmin) prefers and chooses, without resistance, without</li>
<li>opposition, without argument and without pretext. He acknowledged and testified willingly on the day ... the month of Rajab</li>
<li>of the year 529, two months (?)</li>
