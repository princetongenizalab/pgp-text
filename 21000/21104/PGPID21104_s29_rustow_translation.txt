Recto

In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.
Bū Saʿd b. Hibatallāh the Jewish trad[er] acknowledged [and testified, in sound health and free will]
without compulsion, without d[uress, without force, without negligence, without error, without any of the factors that invalidate testimony, that he]
has submitted to him, on the date of the year 529 [                          ]
3½ dīnārs that were in commenda (qiraḍ) of his and with him between [him and Fulān b. Fulān]
the aforementioned amount to the jahbadh of the dīwān .....[     ] from the Upper Ṣaʿīd [                 ]
fulfill the sharecropping as normally carried out. When he fails to present the aforementioned receipt in the name of the aforementioned ḍāmin,
he must make good on the aforementioned amount from his own money that he alone possesses, whenever (the ḍāmin) prefers and chooses, without resistance, without
opposition, without argument and without pretext. He acknowledged and testified willingly on the day ... the month of Rajab
of the year 529, two months (?)
It is valid.
