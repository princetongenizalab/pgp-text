                        <p>His slave Muslim b. ʿAbd al-Jabbār.</p>
<p>2. In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. Registered.</p>
<p>3. My lord the glorious judge - may God prolong his life</p>
<p>4. and make eternal his power, his exaltedness, his loftiness, his sublimity, his eminence</p>
<p>5. and his majesty, and crush those who envy him and his enemies - has been sent a reply by the two witnesses,</p>
<p>6. reporting to him in order that the truth of what they state in their reply be ratified by</p>
<p>7. a rescript of the exalted, glorious,</p>
<p>8. trustworthy, majestic, resplendent, beautiful, honourable,</p>
<p>9. crowned presence of the judge, support of the commander of the faithful, may God establish his days and give power</p>
<p>10. to his judgments. An ʿalāma was attached to their document, according to the familiar</p>
<p>11. practice in such matters. The contents included mention of the reply given to him by the</p>
<p>12. jurisconsults authorized to make legal decisions concerning the endowment that I granted</p>
<p>13. to my deceased wife Kulla, daughter of Fahd, namely the portion of the said shops mentioned in the document headed by</p>
<p>14. my name, and her acceptance of that from me.</p>
<p>15. This endowment did not leave my possession and remained at my free disposal and in</p>
<p>16. my possession during her lifetime and this woman, to whom the endowment was made,</p>
<p>17. did not ratify it nor take possession of it, nor did she appoint a representative</p>
<p>18. as her agent. The accredited witnesses in the town of al-Fayyum</p>
<p>19. recognize the validity of what I have stated and testify to its truth. (It is my) request to him to</p>
<p>20. issue a rescript for them, confirming that they recognize this, together with his reply</p>
<p>21. to the substance of it. To him belongs his auspicious and rightly-guided resolution, if God, the exalted, wills.</p>
<p>22. Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muhammad, the prophet, and save him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>23. Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is he!</p>

                        <p>Praise be to God, in a way that satisfies him.</p>
<p>2. Let the group of accredited witnesses</p>
<p>3. in the town of al-Fayyum, may God cause their strength to endure, take cognizance</p>
<p>4. of this scroll, both inside and out,</p>
<p>5. and of the rescript issued by the exalted,</p>
<p>6. glorious, trustworthy, majestic,</p>
<p>7. resplendent, beautiful, honourable, crowned presence of the judge, support</p>
<p>8. of the commander of the faithful, may God establish his days and give power</p>
<p>9. to his judgments to me. (This is) pursuant to the reply</p>
<p>10. given to him by the jurisconsults, who are authorized to make legal decisions, may God cause</p>
<p>11. their strength to endure, and by those of them who knew anything</p>
<p>12. concerning what was related by the applicant </p>
<p>13. in his formal request for my rescript,</p>
<p>14. [ ] this [ ] the portion</p>
