Verso

Existing in your cities and the countryside and in …. 
laws and in the (statutes?)...
A neglected disperse, condemned as useless. 
A few [people], and they are not among us,
opposing our tradition and our religion,
Leaving them among us humiliates us.
and their removal, O master, adorns us.
For if our master counts the precious,
He can sell it to me worthless.

Recto

.. the soul is freed in vain...
... harm upon the Jews to destruction...
And he began to write blameworthy things...
And he said, “I will exhaust my ways among them.:
“And I will destroy for them the homes.” For when
he was alone with the oppressive king on a dark day;
A gloomy, ominous (cursed) day upon our ancestors,
disgraced, chosen from the craft
of the people. He said to him, “O obeyed king.”
