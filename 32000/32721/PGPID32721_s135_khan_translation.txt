In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
The blessings and benedictions of God, his increasing benefactions and most excellent salutation and greetings be

upon our lord and master, the ’imām al-Ḥāfiẓ li-Dīn Allāh, commander of the faithful,


and upon his pure ancestors and his most noble sons, with a blessing enduring until the day of judgement.


The slave kisses the ground before the lofty, mighty and glorious seat of the


most exalted lord, al-’Afḍal, commander of the armies, sword of Islam, thedefender, the protector of the judges


[of the Muslims and guide of the dā‘īs of the believers], may God perpetuate the dominion of him who holds it.
