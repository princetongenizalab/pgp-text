<li>and a half, which comes to three hundred and sixty-</li>
<li>five days and six hours in the year.</li>
<li>Each year there remains 6 hours, [and in four years</li>
<li>this comes to one day, and they make of it</li>
<li>a leap year] &hellip;.</li>
<li>The lunar months are of 29 days and a half</li>
<li>and two thirds of an hour and 73 parts, which make three</li>

<li>hours and 876 parts. Solar years</li>
<li>exceed lunar ones by 10 days, 21</li>
<li>hours and 204 parts. To find on which</li>
<li>(week)day their Kalends fall, let him take from Marheshvan</li>
<li>3 days, from Kislev 2 days, from Tevet 3 days,</li>
<li>from Shevat 3 days, from Adar in a leap year</li>
<li>1 day, from Nisan 3 days, and from all (other) months</li>

<li>how many years have gone into the 28-year cycle</li>
<li>and from each one take 1 day and another day from every four</li>
<li>years, add them all up, cast out the 7s, and see</li>
<li>how many are left. If 3 [are left, it will come</li>
<li>on Wednesday, if 2, on Tuesday, if 1, on Monday,</li>
<li>and so the whole week.] To find</li>
<li>when the first year falls,</li>
<li>[let him calculate from the year 4105 (344/5 CE)</li>
<li>which is year 1] of the count of the years of the cycles</li>
<li>of 28 and 19 years. To find</li>
<li>the molad according to their calculation, let him calculate the days of every</li>
<li>month, (starting) from January 31, February</li>
<li>28 or in a leap year 29, until the month</li>
<li>in which the molad of the moon occurs, and see how much</li>
<li>the solar month exceeds from</li>
