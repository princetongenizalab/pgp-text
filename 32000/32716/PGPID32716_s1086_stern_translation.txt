… will know the solar months
… each month has 30 days and 10 hours
and a half, which comes to three hundred and sixty-
five days and six hours in the year.
Each year there remains 6 hours, [and in four years
this comes to one day, and they make of it
a leap year] ….
The lunar months are of 29 days and a half
and two thirds of an hour and 73 parts, which make three
hundred and fifty-four days, eight
hours and 876 parts. Solar years
exceed lunar ones by 10 days, 21
hours and 204 parts. To find on which
(week)day their Kalends fall, let him take from Marheshvan
3 days, from Kislev 2 days, from Tevet 3 days,
from Shevat 3 days, from Adar in a leap year
1 day, from Nisan 3 days, and from all (other) months
take the days in excess
of 28 days, until the desired month.

For every desired month, let him calculate
how many years have gone into the 28-year cycle
and from each one take 1 day and another day from every four
years, add them all up, cast out the 7s, and see
how many are left. If 3 [are left, it will come
on Wednesday, if 2, on Tuesday, if 1, on Monday,
and so the whole week.] To find
when the first year falls,
[let him calculate from the year 4105 (344/5 CE)
which is year 1] of the count of the years of the cycles
of 28 and 19 years. To find
the molad according to their calculation, let him calculate the days of every
month, (starting) from January 31, February
28 or in a leap year 29, until the month
in which the molad of the moon occurs, and see how much
