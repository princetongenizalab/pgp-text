<li>The slave</li>
<li>al-Ḥasan b. Abū Saʿd&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate</li>
<li>May God, may he be exalted, prolong the days of the lofty, lordly, most noble, victorious,</li>
<li>just chamber, helper of the imāms, dispeller of sorrow, commander of the armies, sword of Islam,</li>
<li>succor of mankind, lord of the kings of the Arabs and non-Arabs, ruler of the two distinctions, the sword and the pen,</li>
<li>guarantor of the judges of the Muslims and guide of the emissaries of the believers, may God support the religion through him,</li>
<li>[and] benefit the commander of the believers by prolonging his existence, make his strength eternal and exalt his command.</li>
<li>He reports his weak state, delicate situation, and abundance of dependents and asks for a gracious</li>
<li>benefaction in employing him in the company of the brokers of pharmaceuticals as a merchant in the dār al-wakkāla in Fusṭāṭ on account of</li>
<li>of his experience and vigor (alt: by means of an injunction and its execution), since the (other) merchants are ruining him out of envy for his business (alt: query him on account of his expertise), and since the brokers</li>
<li>are discouraging him from carrying out (his tasks) by means of imposed rules. He is not undermining them something serving as witness for the something,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>but rather what some of the merchants are greedy for, nothing more. He asks for the entire 304 (?) that</li>
<li>the rest of the leaders employed in Fusṭāṭ in restraining the hand of the brokers from this, protecting him,</li>
<li>enfolding him in his favor and protecting him so that he may thereby live a new life as a benefaction to him and a favor &hellip;</li>
<li>To the lofty, lordly, most exalted, just, victorious chamber belongs the lofty opinion in this, if God wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God, and his prayers upon our lord Muḥammad, and peace</li>
