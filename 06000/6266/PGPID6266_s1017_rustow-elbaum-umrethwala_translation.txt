The slave
al-Ḥasan b. Abū Saʿd  
In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate
May God, may he be exalted, prolong the days of the lofty, lordly, most noble, victorious,
just chamber, helper of the imāms, dispeller of sorrow, commander of the armies, sword of Islam,
succor of mankind, lord of the kings of the Arabs and non-Arabs, ruler of the two distinctions, the sword and the pen,
guarantor of the judges of the Muslims and guide of the emissaries of the believers, may God support the religion through him,
[and] benefit the commander of the believers by prolonging his existence, make his strength eternal and exalt his command.
He reports his weak state, delicate situation, and abundance of dependents and asks for a gracious
benefaction in employing him in the company of the brokers of pharmaceuticals as a merchant in the dār al-wakkāla in Fusṭāṭ on account of
of his experience and vigor (alt: by means of an injunction and its execution), since the (other) merchants are ruining him out of envy for his business (alt: query him on account of his expertise), and since the brokers
are discouraging him from carrying out (his tasks) by means of imposed rules. He is not undermining them something serving as witness for the something,  
but rather what some of the merchants are greedy for, nothing more. He asks for the entire 304 (?) that
the rest of the leaders employed in Fusṭāṭ in restraining the hand of the brokers from this, protecting him,
enfolding him in his favor and protecting him so that he may thereby live a new life as a benefaction to him and a favor …
To the lofty, lordly, most exalted, just, victorious chamber belongs the lofty opinion in this, if God wills.
Praise be to God, and his prayers upon our lord Muḥammad, and peace
