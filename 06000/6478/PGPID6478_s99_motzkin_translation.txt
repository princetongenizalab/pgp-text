Recto


May the gracious and exalted patron R. Solomon, may his Rock preserve him


and come to his aid, be so kind as to fulfill his promise in regard to the Targum of Kings.


Should he not be able to do Kings, let it be the Targum of the Haftarahs.


Many thanks. He should not neglect the vowelled one. There is great need


for it . May he have much peace. The writing of his servant Solomon.
