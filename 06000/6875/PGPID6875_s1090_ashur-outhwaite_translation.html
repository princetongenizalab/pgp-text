<li>In Your name O Merciful One</li>
<li>His servant and his slave Joseph al-Ḥalabī</li>
<li>&lsquo;And the light shall shine upon your ways&rsquo; (Job 22:29)</li>
<li>May he be declared the righteous one of his community, may good things whirl about without number</li>
<li>joining up with blessings and boons &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; like a goodly tree,</li>
<li>like splendid foliage, like clusters of vines. An expert in fine detail</li>
<li>and in hidden and recondite matters, a guardian of commandments and laws</li>
<li>older than the world by many years, a tamarisk firmly rooted in the chain of</li>
<li>tradition of worthy ancestors, a teacher at the pinnacle of instruction, of knowledge</li>
<li>that grows mighty like springs. From his wisdom, the wise become wiser,</li>
<li>and from his insight, the discerning gain understanding of His two-thousand-year-old creation.</li>
<li>Like the one &lsquo;accepted of the multitude of his brethren&rsquo;, born from the belly of the one who watches at the doors of sound wisdom</li>
<li>and he who upholds paths for guiding the righteous. Good and pleasant is his name in the mouths of</li>
<li>all who lead the way &ndash; they have presented their witnesses &ndash; and all those who glorify his righteousness.</li>
<li>Like a river running down from Eden, thereafter splitting up to become four rivers,</li>
<li>let God not cause the waters of his wisdom to dry up, nor bring low the source of</li>
<li>his insight. A tree planted by the channels of the rivers, his leaves be for balm.</li>
<li>The honourable, great, holy, our master and our teacher Moses, the Distinguished Rav,</li>
<li>[the Mighty Hammer,] the Western Lamp, Banner of the Rabbanites, Unique One of the Generation and its Wonder,&hellip;</li>
