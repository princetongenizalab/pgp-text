Thus: Abū] al-Faraj ha-Levi (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Yeshu‘a ha-Levi, the beloved, …. [came before us]</li><li>[…] Eleazar the beloved youth b. M(r.) Amram</li><li>[…] the partnership (shirka) which</li><li>was between us … […] ... was medicine in the market … and each of us received every claim and demand</li><li>which he had upon the other, and no claim or demand remained for either of us with the  other, neither a claim nor a demand, neither a debt,</li><li>nor a pledge, nor a consignment, neither a bill of exchange nor a surety, neither a claim upon a partnership (shirka) nor a joint enterprise (mu‘āmala),</li><li>nor a loan nor a commenda (qirāḍ), neither a claim for an item of trade nor for merchandise, neither a claim for profit</li><li>nor for loss, neither for capital nor for profit, nor for any of the other types of</li><li>its differences of opinion, or of differences in its types or circumstances. Each of us has released</li><li>the other from the obligatory “oath of partners,” incumbent upon one to the other, in this partnership (shirka), as well as other (partnerships),</li><li>and from all the claims and demands, and from the rest of the connections and responsibilities for which each</li><li>of us has (a claim) upon the other, in this partnership (shirka) or in another, from the beginning of time up until now, a</li><li>total, complete, conclusive, correct release, upon each of us and upon our heirs after us, for the other and for his heirs</li><li>after him, with the most certain and perfect stipulations of release. Each of us has released the other from all</li><li>types of oaths, vows and rider oaths which (Jewish) law might require for each</li><li>of us with respect to the other concerning that which has been mentioned above, or in other matters, and even rider oaths</li><li>and even ḥerem setam. Each of us has forgiven the other any claim which (Jewish) law would place upon him,</li><li>with com[plete] forgiveness, and each of us has nullified any determination or interpretation before us</li><li>[… from that which this release includes, or secret dispositions concerning secret dispositions</li><li>[…] to the end of all secret dispositions. We performed a qinyan with Abū al-Riḍā al Levi, and with Abū (al-Faraj)</li><li>[…] the two of them for all that which this document includes</li><li>[…] with an item suitable for doing so, effective immediately, in accordance with our intent</li><li>[…] and that which happened before us, we wrote and signed</li><li>[…] Everything is proper and clear and enduring.</li><li>[... b.] Jacob the Teacher (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li></ol>
