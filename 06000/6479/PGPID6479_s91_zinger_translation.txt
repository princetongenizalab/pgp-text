Recto


(1-3) On Thursday, 6 Nissan 1396 AG (=9 April 1085 CE) according to the dating to which we are accustomed in Fustat-Mitzrayim, situated upon the River Nile, 

 
 

someone came (before the court) and mentioned that [[the wi(fe)]] the divorcee of Ṣāliḥ has been entering his house. Ṣāliḥ,


who used to be her husband, came forth and complained that she attacks him and enters 


his dwellings, saying: "I will not leave nor go out of this house for 


it is my house and my dwelling." We sent for her, summoned her, and forbade her


from entering the dwelling of her divorcee. However, she said: "I do not accept this. You 


took a bribe to divorce me (from him). The house is my house and I will not 


leave it. Otherwise, I will bring this to the government! [...]” 


She spoke of (committing) enormities. To anyone who addressed her, she responded with 


threats and curses. On his part, her divorcee, Ṣāliḥ, (continued) protesting, 


saying: "Relieve me of the burden of her entering my house." 


We wrote down what took place before us and signed it so it will be (testimony of) right and evidence.
