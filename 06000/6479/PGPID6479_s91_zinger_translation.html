<li>
<p>(1-3) On Thursday, 6 Nissan 1396 AG (=9 April 1085 CE) according to the dating to which we are accustomed in Fustat-Mitzrayim, situated upon the River Nile,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>someone came (before the court) and mentioned that [[the wi(fe)]] the divorcee of Ṣāliḥ has been entering his house. Ṣāliḥ,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who used to be her husband, came forth and complained that she attacks him and enters&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his dwellings, saying: "I will not leave nor go out of this house for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is my house and my dwelling." We sent for her, summoned her, and forbade her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from entering the dwelling of her divorcee. However, she said: "I do not accept this. You&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>took a bribe to divorce me (from him). The house is my house and I will not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leave it. Otherwise, I will bring this to the government! [...]&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She spoke of (committing) enormities. To anyone who addressed her, she responded with&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>threats and curses. On his part, her divorcee, Ṣāliḥ, (continued) protesting,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>saying: "Relieve me of the burden of her entering my house."&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wrote down what took place before us and signed it so it will be (testimony of) right and evidence.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
