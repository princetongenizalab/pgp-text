<p>ln (your name, O Mercifu)l</p>
<p>"Happy is he who is thoughtful of the wretched; in bad times may the Lord keep him (from harm)" (Psalm 41:2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>God the ex(alted) knows the state the slave of your excellency the nagid, may your rule be established forever, is in. I inform your highness about my situation, my poverty and indigence, my desolation and illness. I ask you kindly, may God perpetuate your strength, to help me during this noble holiday with something with which I may celebrate. Your slave, were he no[t] confined to the house, unable to go out on account of the poll tax and had he not been sick for eight months, would have been able to earn a living. Help would free me from complaining. You are suited to do this. May the holy one, blessed be He, double your reward and be your succor and grant you a (good) e[nd] and hope. And may your excellency's welfare increase and not diminish. And so may it be His will.&nbsp;</p>
