[...] Mr. Meshulam [told us]: “This 


[woman] is my relative and I must [...] her. Whatever the court charges her, 


I will pay it for her. I take it upon myself willingly and by my choice."

for what it contains for the six years written in the Jewish deed which is in the possession of her divorcee 


and she causes him damage, whether it will be little or much, pennyworth or more, I will provide it to him 


for her from the best of my possessions. I hereby undertake the surety for him upon me and my heirs

[to be] (a testimony of) right and evidence. Therefore, [we, the c]ourt and those [under]signed with us, performed the symbolic purchase 


from Meshullam [son of ...,] m(ay he rest in) E(den), a complete and rigorous purchase 


[... not like pro]mises [and not like formularies…
