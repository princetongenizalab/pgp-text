                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>[...] Mr. Meshulam [told us]: &ldquo;This&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[woman] is my relative and I must [...] her. Whatever the court charges her,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will pay it for her. I take it upon myself willingly and by my choice."&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We therefore told him: "She must submit the deed of maintenance in her possession written in Muslim courts&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the court and tear it up for her divorcee Mr. Ṭoviyya." He (i.e. Meshulam) said: "She lost the deed of maintenance&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and there is no way to submit it now. However, make the symbolic purchase from me and be my witness, instead of her, that if ever&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she, or her agent, submits this deed of maintenance to Muslim courts and sues him (i.e. Ṭoviyya)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for what it contains for the six years written in the Jewish deed which is in the possession of her divorcee&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and she causes him damage, whether it will be little or much, pennyworth or more, I will provide it to him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for her from the best of my possessions. I hereby undertake the surety for him upon me and my heirs&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after me for what remains of the aforementioned six years." Mr. Ṭoviyya was satisfied with&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[th]is and said to us: &ldquo;I ask the court to re[cord] this for me from Mr. Meshullam&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[...] to protect me with all precautions and that the court [will write me] about this a legal deed (maʿase)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[to be] (a testimony of) right and evidence. Therefore, [we, the c]ourt and those [under]signed with us, performed the symbolic purchase&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from Meshullam [son of ...,] m(ay he rest in) E(den), a complete and rigorous purchase&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[... not like pro]mises [and not like formularies&hellip;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
