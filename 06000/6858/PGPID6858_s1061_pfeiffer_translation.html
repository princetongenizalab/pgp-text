<li>
<p>We, the undersigned witnesses, say what we know and testify to, an</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>irrefutable testimony about what is the custom in Miṣr between&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>merchants (al-ʿāda bi-Miṣr bayna al-tujjār) regarding shirka: If a group of them enters either</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a dār wakāla or a merchants&rsquo; warehouse (makhzan tujjār) and they examine the merchandise or evaluate it before one of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>buys it, then they are (indeed) indicating to one another that [they have undertaken a partnership]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in it (the merchandise), and one of them may buy [the merchandise] and sell [it &hellip; while registering]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the names of those who indicated to him (that they will form a partnership) with him in the register of the representative of the merchants or the register [of the merchants] (daftar al-wakīl aw al-t[ujjār]?). [But if]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they say to a broker, &ldquo;He (A) is buying this for them&rdquo; and either (A) comes along [to]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his associate (ṣāḥib = B) and says to him in the street &ndash; neither at the dār al-wakāla [nor at the merchants&rsquo; warehouse] &ndash;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I saw some goods in such-and-such a place,&rdquo; and he had evaluated them with such-and-such a broker,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(if A says,) &ldquo;If I buy them, pay me half or some (of the capital),&rdquo; and (B) replies to him,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;OK, if you buy them, I will pay you,&rdquo; and then (A) goes and buys them after</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this, but no one is with him either when he pays or when he concludes the transaction, rather,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with his money he alone bought it for himself&mdash;then (B) has the choice. If he wants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to pay (A), he can pay him, but if he doesn&rsquo;t want to, then he doesn&rsquo;t (have to) pay anything. The custom is that (B) should pay&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>something only as a favor that he grants, not as an obligation incumbent upon him (because it&rsquo;s not an official partnership). It has been like this for some</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time, as well when merchandise is broken, or there appears in it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some defect, or there is a technical fault in ownership: (A) can&rsquo;t say to his associate, &ldquo;You lose with me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fault in ownership doesn&rsquo;t lie with me,&rdquo; since each of them had the choice for himself (of whether to accept it as a valid partnership, since it wasn&rsquo;t legally binding in the first place). When he asked us (to testify about) what we</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knew, we testified to it in the middle decade of Iyyar, 1452 Sel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Fustat, Egypt. Confirmed, valid and enduring. Shelomo ha-Kohen Bar Yosef Zetzel.</p>
