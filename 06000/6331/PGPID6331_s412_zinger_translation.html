                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>The testimony which took place before us, we, the undersigned, thus: ʿAmāʾim bt. Mr. Berakhot,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the elder, m(ay he rest in) E(den), mentioned in this ketubba, came before us and called upon us to witness concerning her with neither duress, nor&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>force nor compulsion, that she has received and accepted all of the dowry ascribed to her as owed by&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her husband, Mr. Solomon ha-Kohen b. ʿObadya ha-Kohen, m(ay he rest in) E(den), in this ketubba except for three items&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and no more. These items are: the copper lamp, the bucket, and the embroidered Iranian pillow.&nbsp; She released him,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as of now, as long as he lives and his heirs after him, from any attachment, demand and responsibility she is&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>owed by him in this matter, and from any demand over belayot or over any item, and from all oaths and even a general&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ban, a complete and total release. Nothing of the dowry which she brought into the marriage contained in this&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ketubba remains as his debt to her, except these three items, nothing more.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They remain as his debt to her with the rest of her delayed marriage gift, since she did not relinquish any of it, because it was&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with his desire and will that he gave her the aforementioned dowry items. We made the symbolic purchase about this,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after affirming her identity, with a complete and rigorous purchase with an instrument fitting for purchase, as of now,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cancelling any notifications and conditions. The one who verified her identity to us was Faḍāʾil son of Abū Saʿīd,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may (the Rock) pre(serve him), b. Yakhīn, the cantor, m(ay he rest in) E(den).&nbsp; Then, we also made the symbolic purchase from her husband, the aforementioned Mr. Solomon ha-Kohen, with a&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complete and rigorous purchase with an instrument fitting for purchase, as of now, cancelling any notifications and conditions that he will not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deprive her of any of her delayed marriage gift. All of it remains as his debt to her with the&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three items mentioned above. He gave her the the dowry items willingly, from which&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she has now released him. She has full disposition (taṣarruf) with it (i.e. the dowry items) as she chooses. No&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attachment to it (i.e. to the dowry items) nor objection remains for him against her. He will not beat her and will keep good companionship&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with her. We wrote and signed this testimony so it will be for both of them a proof and evidence. We have also registered&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the symbolic purchase from both of them in a deed given to the aforementioned Mr. Solomon ha-Kohen.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All this took place in the last ten days of the month of Ṭevet, 1443AG (=1132CE),&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>according to the dating of deeds, in Fustat-Mitzrayim situated upon the River Nile under the authority&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of our lord Maṣliaḥ ha-Kohen, head of the Academy of the Pride (Gaon) of Jacob, may he live forever. True, clear and established.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nathan ha-Kohen b. Solomom ha-Kohen, m(ay he rest in the) G(arden of) E(den). M(onth of) Ṭ(evet) y(ear) 1443AG (=1132AD).</p>
<p>Meshullam b. Menasse, he-ḥaver, (may his) E(nd be) G(ood).</p>
<p>Nathan b. Samuel, he-ḥaver, (the) M(emory of the) R(ighteous be) B(lessed).</p>
