[I will] send it with whomever you come to an agreement with and I will give him


the price of fodder for two nights. I told him 


it wasn’t possible for you to send 


today what you had refused—


to send saddles and reins—out of your fear


that you will be displeased. I rented 


a donkey from Qalyūb to Shatanuf toward the place of


the //auspicious// barges. We sped and stayed


 several days [on the barge] and on the Nile we endured


 various hardships. When we reached


 Manūf, the ruler (al-Malik al-Afḍal) //may God perpetuate his reign// embarked on the barge, and 


my lord embarked with him, as well as my lord the elder


Abū l-Mufaḍḍal, and we proceeded toward al-Maḥalla. I stayed 


 on the barge and stayed ….


 the guide. I did not find anyone


 with whom to send a letter. This


is the reason I have ceased sending you my letters. When


 my lord returned from al-Maḥalla,


 I wrote a letter and sent it with 


 Salāma al-Shirjī, but it was brief,


 and I wasn’t able to 


 inform him because time was short. With regard


 to textiles that I had


to get to al-Maḥalla,


 I haven’t done so, but 


have included them along with other textiles.


I have acquainted myself with everything


in your letter and have taken cognizance of it. Another letter


 from you also reached us, and I understood


 ... . Deceit with


 the elder Abū Sulaymān Dāwūd and what 


you had asked to safeguard …. 


It is safeguarded in a trunk.


As for my lord the elder Abū l-Mufaḍḍal,


may God grant him a long life, I am grateful for his immense benevolence


may God the exalted reward him bountifully and not


deprive me of his benefactions and perpetuate


his diligence for my requests


and all my matters. My regards to you


and to whoever expands your eminence.


My regards to your wife.


Inform her of my immense longing towards her.


Kiss on my behalf the hand of my master the Rayyis….

We entered Alexandria and it was []day


And my master wrote explaining


everything and my master lent Abū l-Mufaḍḍal


a mule, and gave me his donkey. And we are aware of


what happened to the Frankish female slave and I have already told you


What is required and I know you have entrusted


Urjuwān (purple cloth)with Abū l-Afrāḥ (ʿArus b. Yosef)


and also garments and all of which you have instructed me


about, I will enact and inform you about….


my matters and regards. 


I wish to inform you about what happened to the wife of al-Shaykh


Abū Saʿīd. Praise be to God for what happened


for the death of the female child, it was inevitable, may God in return give


a male child soon and we congratulate them f


or her delivery and congratulate them on my behalf 


for her delivery and regards.
