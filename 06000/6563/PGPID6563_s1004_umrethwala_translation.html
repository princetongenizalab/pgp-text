                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>
<p>&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[I will] send it with whomever you come to an agreement with and I will give him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price of fodder for two nights, and I told him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t possible for you to send&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>today what you had denied -&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to send saddles and reins - for the fear from you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you will be displeased. And I rented&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a donkey from Qalyūb to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shatanof towards the place of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the //noble// barges and we sped and stayed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;several days [on the barge] and endured on the Nile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;several hardships. When we reached</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Manūf, the Mālik (Malik al-Afḍal)//may God perpetuate his reign// embarked the barge, and embarked&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;with him my master, and my master al-shaykh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Abū l-Mufaḍḍal and [we] proceeded towards al-Maḥalla. And I stayed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;on the barge and stayed &hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the guide. It did not find anyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;to send a letter with and this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;is the reason for my letters cutting off from you. And when</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;my master returned from al-Maḥalla</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;I wrote a letter and sent it with&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Salāma al-Shirjī but it was brief,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and I wasn&rsquo;t able to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;inform him because of the shortage in time. And with regard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;to textiles, which were</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;upon me to get it to al-Maḥalla,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t done so but&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;have included it along other textiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;And I have acquainted myself with everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;In your letter and have taken cognizance of it. Another letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;from you also reached us, and I understood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. And deceit with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;al-Shaykh Abū Sulaymān Dāwūd and what&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;You had asked to safeguard&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;It is safeguarded in a trunk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;And my Master al-Shaykh Abū l-Mufaḍḍal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;May God grant him a long life, I am grateful for his immense benevolence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;May God the Almighty reward him bountifully and not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;deprive me of his grace and make permanent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;his diligence for my requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and all of my matters. My regards to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and to whomever expands your eminence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;My regards to your wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;And inform her about my immense longing towards her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;And kiss on my behalf the hand of my master the Rayyis&hellip;.</p>
