                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>
<p>&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[I will] send it with whomever you come to an agreement with and I will give him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price of fodder for two nights. I told him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it wasn&rsquo;t possible for you to send&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>today what you had refused&mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to send saddles and reins&mdash;out of your fear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you will be displeased. I rented&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a donkey from Qalyūb to Shatanuf toward the place of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the //auspicious// barges. We sped and stayed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;several days [on the barge] and on the Nile we endured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;various hardships. When we reached</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Manūf, the ruler (al-Malik al-Afḍal) //may God perpetuate his reign// embarked on the barge, and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord embarked with him, as well as my lord the elder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū l-Mufaḍḍal, and we proceeded toward al-Maḥalla. I stayed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;on the barge and stayed &hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the guide. I did not find anyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;with whom to send a letter. This</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is the reason I have ceased sending you my letters. When</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;my lord returned from al-Maḥalla,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;I wrote a letter and sent it with&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Salāma al-Shirjī, but it was brief,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and I wasn&rsquo;t able to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;inform him because time was short. With regard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;to textiles that I had</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to get to al-Maḥalla,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;I haven&rsquo;t done so, but&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have included them along with other textiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have acquainted myself with everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in your letter and have taken cognizance of it. Another letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;from you also reached us, and I understood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;... . Deceit with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the elder Abū Sulaymān Dāwūd and what&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you had asked to safeguard &hellip;.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is safeguarded in a trunk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for my lord the elder Abū l-Mufaḍḍal,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God grant him a long life, I am grateful for his immense benevolence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God the exalted reward him bountifully and not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deprive me of his benefactions and perpetuate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his diligence for my requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and all my matters. My regards to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and to whoever expands your eminence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My regards to your wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform her of my immense longing towards her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kiss on my behalf the hand of my master the Rayyis&hellip;.</p>

<li>
<p>We entered Alexandria and it was []day</p>

<li>
<p>And my master wrote explaining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everything and my master lent Abū l-Mufaḍḍal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a mule, and gave me his donkey. And we are aware of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what happened to the Frankish female slave and I have already told you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is required and I know you have entrusted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Urjuwān (purple cloth)with Abū l-Afrāḥ (ʿArus b. Yosef)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and also garments and all of which you have instructed me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about, I will enact and inform you about&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my matters and regards.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish to inform you about what happened to the wife of al-Shaykh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū Saʿīd. Praise be to God for what happened</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the death of the female child, it was inevitable, may God in return give</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a male child soon and we congratulate them f</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or her delivery and congratulate them on my behalf&nbsp;</p>
