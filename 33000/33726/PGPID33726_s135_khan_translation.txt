In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  


The witnesses named in this document, all of them knowing Ṣadaqa ibn ʿAlūn ibn  al-Dabbāb,  


 the Jew, with a legally valid knowledge, not having need to ask about him or  inquire concerning anything relating to him, testified that Ṣadaqa ibn ʿAlūn, known  


as ibn al-Dabbāb, has died in Maʿarrat al-Nuʿmān after the death of his son Bū  Faraj in the town of Latakia and that he has not  


left anyone having rights to his inheritance except his daughter Yamānī, the wife  of Mawhūb ibn Bashār. They attached thereto  


their testimonies, while being in sound health and their actions being legal, on the  fifth of Shawwāl of the year four-hundred and twenty-seven.
