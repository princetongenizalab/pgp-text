May God make eternal the reign of the exalted seat, the [mighty] lord, [(commander of) the armies, sword (of Islam),]


the defender (of mankind), the protector (of judges of the Muslims), the guide (of the dā’īs of the believers), and strengthen the religion through him and by his long life give comfort


to the commander of the faithful, cause his power to endure and exalt his prestige and his word. The slave kisses the ground and reports


to his master (that) his situation is straitened and lowly on account of the burden of his expenses and his family and that the slave


has returned from noble service in the border post of Ascalon, may God, he is exalted, protect it, after


exhibiting vigour and a forceful spirit, obedience to God and obedience


to his master, and (after) his fighting the accursed enemy and the gratitude of the leaders for his service


and energy, and their recognition of the valour that he exhibited ...
