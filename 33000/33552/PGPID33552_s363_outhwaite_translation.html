<li>‘Cries of grace, grace’ (Zech 4:7) to the stone of grace, ‘who sits in judgement’ (Isa 28:6),  </li>
<li>our master and our teacher Moses the Judge, Bet Din, may he be made fruitful, gifts  </li>
<li>of wellbeing from me, your friend. Now, I have arrived at ‘a town  </li>
<li>on the edge of your territory’ (Num 20:16), wishing you peace and prosperity </li>
<li>forever, and in great shame and disgrace my times have cast me down </li>
<li>into the current evil ‘and I cannot flee’ (Gen 19:19) and a ship</li>
<li>brought us here against our will. And God has commanded us to hurry</li>
<li>‘until the Lord from heaven looks down and sees’ (Lam 3:50). […]</li>
<li>Yexi’el, the least of Israel, son of the scholar Elyaqim  </li>
