<p>... the noble, prophetic (dynasty), may (God) extend its life, over&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all the Christians dwelling in his dominion and living&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[in ] the provinces of his kingdom, in order that he may execute&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their inheritances as required by his statements and pronouncements, both in their general principles and in their specific stipulations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commander of the faithful is the most worthy person to execute the instructions of his ancestor and to act&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>upon his noble and glorious deeds, which are found in his noble and glorious sunna,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to water what he has planted and to elevate what he has built and founded.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has executed in a glorious and magnificent manner the instructions of this&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gracious decree.'&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has made these Christians conform&nbsp;</p>

<p>his sacred and established principles.</p>

<p>He assumes the responsibility for the welfare of the members of minority groups and of dimmīs. He offers&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consideration and justice to the weak man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that he may be equal to the strong. He has delegated the present authority to them&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the basis of the precedent set by his ancestors [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]&nbsp;</p>

<p>in their time to follow (this precedent) and to continue to act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as is customary, in the knowledge that they are the representatives of God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on earth. He, praise him, has granted&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>them the power to extend or restrain.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who are close to them are clothed in their justice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and they have concern and care for all their subjects irrespective of rank.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this open decree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the instructions issued by al-Mustansir&nbsp;</p>

<p>and by al-'Āmir - God increase them in loftiness, pre-eminence,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>sublime nobility, glory and splendour for us - have been specified, by virtue of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;] the pure, holy presence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ] ... consideration of executing them,</p>

<p>and assuming responsibility for implementing the wish of his caliphal throne</p>

<p>and the power of his kingdom, in accordance with what has been specified in this&nbsp;decree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and also with precedents and analogous cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is because the commands of his ancestors, the pure 'imāms,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the blessings of God be upon them all, require</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>obedience, and their examples (of conduct), while being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>visible or hidden, are binding and irrefragable, since they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>derive from their kind consideration for everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and express their fine resolutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of sympathy [ ] and mercy.</p>
