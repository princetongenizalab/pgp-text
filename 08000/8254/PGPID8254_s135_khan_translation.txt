... the noble, prophetic (dynasty), may (God) extend its life, over 


all the Christians dwelling in his dominion and living 


[in ] the provinces of his kingdom, in order that he may execute 


their inheritances as required by his statements and pronouncements, both in their general principles and in their specific stipulations. 


The commander of the faithful is the most worthy person to execute the instructions of his ancestor and to act 


…


upon his noble and glorious deeds, which are found in his noble and glorious sunna, 


to water what he has planted and to elevate what he has built and founded. 


He has executed in a glorious and magnificent manner the instructions of this 


gracious decree.' 


He has made these Christians conform 


to his mighty judgments and strengthened 


his sacred and established principles.
