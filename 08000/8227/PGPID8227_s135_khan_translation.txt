This is what ʿAlī ibn Ḥassān ibn Maʿālī al-Tarābulusī, the sewer of skins, who on  this day is a middle-aged man, pure reddy-brown in complexion,  


with a smooth forehead, in which there are some wrinkles, with light hair  between the eyebrows, with dark brown eyes, a hooked nosed, a round beard and with the top right incisor missing,

one of the supervisors of the office of prosperous Friday and neighbourhood  mosques. He leased from him, with one clapping of the hands and one contract, 


all of the small house within the garden known by (the name of) Zaytūn, which  was itself excluded from this lease,  


in Fusṭāṭ - Miṣr, in Birkat Ramīs, adjoining Kawm Dīnār, (Kawm) al-Mashānīq,  


the shore of the blessed Nile and various (other) places. It is the small house within the garden,  


with a door with an arched vault, a corridor, a lower courtyard, a living room with a fountain in the middle,  


with upper apartments, together with amenities and rights. This is well know in the area and can be easily identified,

of Dhū al-Qaʿda of the year five-hundred and thirty-one and its end the final day of Shawwāl  


of the year five-hundred and thirty-five, may God allow him to attain that in  prosperity, health, security and safety,  


for a rent amounting in this period, in cash, of good alloy and assayed, 


to thirty two dīnārs, at a rate of a quarter in each year thereof, that is eight dīnārs, and per month,  


two thirds of a dīnār of good quality, a valid and operative lease, this rent being repayable by this lessee in instalments,  


which he undertakes to pay to this lessor monthly, an instalment at the end of every month, without delay, withholding,  


protesting with any argument, pretext, oath or litigation, after completion of this agreement, inspection (of the property),  


handing over and (granting of) a warranty against defect in title. The  acknowledgement by the elder Thiqat al-Mulk Ṣanīʿat [al-Dawla,]
