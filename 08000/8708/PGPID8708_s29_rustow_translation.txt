Recto

His excellency the glorious elder, 
may our God protect him and keep him alive, beloved one,
the student, propitiation of the yeshiva, may his Rock protect him,
who has studied what the sages of the Torah
of blessed memory have made obligatory in the case of charity. They have said:
Deeds are greater than the doer. And [they] have add[ed]
about charity: this good deed [is equal to]
them all. Please rule in accordance with what ...
his generosity: Seeing as a certain Karīm the tax-farmer
has sold the sycamore and the lotus, and provisionally (sold)
some of the date-palms. The tax-farm yielded 
nothing (from the trees this year?). He has 2¼ dīnārs from 
last year. For the poor, there is nothing
but God, the exalted, and you. He lives in luxury
and behaves like an amīr, transferring to himself what
is collected on his watch. It is unfair of him to transfer
(funds) from the tax-farm.
May his (the recipient's) peace
increase.
