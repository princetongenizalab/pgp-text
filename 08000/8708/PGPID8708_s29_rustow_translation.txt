Recto

His excellency the glorious elder, 
may our God protect him and preserve his beloved (son),
the scholar, propitiation of the yeshiva, may his Rock protect him.
Know what the sages of the Torah
of blessed memory have ruled with regard to charity. They have said:
"He who induces others to act is greater than he who acts." Please add
to your (previous) benefactions this benefaction, [which will be equal to]
them all. Please strive in accordance with what (is required by)
your generosity. A certain Karīm the tax-farmer
has sold my sycamores and the ziziphus trees, and provisionally (sold)
some of my date-palms, but has not yielded anything (to me) from the tax-farm.
He has 2¼ dīnārs from 
last year. The poor have no one (to help them)
but God, the exalted, and you. Therefore, act generously
and instruct him, with the receipt of (the order) you will issue,
(to transfer to me) what he has collected and may yet collect
from the tax-farm.
May his (the recipient's) peace
increase.
