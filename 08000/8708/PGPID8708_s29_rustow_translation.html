<li>His excellency the glorious elder,&nbsp;</li>
<li>may our God protect him and keep him alive, beloved one,</li>
<li>the student, propitiation of the yeshiva, may his Rock protect him,</li>
<li>who has studied what the sages of the Torah</li>
<li>of blessed memory have made obligatory in the case of charity. They have said:</li>
<li>Deeds are greater than the doer. And [they] have add[ed]</li>
<li>about charity: this good deed [is equal to]</li>
<li>them all. Please rule in accordance with what ...</li>
<li>his generosity: Seeing as a certain Kar카m the tax-farmer</li>
<li>has sold the sycamore and the lotus, and provisionally (sold)</li>
<li>some of the date-palms. The tax-farm yielded&nbsp;</li>
<li>nothing (from the trees this year?). He has 2&frac14; d카n훮rs from&nbsp;</li>
<li>last&nbsp;year. For the poor, there is nothing</li>
<li>but God, the exalted, and you. He lives in luxury</li>
<li>and behaves like an am카r, transferring to himself what</li>
<li>is collected on his watch. It is unfair of him to transfer</li>
<li>(funds) from the tax-farm.</li>
<li>May his (the recipient's) peace</li>
<li>increase.</li>
