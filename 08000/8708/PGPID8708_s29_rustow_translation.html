                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>His excellency the glorious elder,&nbsp;</li>
<li>may our God protect him and preserve his beloved (son),</li>
<li>the scholar, propitiation of the yeshiva, may his Rock protect him.</li>
<li>Know what the sages of the Torah</li>
<li>of blessed memory have ruled with regard to charity. They have said:</li>
<li>"He who induces others to act is greater than he who acts." Please add</li>
<li>to your (previous) benefactions this benefaction, [which will be equal to]</li>
<li>them all. Please strive in accordance with what (is required by)</li>
<li>your generosity. A certain Karīm the tax-farmer</li>
<li>has sold my sycamores and the ziziphus trees, and provisionally (sold)</li>
<li>some of my date-palms, but has not yielded anything (to me) from the tax-farm.</li>
<li>He has 2&frac14; dīnārs from&nbsp;</li>
<li>last year. The poor have no one (to help them)</li>
<li>but God, the exalted, and you. Therefore, act generously</li>
<li>and instruct him, with the receipt of (the order) you will issue,</li>
<li>(to transfer to me) what he has collected and may yet collect</li>
<li>from the tax-farm.</li>
<li>May his (the recipient's) peace</li>
<li>increase.</li>
</ol>
