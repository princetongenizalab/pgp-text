The slave


Makārim ibn 'Isḥāq, the doctor.


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


(The slave) kisses the ground and reports that he is a trained and able practitioner in the profession


of medicine. The two doctors of our master the sultan, al-Rašīd al-Dimašqī and al-Rašīd


’Abū Ḥulayqa, attest to the excellence of the slave's knowledge in this profession. He makes


a request before our lord the sultan, may God make great his victory, of the gift


of the remainder of the salary of al-’As‘ad, the doctor in the hospital of Cairo,


that is three dInars every month, (paid) to the slave for him to practise


the treatment of the sick and let the prayer (of the slave) [for] our lord the sultan be answered. The resolution (of the sultan) is exalted.


Praise be to God alone and his blessings [be upon our lord] Muhammad and his family and save them.
