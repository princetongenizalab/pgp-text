Recto

I(n your name)
I previously sent letters to my lord, the most glorious
elder — may God prolong his existence in health and make eternal
his support, happiness, wellbeing, benefaction,
high rank, strength and splendor and vanquish with humiliation
and ignominy those who envy him and his enemies, and never deprive him
of the good of success — in which I explained to you all
the matters and circumstances. I won't expand on it except to day
that I long for you, may God bring our reunion near
