Recto

I(n your name)
I previously sent letters to my lord, the most glorious
elder — may God prolong his existence in health and make eternal
his support, happiness, wellbeing, benefaction,
high rank, strength and splendor and vanquish with humiliation
and ignominy those who envy him and his enemies, and never deprive him
of the good of success — in which I explained to you all
the matters and circumstances. I won't expand on it except to day
that I long for you, may God bring our reunion near 
in the most preferable circumstances and the greatest expectations in his benefaction
and abundance of kindness, since he is responsible for this and has the power to bring it about, 
if God wills in his mercy. I also informed you 
in them of all the prices of the goods that
I need to send back to you. But I would like, if 
this is stuitable to you, for frankincense and brazilwood to be sent immediately following*
the monsoon, if the good brazilwood goes for 120 dinars
per bale and the frankincense for 20 dinars
per qinṭār and 20 raṭls. If you don't have anything
with you and frankincense is available, enter into a qirāḍ with

the dīwān
and buy some,
as well as a bit of camphor
for 20 dinars per mann. But 
prices are in the hands of God the exalted.
As for the rest, when 
there was unloaded for them what was unloaded*
from the ship the Dībājī,
some the items came to ʿAydhāb,
and some remained in Suwākin.
They ran out of time 
and Abū l-Karam the wakīl
passed over * the rest.
Each person's name
is on a line-item*
but the name of Shemuʾel is
on all of them, and also 
on a line-item.

Some news arrived
that pepper, lac and brazilwood
arrived in ʿAydhāb
and the wakīl claimed them
and they're with him and with the Muslims
who are going up to claim
their items*. Nahrāy
is also going up.
I would like for
