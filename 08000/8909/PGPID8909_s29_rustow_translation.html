<li>I(n your name)</li>
<li>I previously sent letters to my lord, the most glorious</li>
<li>elder &mdash; may God prolong his existence in health and make eternal</li>
<li>his support, happiness, wellbeing, benefaction,</li>
<li>high rank, strength and splendor and vanquish with humiliation</li>
<li>and ignominy those who envy him and his enemies,&nbsp;and never deprive him</li>
<li>of the good of success &mdash;â€¯in which I explained to you all</li>
<li>the matters and circumstances. I won't expand on it except to day</li>
<li>that I long for you, may God bring our reunion near&nbsp;</li>
