<li>I(n your name)</li>
<li>I previously sent letters to my lord, the most glorious</li>
<li>elder &mdash; may God prolong his existence in health and make eternal</li>
<li>his support, happiness, wellbeing, benefaction,</li>
<li>high rank, strength and splendor and vanquish with humiliation</li>
<li>and ignominy those who envy him and his enemies,&nbsp;and never deprive him</li>
<li>of the good of success &mdash; in which I explained to you all</li>
<li>the matters and circumstances. I won't expand on it except to day</li>
<li>that I long for you, may God bring our reunion near&nbsp;</li>
<li>in the most preferable circumstances and the greatest expectations in his benefaction</li>
<li>and abundance of kindness, since he is responsible for this and has the power to bring it about,&nbsp;</li>
<li>if God wills in his mercy. I also informed you&nbsp;</li>
<li>in them of all the prices of the goods that</li>
<li>I need to send back to you. But I would like, if&nbsp;</li>
<li>this is stuitable to you, for frankincense and brazilwood to be sent immediately following*</li>
<li>the monsoon, if the good brazilwood goes for 120 dinars</li>
<li>per bale and the frankincense for 20 dinars</li>
<li>per qinṭār and 20 raṭls. If you don't have anything</li>
<li>with you and frankincense is available, enter into a qirāḍ with</li>
