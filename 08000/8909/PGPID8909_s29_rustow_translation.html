<li>I(n your name)</li>
<li>I previously sent letters to my lord, the most glorious</li>
<li>elder &mdash; may God prolong his existence in health and make eternal</li>
<li>his support, happiness, wellbeing, benefaction,</li>
<li>high rank, strength and splendor and vanquish with humiliation</li>
<li>and ignominy those who envy him and his enemies,&nbsp;and never deprive him</li>
<li>of the good of success &mdash; in which I explained to you all</li>
<li>the matters and circumstances. I won't expand on it except to say</li>
<li>that I long for you, may God bring our reunion near&nbsp;</li>
<li>in the most preferable circumstances and the greatest expectations in his benefaction</li>
<li>and abundance of kindness, since He is responsible for this and has the power to bring it about,&nbsp;</li>
<li>if God wills in his mercy. I also informed you&nbsp;</li>
<li>in them of all the prices of the goods that</li>
<li>I need to send back to you. But I would like, if&nbsp;</li>
<li>this is stuitable to you, for frankincense and brazilwood to be sent immediately after</li>
<li>the holiday, if the good brazilwood goes for 120 dinars</li>
<li>per bale and the frankincense for 20 dinars</li>
<li>per qinṭār and 20 raṭls. If you don't have anything</li>
<li>with you and frankincense is available, get a loan from</li>

<li>the dīwān</li>
<li>and buy some,</li>
<li>as well as a bit of camphor</li>
<li>for 20 dinars per mann. But&nbsp;</li>
<li>prices are in the hands of God the exalted.</li>
<li>As for the rest, when&nbsp;</li>
<li>whatever there was that was unloaded</li>
<li>from the boat of the Dībājī,</li>
<li>some of the items came to ʿAydhāb,</li>
<li>and some remained in Suwākin.</li>
<li>They ran out of time&nbsp;</li>
<li>and Abū l-Karam the wakīl</li>
<li>took possession of the rest.</li>
<li>Each person's name</li>
<li>is on his qisṭ,</li>
<li>and Shemuʾel's name is</li>
<li>on all of them, and also&nbsp;</li>
<li>on his own qisṭ.</li>

<li>Some news arrived</li>
<li>that pepper, lac and brazilwood</li>
<li>arrived in ʿAydhāb.</li>
<li>The wakīl claimed them,</li>
<li>and they're with him and with the Muslims</li>
<li>who are going up to claim</li>
<li>their qisṭ. Nahrāy</li>
<li>is also going up.</li>

                        <ol>
<li>you to claim what belongs to Shemuʾel from the qisṭ. Don't</li>
<li>slack on this. Also, regarding Zikrī</li>
<li>al-Ṭarābulusī, the wakīl wanted legal documents</li>
<li>showing that you entered into an agreement about claiming his (goods). Do it,</li>
<li>&nbsp;and don't worry about it if all the merchants</li>
<li>know that the dirham in Shemuʾel's hands</li>
<li>belongs to you and you left Aden with it. I don't need</li>
<li>to urge you to help the elder Mufaḍḍal in bringing</li>
<li>this letter of mine to you and executing (the contents of) it with him. Whatever</li>
<li>accoutrements you request for the journey، you have</li>
<li>a right to claim them. Make the choice as well for</li>
<li>anyone whom you know he's taking care of. If you write letters to Aden,</li>
<li>let them know what he's capable of and the family he comes from. I'd' like his letters</li>
<li>to reach me letting me know of the kindness you've shown him.</li>
<li>Send best regards to all our colleagues who have left with the Kārim.</li>

<li>send them best regards.</li>
<li>Send Abū l-Ḥusayn and his two sisters</li>

<li>Send the entire family</li>
<li>best regards.</li>
<li>Send anyone over whom you extend your concern</li>
<li>best regards. Send Musallam</li>
<li>and Shemuʾel best</li>
<li>regards. Utmost peace.</li>
