<li>I(n your name)</li>
<li>I previously sent letters to my lord, the most glorious</li>
<li>elder &mdash; may God prolong his existence in health and make eternal</li>
<li>his support, happiness, wellbeing, benefaction,</li>
<li>high rank, strength and splendor and vanquish with humiliation</li>
<li>and ignominy those who envy him and his enemies,&nbsp;and never deprive him</li>
<li>of the good of success &mdash; in which I explained to you all</li>
<li>the matters and circumstances. I won't expand on it except to day</li>
<li>that I long for you, may God bring our reunion near&nbsp;</li>
<li>in the most preferable circumstances and the greatest expectations in his benefaction</li>
<li>and abundance of kindness, since he is responsible for this and has the power to bring it about,&nbsp;</li>
<li>if God wills in his mercy. I also informed you&nbsp;</li>
<li>in them of all the prices of the goods that</li>
<li>I need to send back to you. But I would like, if&nbsp;</li>
<li>this is stuitable to you, for frankincense and brazilwood to be sent immediately following*</li>
<li>the monsoon, if the good brazilwood goes for 120 dinars</li>
<li>per bale and the frankincense for 20 dinars</li>
<li>per qinṭār and 20 raṭls. If you don't have anything</li>
<li>with you and frankincense is available, enter into a qirāḍ with</li>

<li>the dīwān</li>
<li>and buy some,</li>
<li>as well as a bit of camphor</li>
<li>for 20 dinars per mann. But&nbsp;</li>
<li>prices are in the hands of God the exalted.</li>
<li>As for the rest, when&nbsp;</li>
<li>there was unloaded for them what was unloaded*</li>
<li>from the ship the Dībājī,</li>
<li>some the items came to ʿAydhāb,</li>
<li>and some remained in Suwākin.</li>
<li>They ran out of time&nbsp;</li>
<li>and Abū l-Karam the wakīl</li>
<li>passed over * the rest.</li>
<li>Each person's name</li>
<li>is on a line-item*</li>

<li>arrived in ʿAydhāb</li>
<li>and the wakīl claimed them</li>
<li>and they're with him and with the Muslims</li>
