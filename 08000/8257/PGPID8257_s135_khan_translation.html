<li>His slave Mubārak b. Ibrāhīm b.</li>
<li>Sabrā</li>
<li>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</li>
<li>The slave of the presence of my master, the most glorious elder, the sufficient Muʿtamid al-Dawla, may [God] prolong</li>
<li>his life and cause to endure his support, his eminence and his strength, and crush his enemies, is full</li>
<li>of prayers and praise for him in every gathering on account of what God, the exalted, has distinguished him with [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]</li>
<li>of external grace and pure disposition, esprit de corps, generosity and [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ].</li>
<li>His slave would lay down his life for him if he would honour him with what is available regarding [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]</li>
<li>and his duties, so that he may be under his authority, not with (a view to gaining) reward or gratitude,</li>
<li>but pride in his service. To him belongs the exalted opinion in this, if God wills.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone and [his] blessings [be upon our lord] Muḥammad, his prophet, and his family and [save them].</li>
<li>My sufficiency is God. [What an excellent keeper is he!]&nbsp;</li>
