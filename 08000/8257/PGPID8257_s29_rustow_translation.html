<li>His slave Mubārak b. Ibrāhīm b.</li>
<li>Sabrā</li>
<li>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.</li>
<li>The slave of the presence, my lord, the most glorious, sufficient elder Muʿtamid al-Dawla, may [God] prolo[ng]</li>
<li>his existence, make eternal his support, his loftiness and his power, and smite his enemies, is full</li>
<li>of prayers and praise for him in every assembly on account of what God, may he be exalted, has distinguished him with [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]</li>
<li>by way of manifest grace, pure character, solidarity, generosity and [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ].</li>
<li>His slave would offer his life for him if he were to honor him with an opportunity [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;]</li>
<li>and his provisions, so that he may fall under his orders without (seeking) recompense or [gratitude],</li>
<li>but out of pride in his service. To him belongs the exalted opinion in this matter, if God wills.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, and [his] prayers [be upon] our [lord] Muḥammad, his prophet, and his family, and [save them].&nbsp;</li>
