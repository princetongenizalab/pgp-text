His slave Mubārak b. Ibrāhīm b.
Sabrā
In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.
The slave of the presence, my lord, the most glorious, sufficient elder Muʿtamid al-Dawla, may [God] prolo[ng]
his existence, make eternal his support, his loftiness and his power, and smite his enemies, is full
of prayers and praise for him in every assembly on account of what God, may he be exalted, has distinguished him with [      ]
by way of manifest grace, pure character, solidarity, generosity and [       ].
His slave would offer his life for him if he were to honor him with an opportunity [        ]
and his duties, so that he may fall under his orders without (seeking) reward or [gratitude],
but out of pride in his service. To him belongs the exalted opinion in this matter, if God wills. 
Praise be to God alone, and [his] prayers [be upon] our [lord] Muḥammad, his prophet, and his family, and [save them].
