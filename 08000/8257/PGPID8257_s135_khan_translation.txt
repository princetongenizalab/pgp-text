His slave Mubārak b. Ibrāhīm b.
Sabrā
In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
The slave of the presence of my master, the most glorious elder, the sufficient Muʿtamid al-Dawla, may [God] prolong
his life and cause to endure his support, his eminence and his strength, and crush his enemies, is full
of prayers and praise for him in every gathering on account of what God, the exalted, has distinguished him with [      ]
of external grace and pure disposition, esprit de corps, generosity and [       ].
His slave would lay down his life for him if he would honour him with what is available regarding [        ]
and his duties, so that he may be under his authority, not with (a view to gaining) reward or gratitude,
but pride in his service. To him belongs the exalted opinion in this, if God wills. 
Praise be to God alone and [his] blessings [be upon our lord] Muḥammad, his prophet, and his family and [save them].
My sufficiency is God. [What an excellent keeper is he!]
