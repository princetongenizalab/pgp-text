Recto


In y(our name, Oh) Merc(iful).     From Umm Da'u'd, your paternal aunt.


You are the fairest of the sons of man.


Blessed is the man who ( trusts in the Lord).


Blessed shall you be when you come in.


To his excellency, my lord, the great and illustrious physician,


the elder Abu Zikri, may God lengthen his life and not


deprive him of the best of fortune; may God bring us together soon -


not after a long while - God on high willing. I should like to inform


my lord, the elder Abu Zikri, that we


had a great joy in your absence. For, by the grace of the God


of Israel, there came to your servant Sitt al-Yumn a great joy in the presence of


our lord the Nasi'. It was a beautiful wedding


on a beautiful dai's. We had on top of it, our lord the Nasi'


and our lord the judge, and our lord R. Samuel and the bridegroom


Hibat Alla'h son of the teacher Futu'h' Ibn al- Amma'ni'.


May God vindicate you by your daughter, Amen. Now, our master,


we ask that you - being so gracious - speak to the elder Abu


'l-Karam Ibn al-Siqilli' about the matter of the eighteen dirhems.


Greet for me your father, R. Elijah.


The world is no good when you are absent. May your welfare increase and not diminish.


Verso


Now, my elder Abu Zikri, ask the advice of your mother together with


the daughter of Khuraym and say (to them), have a new basket made


and put the porcelain bowls in it. Then say again,


what happened to the turban. Here is a turban


waiting. It is already superfluous. By your life,


I haven't deemed the much excessive in order that we would deem the little


excessive.


Address


May (this letter) arrive at Cairo the guarded, and handed to the son of R.


Elljah, the elder Abu Zikri. And peace.
