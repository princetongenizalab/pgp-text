                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In y(our name, Oh) Merc(iful).     From Umm Da'u'd, your paternal aunt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the fairest of the sons of man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blessed is the man who ( trusts in the Lord).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blessed shall you be when you come in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To his excellency, my lord, the great and illustrious physician,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the elder Abu Zikri, may God lengthen his life and not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deprive him of the best of fortune; may God bring us together soon -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not after a long while - God on high willing. I should like to inform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord, the elder Abu Zikri, that we</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had a great joy in your absence. For, by the grace of the God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of Israel, there came to your servant Sitt al-Yumn a great joy in the presence of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our lord the Nasi'. It was a beautiful wedding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on a beautiful dai's. We had on top of it, our lord the Nasi'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and our lord the judge, and our lord R. Samuel and the bridegroom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hibat Alla'h son of the teacher Futu'h' Ibn al- Amma'ni'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God vindicate you by your daughter, Amen. Now, our master,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we ask that you - being so gracious - speak to the elder Abu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'l-Karam Ibn al-Siqilli' about the matter of the eighteen dirhems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greet for me your father, R. Elijah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world is no good when you are absent. May your welfare increase and not diminish.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now, my elder Abu Zikri, ask the advice of your mother together with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the daughter of Khuraym and say (to them), have a new basket made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and put the porcelain bowls in it. Then say again,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what happened to the turban. Here is a turban</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>waiting. It is already superfluous. By your life,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven't deemed the much excessive in order that we would deem the little</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excessive.</p>
</li>

                        <ol>
<li>
<p>May (this letter) arrive at Cairo the guarded, and handed to the son of R.</p>
</li>

<p>Elljah, the elder Abu Zikri. And peace.</p>
