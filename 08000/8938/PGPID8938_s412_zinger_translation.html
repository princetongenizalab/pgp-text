<li>
<p>In (Your) name, O Merci(ful)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letter of my lord has arrived, may God prolong your life and make lasting your honor,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strength, health, and favor. I understood (your letter). Regarding what you mentioned&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the matter of Ephraim: I sent for him and he came to me. I showed him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the letter of my lord, may God guard you. I saw that he desires&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his wife and the reason for his neglecting her is only because she left&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>him and went up to Fustat against his command. (This was) after&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she and he sought judgment in al-Maḥalla from Mr.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joseph [ha-ḥave]r, may the R(ock) pr(eserve him). It became affirmed to him (i.e. to Joseph) that she transgressed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[....] When she saw that the ruling would be against her, she went up&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Fustat against his (i.e. her husband's) command. Also, he did not have [...].&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is a poor man. He is not able&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to reside in Fustat. If she comes to him, he will have nothing&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dearer than her. If she does not desire to live in the Delta (rīf), he will put her up&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[in] Damietta. If she desires him, she should tell him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to send her a messenger who would bring her to him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>according to where she chooses that he put her up. For he cannot&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leave the t[ow]n [becau]se of the government's tax collector and cannot leave. If she chooses him (also possible: it) he will have nothing dearer than her. If she does not want him (also possible: it), let her inform him so he will send her bill of divorce to her. This will be her choice and not his. I send you the utmost greetings of peace.</p>
