In (Your) name, O Merci(ful)


The letter of my lord has arrived, may God prolong your life and make lasting your honor, 


strength, health, and favor. I understood (your letter). Regarding what you mentioned 


in the matter of Ephraim: I sent for him and he came to me. I showed him 


the letter of my lord, may God guard you. I saw that he desires 


his wife and the reason for his neglecting her is only because she left 


him and went up to Fustat against his command. (This was) after 


she and he sought judgment in al-Maḥalla from Mr. 


Joseph [ha-ḥave]r, may the R(ock) pr(eserve him). It became affirmed to him (i.e. to Joseph) that she transgressed 


[....] When she saw that the ruling would be against her, she went up 


to Fustat against his (i.e. her husband's) command. Also, he did not have [...]. 


He is a poor man. He is not able 


to reside in Fustat. If she comes to him, he will have nothing 


dearer than her. If she does not desire to live in the Delta (rīf), he will put her up 


[in] Damietta. If she desires him, she should tell him 


to send her a messenger who would bring her to him 


according to where she chooses that he put her up. For he cannot 


leave the t[ow]n [becau]se of the government's tax collector and cannot leave. If she chooses him (also possible: it) he will have nothing dearer than her. If she does not want him (also possible: it), let her inform him so he will send her bill of divorce to her. This will be her choice and not his. I send you the utmost greetings of peace.
