and (pledged) to his servant, the glorious lord, commander of the armies, sword of  Islam, defender of mankind, protector of the judges of the Muslims, guide of the dāʿīs  
of the believers, may God strengthen the religion through him and give comfort  to the commander of the faithful by his long life, and (pledged) to his servant Ḥātim ibn Faraj, under the supervision of the elder 'Abū 'Isḥāq

for a sum of money amounting to eight dīnārs in minted coin, full weight, paying  an instalment every month without delay, withholding,  
protesting with an argument or giving a pretext in any way whatsoever,  managing his money beneficientIy
