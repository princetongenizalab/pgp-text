In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


The slaves report the death of Ḥusn, the Jewess, an adult woman, the daughter of Mūsā,


the Jew. She left by way of heirs having a right to her inheritance three male children,


these being Futūḥ, Ibrāhīm, and Makīn. This was on Thursday, the twenty-third


of Rabīʿ II, in the year six-hundred and fifty-five. When


they recognized the validity of this they attached their signatures on the aforementioned date. Praise be to God,


the eternal.
