                        <p>May He keep your boys, the esteemed notables, the brilliant youth, and may you be granted to see their joy and wedding. Amen, may it be ordained thus. When I parted from your excellency, I intended to sail to the island of Cyprus, but a strong storm diverted the boat to Tarsus. I was very much afraid that the king would take hold of me and detain me. Therefore the boys who traveled with me went up to Fahd b. Karīm ("Cheetah panther, son of Noble-minded"), and informed him of my arrival. Fahd came on board and said to me: "Disembark, do not be afraid, the king has granted you safety." He carried with him letters of safe-conduct from the king assuring me that I was permitted to return to my place, and I found with him safeguards the like of which no one has received before. The ministers were very happy with me and thought that I would remain. They made me all kinds of offers ensured by guarantees. I said to them: "Until the first of the next month." I offered a sum of money to the Christians in the town; Fahdān is an in-law of theirs. But the illness of which you know remained with me and I could not stay any longer [for I needed] treatment.</p>

                        <p>I found my paternal uncle present in Alexandria and he brought me to the physician who let me take medicine three times. I found healing through it, God lit up my eyes in his bounty and goodness. I am very much indebted to the illustrious elder, the physician Abū I-Karam Ibn al-Wāsiṭī, the son of your paternal uncle, may God let many people be like the two of you.</p>
