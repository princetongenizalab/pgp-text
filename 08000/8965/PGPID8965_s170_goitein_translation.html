                        <p>May He keep your boys, the esteemed notables, the brilliant youth, and may you be granted to see their joy and wedding. Amen, may it be ordained thus. When I parted from your excellency, I intended to sail to the island of Cyprus, but a strong storm diverted the boat to Tarsus. I was very much afraid that the king would take hold of me and detain me. Therefore the boys who traveled with me went up to Fahd b. Karīm ("Cheetah panther, son of Noble-minded"), and informed him of my arrival. Fahd came on board and said to me: "Disembark, do not be afraid, the king has granted you safety." He carried with him letters of safe-conduct from the king assuring me that I was permitted to return to my place, and I found with him safeguards the like of which no one has received before. The ministers were very happy with me and thought that I would remain. They made me all kinds of offers ensured by guarantees. I said to them: "Until the first of the next month." I offered a sum of money to the Christians in the town; Fahdān is an in-law of theirs. But the illness of which you know remained with me and I could not stay any longer [for I needed] treatment.</p>

                        <p>I found my paternal uncle present in Alexandria and he brought me to the physician who let me take medicine three times. I found healing through it, God lit up my eyes in his bounty and goodness. I am very much indebted to the illustrious elder, the physician Abū I-Karam Ibn al-Wāsiṭī, the son of your paternal uncle, may God let many people be like the two of you.</p>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <p>and the elder Abū l-Manṣūr ("Victorious"), ... and the physician ʿAbd al-Kāfī ("Servant of the All-sufficient"), ... the physician ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ("Servant of the All-merciful"), may our God remember them by bestowing on them blessings, life, bounty, and peace, and may thus be his will. The bearer of this letter, the illustrious elder R. Yiṣḥaq, the son of R. Avraham, is one of the illustrious men of Sicily (or Palermo); many here in Alexandria know him as a prominent and fine person and a scion of great families. His arrival in Alexandria coincided with the presence of a large company from France. Our community has made a large collection for them and has also taken care of their maintenance and expenses during their stay here, so that there is no possibility to provide for this or any other man at present. Your bounty is now besought that you may act for this man</p>
                    
                        <h3>Verso - right margin</h3>
                    
                        <p>in accordance with your [noble] habits and your munificence, so that he will part from [you] full of thanks, as all people who pass your house. To all of you kindest regards, greetings, and respects. And peace. I need not impress on you the urgency of action for that man, so that he should be treated well and kindly, for he is suffering utmost deprivation. Any good done for him-he is worth. And peace.</p>
