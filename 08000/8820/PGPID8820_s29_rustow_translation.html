                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>&hellip; Dhukhr al-Mulk Kawkab al-Dawla wa-Sadīduhā Abū Manṣūr Bakhtiyār the commander (?), may God make his support eternal,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your correspondence regarding eliminating the obstruction of his sugar, which is at the refinery&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Jawjar. You are deputized over those who have a duty to pay kharāj (tax) to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on it (the sugarcane), and you are entrusted with the kharāj that they owe on the refining of sugarcane and taro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the like, until they pay it (in full). We are issuing an order to you with regard to all this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(commanding) what must be done about it. We will report to him (the amīr), and we will be reinstated in his gratitude for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the sugarcane, you must allow the men of my lord</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the aforementioned lofty official (amīr muntakhab, referring to Dhukhr al-Mulk?), may God make his support eternal, to collect it and dispose of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as he (the amīr) sees fit; therefore, do not allow the landholders (holders of an iqṭāʿ) to prevent this (your collecting the sugar)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in any way, for any reason. Report to us about what produce is owed to them (the muqṭāʿīn/landholders) so that we can decide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>together with him (the amīr) concerning the offsetting (i.e., tax deduction) of their produce/income from it. As for what he (the amīr) is owed of the remainder of what is taxable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>due to extraction (of tax) from the inhabitants of Jawjar, it was decided with the amīr to write a document for Muslim, our ghulām,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delegating authority (to the ghulām) over those to whom the remaining sum adheres (i.e., who owe it), so that they pay it to him and deduct</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its income (i.e., what the muqṭāʿ is owed) from it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As for the kharāj contract that is owed on pressing cane,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taro and the like, you must meet with the bureaucrat/official of the district about the contract of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this kharāj and report on it to us (on what it says and what its wording is), so that I can come to an agreement with him regarding its execution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know this, may God be your support, and execute it according to what is required, and report to us on what is happening near you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regarding it, if God wills. Written on the second day of Jumāda II.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone. May God pray for our lord Muḥammad, for his messenger, and for his ancestors, the pure imāms,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and save them.&nbsp; &nbsp; God is sufficient for us; what an excellent keeper is he.</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Our lord the amīr Surūr al-Malikī entrusted/ordered our ghulām to go forth and order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the aforementioned (muqṭaʿīn) to undertake (to pay) this remainder, and to forward on (to the amīr) the kharāj due on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore he empowered him in this matter and supported him in discharging the situation expeditiously. </p>
</li>
