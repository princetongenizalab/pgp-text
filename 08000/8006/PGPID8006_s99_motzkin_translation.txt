       His son Solomon b. Elijah, (may) G(od) b(e) h(is helper).


      It happened that on Monday, the twenty-fifth -


God is my light and my salvation, etc. - of the month of Tammu'z, one thousand five hundred and thirty.


I inform my paternal aunt Umm Da'u'd, may her honored position last, that I long for her ....


longing, and am grieved on account of my being far from her. I am in perfect health


and well-being. I lack nought save gazing upon you. May God bring us together in goodness


and well-being in His grace, God most high be willing. There is no doubt that I am determined - God most high


be willing - to come (visit) you to be filled with your pleasant countenance and to take the lucky


daughter, so dear to me, namely Sitt al-Yumn, may God grant her the success (He grants to those)


who know (Him), and may He bring us together as He wishes in His grace and mercy. We ask


you, my aunt, not to detain her and not waver (in doing what is) right by her, for


when I should come down I will stay only ten days, because I have some young boys with me whom I teach. I


am in a fine (financial) condition, thanks be to God for His graciousness, and … . We therefore thank Him


forever. We ask you, in your highmindedness, to refrain from detaining her;


if I find any impediment, I will let her go. Send (a letter) about her and let me know


how you are and what kind of dower you want - I'll send it to you right away.


The minute you read these words send me quickly (a letter and speak in great detail about it


and about everything you want. I am well, praise be to God on high. And [peace.
