                        <ol><li>Testimony which took place before us—we, the undersigned witnesses—on the … day of the week,</li><li>     days into the month of Shevaṭ of the year one thousand and four hundred and four years, according to the count to [which] we are accustomed,</li><li>in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. Thus: (his) hon(or, our) tea(cher) and (our) master Yaḥya b. Samuel ha-Kohen </li><li>and (his) hon(or, our) tea(cher) and m(aster) ‘Ulla ha-Levi b. Joseph (may his) e(nd be) g(ood) came before us, and they said to us: “There was a pre-existing partnership (shirka) between us, and we separated</li><li>from it, and each of us received his due in total. Each of us released his fellow in a complete and total release, </li><li>orally and with in (his) heart, in this world and in the world to come, from all types of oaths, even rider oaths. After that, we renewed</li><li>a partnership (shirka) between the two of us after separating from the initial partnership (shirka). I, Yaḥyā ha-Kohen, brought out from my own assets, five hundred gold dinars,</li><li>of specie, good of weight, and (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) ‘Ulla b. Joseph (may his) e(nd be) g(ood) brought out from his assets two hundred and fifty //dinars,//</li><li>the total of our capital amounting to seven hundred and fifty dinars, and the amount which we have in al-Shām with Bishāra, and with </li><li>Abū ‘Imrān ha-Kohen, they will … in the money-changing stand. Now, testify on our behalf and perform a qinyan with us, effective immediately, with all the appropriate legal formulae …</li><li>and all the expressions of certainty and all the language of claims, and write two appropriate documents and give one copy to each of us </li><li>in order that he would have a title of right and proof, in accordance with our will and desire. We testify before you w[ithout]</li><li>[dur]ess or compulsion but rather with a full heart, acknowledging before you that we have separated […] which […]</li><li>[from the beginning of] time until now, and each of us has released his fellow in a complete and total release, since … […]</li><li>[…] and nothing remains for either of us with [his fellow …]</li></ol>
