<p>[Blessings etc. ?] from Him who dwells</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the heavenly expanse.  To [my son?] my beloved only son Mar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fudhail, from me, your mother Archondou, and from my husband</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mar Elia. Receive many greetings.  You know, son,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we are alive and we trust by God's mercy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you are also well (?). As you know, son,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... has gone to her eternal home (may there be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>life and peace to you and your household and to all Israel). I have heard,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>son, that you have hurt your eyes, and by the faith</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of Heaven from the day I heard that my eye has flowed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and I have wept night and day and without cease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You wrote to me that you have bought a ?mattress (τυλάριν): now if</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you listen to my advice, son, sell it and keep</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the money. Take care of yourself, son: if God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helps you and has mercy on you, concern yourself with the success of your ?business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and may the Holy One, Blessed be He, have mercy on you and ..., because God knows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the things they are saying about you, that no ear should</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hear. And why should you, son, want to buy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a... or a ?mattress (τυλάριν) or anything else? And everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curses you and says, Cursed be he, Cursed be his name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if he meets from this day on with that wife of his.  Know,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>son, that every day Ma'foudh the son of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mar ?Idias comes and nags me about the quarter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dīnār that you borrowed from him</p>

<p>And if [God?] helps you ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>buy me 3 ... of good ... and I</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will repay you the money. And know, son, that I have bought</p>

<li>
<p>you ... and half a rotel of almonds,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but I could not find a reliable person to send them to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many greetings to you, my son, from me, your mother,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... and from ?my sister D... [And I desired?],</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>son, to go up to Fusṭāt, but when I got as far as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buhaira there was such a strong wind that I could not find</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a boat prepared (to sail). And ... and my eyes hurt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>very badly and I give 3 <i>zuz</i> every week</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the doctor, and I cannot move from this place. If</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God is good to you do me a favour and come quickly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to fetch me out of here so that I do not die, and may your prosperity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase and not decrease. Amen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask for my son Mar Fudhail in Fusṭāt. From me</p>

<li>
<p>your mother Archondou in Alexandria.</p>
