<li>Those who wrote their signatures at the bottom of this document, from among the witnesses whose signature</li>
<li>has been confirmed, said that they (the witnesses) were present on the eve</li>
<li>of Pesaḥ of the year 1351 (of the Era) of Documents in Cairo the</li>
<li>[divinely-]protected, in the home of Suleymān b. Isḥāq b. Meir, and</li>
<li>a partnership (mufāwaḍa) proceed[ed] between them and this Suleymān, in the matter of [&hellip;]</li>
<li>with Khalaf b. Ibrāhīm the Ḥazzan and Suleymān rejected (their claim) ...[&hellip;]</li>
<li>saying to all those whom he addressed, &ldquo;You have already settled</li>
<li>with your Ḥazzan&mdash;that is, this Khalaf&mdash;and he has enriched you</li>
<li>and bestowed honor upon you as he wished; thus there remains with me no [further] claim for him accompanied by a</li>
<li>qinyan between me and him in the past that he would not do</li>
<li>anything without my command, but now he is free from it (my command).&rdquo; We wrote testify[ing]</li>
<li>to what happened as proof for the aforementioned Khalaf, in order that he would promise [us]</li>
<li>freeing him from the qinyan in which he had been obligated to this Suleymān.</li>
<li>This was on Monday, the last day of Tishri (in) the year 1[351]</li>
<li>(of the Era) of Documents in the city of Cairo near</li>
<li>Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River.</li>
<li>Tobias b. Japheth ha-Levi Witness.</li>
<li>Salāma ha-Kohen b. Nisan said, &ldquo;I remember Suleymān making the</li>
<li>statement (appearing) in this document in another place, the residence of the Elder A[&hellip;]</li>
<li>Naḥum bar Ḥayim Witness. There came before us in the permanent cour[t]</li>
<li>in Fusṭāṭ, three (judges speaking) as one, all the witnesses who signed</li>
<li>this document, two witnesses, who are &lsquo;Allūn b. Faraj and Tobias b. Japheth ha-Levi the witnesses</li>
<li>and they showed us [their signatur]es on this document, thus we affirmed</li>

<li>&nbsp;&lsquo;Allūn b. Faraj said, &ldquo;Indeed, I know that what was between Khalaf the Ḥazzan and Suleymān</li>
<li>b. Isaac was a joint enterprise (mu&lsquo;āmala) and not a qinyan from the eve of Passover 1351.&rdquo;</li>
