<li>
<p>intend to send my candy and exhibit it in Cairo. As to what you told me, to send</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what belongs to you, the one who will collect from me the price of the sugar will collect for the candy which</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is yours - after I will divide it. This (is all) I (have to) tell you (about this matter). I expect a letter from you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>soon about what to buy for the income from the sugar so that you will be satisfied, -</p>

<p>&lt;although&gt; I have sworn not to sell to anyone anything nor to buy or sell for anyone. This (is all) I (have to) tell you (about this matter).</p>

<p>At the service of the dignity of my lord and master the gracious and august elder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu'l-Faraj the Judge, may God lengthen your life and perpetuate your honored position</p>

<p>and preserve you; may He bring us together in sound condition and well-being.</p>

<p>My service] to my master, what happened to you .....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a little in all my affairs. By God, I have not been able (to sell)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even for a dirhem. Candy is worth nothing. By God, I have in my possession some (candy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(which I bought) for about ninety di’na’rs; it's hardly worth ten matha’-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>qi’l (today). Also, by God, we have suffered a loss of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>six Egyptian di’na’rs on the sugar, after I gave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>five months credit on it. My lord and father knows about the matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ibra’hi’m b. Ha’ru’n knows the matter too; also b. Ha’mu’n IbrahIm left me with only five matha’qI’l, and the five which he has (invested) in the candy</p>

<p>if I had in the house</p>
