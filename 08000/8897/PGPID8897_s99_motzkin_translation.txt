time of the sugar........... This (is all) I (have to) tell you (about this matter). I


intend to send my candy and exhibit it in Cairo. As to what you told me, to send


what belongs to you, the one who will collect from me the price of the sugar will collect for the candy which


is yours - after I will divide it. This (is all) I (have to) tell you (about this matter). I expect a letter from you


soon about what to buy for the income from the sugar so that you will be satisfied, -


<although> I have sworn not to sell to anyone anything nor to buy or sell for anyone. This (is all) I (have to) tell you (about this matter).


The pearl-perforator has .....' s pearl. They will, God willing, arrive


for the holiday. May your peace increase forever.

At the service of the dignity of my lord and master the gracious and august elder


Abu'l-Faraj the Judge, may God lengthen your life and perpetuate your honored position


and preserve you; may He bring us together in sound condition and well-being.


My service] to my master, what happened to you .....


a little in all my affairs. By God, I have not been able (to sell)


even for a dirhem. Candy is worth nothing. By God, I have in my possession some (candy)


(which I bought) for about ninety di’na’rs; it's hardly worth ten matha’-


qi’l (today). Also, by God, we have suffered a loss of


six Egyptian di’na’rs on the sugar, after I gave


five months credit on it. My lord and father knows about the matter.


Ibra’hi’m b. Ha’ru’n knows the matter too; also b. Ha’mu’n IbrahIm left me with only five matha’qI’l, and the five which he has (invested) in the candy

is not worth a quarter.


And now, by God,


if I had in the house


one dirhem I would grant you a loan,


my master. However,


I have sold


the sugar alone


and lost half a dinar
