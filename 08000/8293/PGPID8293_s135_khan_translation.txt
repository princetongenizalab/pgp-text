In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. Praise be to God, with the  praise of those who give thanks.  


When the order of our master, the Ṭawāshi (eunuch), the great commander Bahāʾ al-Din Qarāqūsh, the servant of al-Manṣūr and  


of al-Afḍal, came in a gracious rescript crowned by his well-known signature, by the hand of the amir Fāris al-Dawla  


ʿAdī, one of his retinue and his special commissioner, containing (instructions) to  fetch the gold deposited in the possession of the wife of  


Ghanim ibn ʿĪsā, one of the inhabitants of Upper Manūf, the commissioner arrived  on the second  


of Rabiʿ II of the year five-hundred and ninety-five and the witnesses accredited  in the aforementioned district who attached their signatures below came  


and crossed to the house of the aforementioned Ghanim. His wife opened  


the wall and brought out from it gold coins, numbering one hundred and seventy dīnārs.  


Their weight was determined, this being one hundred and sixty-one, a half and a  quarter dinars.  


They were placed in a purse, put under wax seal and handed over to the  aforementioned Fāris aI-Dawla ʿAdi  


for him to deliver to his honour Bahāʾ' al-Din, if God, exalted is he, wills, and  [ ]  


above it. Praise be to God alone. Whoever trusts in God, he (God) is his sufficiency.
