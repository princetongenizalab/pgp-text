of al-Afḍal, came in a gracious rescript crowned by his well-known signature, by the hand of the amir Fāris al-Dawla  


ʿAdī, one of his retinue and his special commissioner, containing (instructions) to  fetch the gold deposited in the possession of the wife of  


Ghanim ibn ʿĪsā, one of the inhabitants of Upper Manūf, the commissioner arrived  on the second

Their weight was determined, this being one hundred and sixty-one, a half and a  quarter dinars.  


They were placed in a purse, put under wax seal and handed over to the  aforementioned Fāris aI-Dawla ʿAdi  


for him to deliver to his honour Bahāʾ' al-Din, if God, exalted is he, wills, and  [ ]  


above it. Praise be to God alone. Whoever trusts in God, he (God) is his sufficiency.
