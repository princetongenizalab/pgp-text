Recto


I (would like to) inform the august,


exalted and gracious presence of our master


and teacher Elijah the enlightened,


wise and understanding judge - (may his) R(ock) p(reserve him). - Now, then.


Your maid-servant, the wife of the al-Sadi'd


departed from you grateful


for your graciousness and kindness. I am still


without news from you


about the boy. I wish you would inform me


how he is and what he is doing.


I only refrained from coming out of fear


that the boy be seized on account of the poll-tax,


and I would be punished for him. You know the heart


of a mother, and that I cannot enjoy life


because of being separated from him. I ask


your grace that you send me some of the money


which is kept by you. For I am in terrible straits


on account of the depression and I have nothing at all. The children


need something of this (money), while we have nothing


except God and you. Don't force me


to come (to Cairo). Take heed! Take heed!
