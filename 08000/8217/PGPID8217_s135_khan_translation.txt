Recto

In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  
What does our lord, the jurisconsult, may God grant him prosperity, say 
regarding the following. A person drank medicine and immediately collapsed 
in his house. He manifested an ailment that obliged him to leave 
his house to relieve himself. A person then frightened him  
concerning the medicine that he had drunk, without there being any 
reason for his fear, and the person feared some  
chronic illness on account of the fright that  
he had suffered through the person who had frightened him for no 
reason. (This is what happened), although there was no witness, 
save God, exalted is he. Grant us your opinion, may God have mercy upon you. Praise be to God  
and the blessings of God be upon our lord Muḥammad
