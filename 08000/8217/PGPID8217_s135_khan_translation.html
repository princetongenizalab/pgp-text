                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>What does our lord, the jurisconsult, may God grant him prosperity, say&nbsp;</li>
<li>regarding the following. A person drank medicine and immediately collapsed&nbsp;</li>
<li>in his house. He manifested an ailment that obliged him to leave&nbsp;</li>
<li>his house to relieve himself. A person then frightened him&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>concerning the medicine that he had drunk, without there being any&nbsp;</li>
<li>reason for his fear, and the person feared some&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>chronic illness on account of the fright that&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>he had suffered through the person who had frightened him for no&nbsp;</li>
<li>reason. (This is what happened), although there was no witness,&nbsp;</li>
<li>save God, exalted is he. Grant us your opinion, may God have mercy upon you. Praise be to God&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>and the blessings of God be upon our lord Muá¸¥ammad&nbsp;</li>
