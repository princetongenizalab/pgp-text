This is what Efrayim ibn ʿEli, the Jew, leased from Abū al-Futūḥ Ghālib ibn Fahd,  the clerk in charge of the government foundations and aḥkār administered in the  office of prosperous Friday and neighbourhood mosques in Fusṭāṭ, under the  supervision of the elder [Bū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad ibn]  


Muḥammad ibn ʿUbaydallāh al-Qāʾifī, the certified witness, the supervisor of what  is administered in this office. He leased from him, with one clapping of the hands and one contract, all the plot of land, the government quarter, the mound, bare to the sky, which is on the island of Fusṭāṭ - Miṣr, on the bank of the Nile between  the aforementioned island  


and the Jīza of Fusṭāṭ - Miṣr, It is surrounded and enclosed by four boundaries.  The southern one extends to the cemetery and the plot rented by the rayyis Bū al-Tāḥir ibn al-Bayān. The northern extends to the plot rented by 'Adwa ibnat  'Askar and the small house of Ibn ʿAbd aI-Ḥākim and one of

The eastern  extends to the road that divides it from various places and. that leads to mosques  that are situated there, the house of the rayyis Bū ʿAlī ibn al-Bayān, the plot rented by the tanner, the tannery that is situated there,  


the aforementioned two small houses of the sponge seller <and other> places and  roads. The western one extends to the bank of the Nile near the land of the  jīza of Fusṭāṭ- Miṣr. Its being granted as a ḥikr was minuted on the back of the  petition concerning it (sent by) this lessee named herein to the Judge and certified witness [ ] Abū al-Ḥasan Muḥammad ibn Hibatallāh ibn al-Ḥasan,  


the head of the office of prosperous Friday and neighbourhood mosques in al-Muʿizziyya - Cairo, the guarded, and in Fusṭāṭ, of the mawārīth al-ḥashriyya  and  of the auspicious granaries, may God make eternal the rule of the one who rules  them. Its (the petition's) content, omitting the initial blessing, has the following form:  


His slave reports [to that on the island of Fusṭāṭ] - Miṣr, there is a  plot of land, a mound, [ without buildings], bare to the sky, on the bank of the  Nile near Gīza that he desires to lease, paying whatever ground rent by fixed  instalments and optional deposit in advance as is customary in  


such cases. [ ] It was endorsed on its verso [Let] the  office [look] into that, if God wills. Then the following statement was written:  The case was referred to the office of mosques [ ] and it was indicated  that  


it was the custom to [let as ḥikr the lands] and plots of ground that.  [ ] .in the lands of the jazīra of Fusṭāṭ- Miṣr, and they constitute  assets of this aforementioned office and are within the purview of my master, the  Judge [ ]  


 if God wills. It was written in the first ten days of Ṣafar, of the year five-hundred  and nine. He, in turn, made an endorsement addressed to the aforementioned  office, the text of which is as follows: My master, the elder, Bū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn  Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿUbaydallāh al-Qā​​ʾifī, supervisor of the government  quarters administered in the office of mosques [ ]  


let him take cognizance of what the petition on its recto contains and what is  stated by the office on its verso. Let him examine the land for which the lease  has been requested and (establish) whether it is administered in this office,  whether it is land that is permitted to be let publically as a ḥikr, whether the rent  of its property and objects of value has been fixed ... [ ]  


with a specific rent, then request from the office verification as to what the customary procedure is in such matters and apprise me of this so that I may  execute it, God willing.

 may God prolong his life, cause to endure his support, his brilliance, his success and his wide influence and crush his enemies - instructed in his minute above and  I have taken cognizance of what is at the top of the recto and on the verso of  this document. I inspected the area that is alluded to in it and I found that it was  bare, without buildings on it,  


and that it was permissible to grant it as a ḥikr. I measured it and its  measurement was, from the south side to the north side, thirty cubits and, from  the east side to the west side, forty cubits, with sides equal in length, according to  the (length of) cubit that is in current use. Two dirhams a month have been fixed  by way of ground rent for the applicant

In what has been fixed by way of ground rent  and will be paid in advance  


 .. ... [ ] ....... [ ] ...... [ ] in the year five-hundred and nine.  Then after this the head of the aforementioned office added a minute instructing  that it be registered in the office, that the documents of lease be written and that  one of these be archived  


for the office [ ] . [ ] .. this lessee undertaking this ḥikr mentioned herein in these terms, for a period of ten [complete,  consecutive years],  


starting the beginning of Ṣafar of the year five-hundred and nine and finishing  the end Muḥarram of the year five-hundred and nineteen, for  [ which] constitute currency in Fusṭāṭ- Miṣr, in its celebrated land,  reckoning at twenty-four dirhams a year [ ]  


[and] this lessee undertaking a ḥikr has made an optional deposit in advance to  the office for the ḥikr mentioned herein of five dīnārs and [ ] . the order of payment from the office fully ratified by signatures, as is the custom in  such cases. [ ] handed over [everything]  


that this ḥikr lease mentioned herein entailed and this lessee undertaking the ḥikr received it from him in the customary way and it passed into his possession,  his hold and his tenancy. His right to use it came into force and also his right to  the freedom of action that is customarily granted to those undertaking a ḥikr in  connection with their ḥikr, without anyone obstructing


or preventing, and his right to build upon it buildings of any kind he chooses, to plant any type of plantation he wishes and to dig a well, if he wishes. He will be free, regarding any of these undertakings, to lease, receive rent, sell and receive a  price after the office has received  


what is owed to it in dues, at the times that they fall due, without delay,  withholding or protesting unfeasibility of cultivation, inability to deal with it,  impracticability, excess cost of building or anything else whatsoever.  


These terms will hold throughout the period of this lease until its end. When it ends the status of what he builds is that of buildings owned on ḥikr land. This was after they had acknowledged seeing what this lease entailed and recognizing  


it. They mutually contracted that [ and] separated physically after it was  completed and came into force, mutually satisfied with it and executing its  provisions. Should any claim be made against this lessee undertaking the ḥikr with respect to what this lease contained
