                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate, his blessings and peace be&nbsp; upon our lord Muḥammad, his prophet and his&nbsp; family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is what Efrayim ibn ʿEli, the Jew, leased from Abū al-Futūḥ Ghālib ibn Fahd,&nbsp; the clerk in charge of the government foundations and aḥkār administered in the&nbsp; office of prosperous Friday and neighbourhood mosques in Fusṭāṭ, under the&nbsp; supervision of the elder [Bū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn Aḥmad ibn]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muḥammad ibn ʿUbaydallāh al-Qāʾifī, the certified witness, the supervisor of what&nbsp; is administered in this office. He leased from him, with one clapping of the hands and one contract, all the plot of land, the government quarter, the mound, bare to the sky, which is on the island of Fusṭāṭ - Miṣr, on the bank of the Nile between&nbsp; the aforementioned island&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the Jīza of Fusṭāṭ - Miṣr, It is surrounded and enclosed by four boundaries.&nbsp; The southern one extends to the cemetery and the plot rented by the rayyis Bū al-Tāḥir ibn al-Bayān. The northern extends to the plot rented by 'Adwa ibnat&nbsp; 'Askar and the small house of Ibn ʿAbd aI-Ḥākim and one of&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>

The eastern&nbsp; extends to the road that divides it from various places and. that leads to mosques&nbsp; that are situated there, the house of the rayyis Bū ʿAlī ibn al-Bayān, the plot rented by the tanner, the tannery that is situated there,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the aforementioned two small houses of the sponge seller &lt;and other&gt; places and&nbsp; roads. The western one extends to the bank of the Nile near the land of the&nbsp; jīza of Fusṭāṭ- Miṣr. Its being granted as a ḥikr was minuted on the back of the&nbsp; petition concerning it (sent by) this lessee named herein to the Judge and certified witness [ ] Abū al-Ḥasan Muḥammad ibn Hibatallāh ibn al-Ḥasan,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the head of the office of prosperous Friday and neighbourhood mosques in al-Muʿizziyya - Cairo, the guarded, and in Fusṭāṭ, of the mawārīth al-ḥashriyya &nbsp;and&nbsp; of the auspicious granaries, may God make eternal the rule of the one who rules&nbsp; them. Its (the petition's) content, omitting the initial blessing, has the following form:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His slave reports [to that on the island of Fusṭāṭ] - Miṣr, there is a&nbsp; plot of land, a mound, [ without buildings], bare to the sky, on the bank of the&nbsp; Nile near Gīza that he desires to lease, paying whatever ground rent by fixed&nbsp; instalments and optional deposit in advance as is customary in&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>such cases. [ ] It was endorsed on its verso [Let] the&nbsp; office [look] into that, if God wills. Then the following statement was written:&nbsp; The case was referred to the office of mosques [ ] and it was indicated&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it was the custom to [let as ḥikr the lands] and plots of ground that.&nbsp; [ ] .in the lands of the jazīra of Fusṭāṭ- Miṣr, and they constitute&nbsp; assets of this aforementioned office and are within the purview of my master, the&nbsp; Judge [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;if God wills. It was written in the first ten days of Ṣafar, of the year five-hundred&nbsp; and nine. He, in turn, made an endorsement addressed to the aforementioned&nbsp; office, the text of which is as follows: My master, the elder, Bū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī ibn&nbsp; Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn ʿUbaydallāh al-Qā​​ʾifī, supervisor of the government&nbsp; quarters administered in the office of mosques [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let him take cognizance of what the petition on its recto contains and what is&nbsp; stated by the office on its verso. Let him examine the land for which the lease&nbsp; has been requested and (establish) whether it is administered in this office,&nbsp; whether it is land that is permitted to be let publically as a ḥikr, whether the rent&nbsp; of its property and objects of value has been fixed ... [ ]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with a specific rent, then request from the office verification as to what the customary procedure is in such matters and apprise me of this so that I may&nbsp; execute it, God willing. The supervising witness named herein replied with the&nbsp; following note, headed by his name: I have obeyed what my master, the glorious&nbsp; judge -&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;may God prolong his life, cause to endure his support, his brilliance, his success and his wide influence and crush his enemies - instructed in his minute above and&nbsp; I have taken cognizance of what is at the top of the recto and on the verso of&nbsp; this document. I inspected the area that is alluded to in it and I found that it was&nbsp; bare, without buildings on it,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and that it was permissible to grant it as a ḥikr. I measured it and its&nbsp; measurement was, from the south side to the north side, thirty cubits and, from&nbsp; the east side to the west side, forty cubits, with sides equal in length, according to&nbsp; the (length of) cubit that is in current use.

</li>
<li>
<p>it. They mutually contracted that [ and] separated physically after it was&nbsp; completed and came into force, mutually satisfied with it and executing its&nbsp; provisions. Should any claim be made against this lessee undertaking the ḥikr with respect to what this lease contained&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by anyone, [it is the duty of the office] of Friday and neighbourhood mosques [to&nbsp; hand over what is due] to him.
