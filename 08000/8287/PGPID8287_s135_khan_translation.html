<li>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>What do our lords, the jurisconsults, the imƒÅms of the religion and guides of the&nbsp; Muslims, may God grant the success of wise men, say concerning the following.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A community of Rabbanite Jews have a synagogue of great age that still stands&nbsp;&nbsp;after many years standing with the structure and form with which its builders built it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>It still continues the customs, rites and traditional procedures regarding the&nbsp; readings and prayers throughout the year,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>on weekdays, Sabbaths and festivals. It has a prayer leader administering its affairs who has followed (the customs of) his predecessors and the corrununity is content</li>
<li>with this. People (from among them) have worked in concert to change its&nbsp; customs, stop its traditions, alter its prayers and coerce the prayer leader,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>so that an unprecedented innovation be made, while the community and the&nbsp; prayer leader wish to continue the status quo. Is&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>it permissible for unprecedented changes to be made to their traditions and for&nbsp; the prayer leader to be forced to abandon what is customary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Is it permissible for change and innovation to be made in the days of Islam, may&nbsp; God canse them to endure, even if those who effect the change are pious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><span lang="en">What action should be taken with regard to them. Grant us your opinion, may God have mercy upon you.&nbsp;</span></li>
