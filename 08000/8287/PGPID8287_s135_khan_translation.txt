In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  
What do our lords, the jurisconsults, the imāms of the religion and guides of the  Muslims, may God grant the success of wise men, say concerning the following. 
A community of Rabbanite Jews have a synagogue of great age that still stands  after many years standing with the structure and form with which its builders built it.   
It still continues the customs, rites and traditional procedures regarding the  readings and prayers throughout the year,  
on weekdays, Sabbaths and festivals. It has a prayer leader administering its affairs who has followed (the customs of) his predecessors and the corrununity is content
with this. People (from among them) have worked in concert to change its  customs, stop its traditions, alter its prayers and coerce the prayer leader,  
so that an unprecedented innovation be made, while the community and the  prayer leader wish to continue the status quo. Is  
it permissible for unprecedented changes to be made to their traditions and for  the prayer leader to be forced to abandon what is customary.  
Is it permissible for change and innovation to be made in the days of Islam, may  God canse them to endure, even if those who effect the change are pious.  
What action should be taken with regard to them. Grant us your opinion, may God have mercy upon you.
