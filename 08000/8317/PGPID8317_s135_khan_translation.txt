This is what ʿ Alī ibn [Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad, known as ibn al-Ṣīnī, the  money-changer at the door of] al-Jifār in Fusṭāṭ, bought from Ḥusayn ibn Shabāb the Jew. He bought from him, with one striking of hands and one contract,  


the whole of the quarter, six shares from twenty-four [shares ] from all of the renovated small house, concerning which this seller declared that this portion of it belonged to him, was in his ownership,  


as a valid asset and a right with legal force in his possession. They (i.e. the six shares) constitute all his right and portion of it. Half, twelve shares from  twenty-four shares, was previously in the ownership of this buyer.  


Overall, through his prior ownership and by right of this sale, he has acquired half and a quarter, eighteen shares from twenty-four shares. It is the small house  with a square door, a corridor,  


a second door, a narrow ground floor with an (ornamental) ceiling, a living room and two columns. On the upper floor there is a rail, a staircase and a 'spreading  area' overlooking its door, and also its own water conduit

and al-Qalūṣ, the warehouse, the great market and other streets and localities  adjoining one another. Four boundaries surround [enclose and contain this small  house.]  


The southern boundary extends to the ruins that are in the possession of ʿUbayd ibn Wuhayb the builder. The northern boundary extends to [ … ]

its rights, its land, its building, its timbers, whatever is within its boundaries of  whatever quantity, all rights that are known to belong to it and are attributed to it, every right belonging to it .

gold, minted coin of full weight and good alloy, in a valid purchase, legal, operative, effective, without any condition that would invalidate it or a promise that would make it void.  


This buyer paid from his clear money to this buyer all the aforementioned price and he received that from him and released him, his descendants and his heirs (from it) and from an oath upon it or upon any part of it,  


with a valid quittance, a quittance of receipt in full, it (i.e. the sum) being in  minted coin of full weight, twelve dīnars. This buyer handed over [ ... ]  


this sale mentioned in this document and he received it from him and it came  into his possession [ …]  


he is free to dispose of it as owners dispose of their property, without anyone  obstructing or preventing that for any reason. This took place after they both had  acknowledged that they had inspected [all]  


this small house and had become properly acquainted with it. They undertook the  transaction between them on this basis as stated. Then they separated physically, after the completion of this sale  


and its becoming binding, with mutual satisfaction and the intention to carry it out on the part of both of them. Should any claim be made against this buyer  with respect to anything that was entailed by this sale, mentioned in this document,  


or any part of it, or of its rights, proceeding from any other person, this seller  must hand over all that is incumbent upon him and is obligatory for him  


by way of returning a price, vouching for a value or the handing over of anything whatsoever. (He is responsible) until he delivers all that to this buyer, with a valid warranty, be he alive or dead, as his liability from his clear means, this being  


 a right for him (the buyer). They were both bound by all of this. This buyer accepted from this seller all of that, with a valid acceptance. The acknowledgement by the seller and the buyer of all of it was witnessed
