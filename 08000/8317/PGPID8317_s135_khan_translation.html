<p>This is what ʿ Alī ibn [Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad, known as ibn al-Ṣīnī, the  money-changer at the door of] al-Jifār in Fusṭāṭ, bought from Ḥusayn ibn Shabāb the Jew. He bought from him, with one striking of hands and one contract,  </p>

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>with a valid quittance, a quittance of receipt in full, it (i.e. the sum) being in  minted coin of full weight, twelve dīnars. This buyer handed over [ ... ]  </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>he is free to dispose of it as owners dispose of their property, without anyone  obstructing or preventing that for any reason. This took place after they both had  acknowledged that they had inspected [all]  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this small house and had become properly acquainted with it. They undertook the  transaction between them on this basis as stated. Then they separated physically, after the completion of this sale  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and its becoming binding, with mutual satisfaction and the intention to carry it out on the part of both of them. Should any claim be made against this buyer  with respect to anything that was entailed by this sale, mentioned in this document,  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or any part of it, or of its rights, proceeding from any other person, this seller  must hand over all that is incumbent upon him and is obligatory for him  </p>
