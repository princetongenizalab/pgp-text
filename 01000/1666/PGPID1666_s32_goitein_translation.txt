Recto
[ ... May your rule last] for ever. 
The grandmother [of the orphans so-and-so and so-and-so has died and there is now no one] who looks after them ex[cept myself]. Those two dinars which are taken for them [suffice only] for a piece of bread in normal times.
Also here is the wife of Rabbi [Joseph], the cantor, a student of the late member of the academy al-Kāmukhī; she has no child and would like to take these two girls and teach them embroidery; moreover, someone should come to the house and teach them the prayer so that they should not grow up like animals and not even know "Hear, oh Israel." She should live near my house so that I should be able to inspect their doings from time to time. 
The elder girl has attained puberty last year and her younger sister is slightly above ten years. They constantly say to your maidservant: "We want to come to you so that you may take care of us." But your maidservant says: "I act only at the instruction of our lord, may his glory be enhanced." I do not wish that they should stay with me in the same house, but a place should be rented for them in my neighborhood, and this woman, the wife of the cantor Rabbi Joseph, should take care of them with regard to their work and other matters. Those two dinars should be handed over to the elder girl, who will spend them on their maintenance, the silk, and other matters. But how appropriate for you [to increase their share. May God] give you double reward and always be your support and may He keep your sons, the p[rinces …]. 
 
May the welfare of your excellency always increase and never decrease. And this may be His w[ill].
