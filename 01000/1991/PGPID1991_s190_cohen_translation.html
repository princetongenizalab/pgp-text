                        <p>"While you shall be (called) Priests of the Lord," etc. (Isaiah 61:6) [...Your slave...] kisses the ground before (our) m(aster) and t(eacher) Joseph ha-Kohen the beloved Dignitary, Crown of the Priests, Diadem of the Dignitaries, and informs you that I am [going through] adversity that none but the Creator of all existence knows. I am hiding out in the house like the women. I cannot go out except [in the] evening. I am fleeing from a debt that I owe. I am unable to do any gainful work unless I go out. My 1ittle ones are dying of hunger because I have been hiding out. Our 1ord the Head promised me the pledges of a week (jumʿa). When the week I was to have claimed the pledge that he promised arrived, I was told that it had gone to the elder Bū Saʿd the cantor, (may his) Rock) p(rotect him). I therefore ask my master please to intercede on my behalf so that I am paid that w(eek's pledges), for I have heard that nothing is accomplished without the decision of my master, may God grant you success. I am all the more dependent upon you. And peace.&nbsp;</p>
