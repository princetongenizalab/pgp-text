I hereby inform you that I have arrived safely, by the grace of God, the exalted. I informed the group (jamāʿa) what happened and they were very happy. Now, if you can, go to Abū ʿAlī and bid him to go to Abū Zikrī so that he will write a (letter of) appointment regarding what I had mentioned in the pubic letter (kitāb al-jamāʿa), may it be a success.
Abū al-Khayr troubled my heart when he told me that my brother, Abū Isḥāq, may I be his ransom, beat my paternal uncleʼs wife. Do me a favor and inform me what you hear from Abū Zikrī, may the Rock (preserve him). Let him write me (letter of) appointment according to what I mentioned in the public letter.

If you can, do something concerning the love that is between me and them, may it be a success, and peace.
