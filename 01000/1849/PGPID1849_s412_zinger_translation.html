                        <p>I hereby inform you that I have arrived safely, by the grace of God, the exalted. I informed the group (jamāʿa) what happened and they were very happy. Now, if you can, go to Abū ʿAlī and bid him to go to Abū Zikrī so that he will write a (letter of) appointment regarding what I had mentioned in the pubic letter (kitāb al-jamāʿa), may it be a success.</p>
<p>Abū al-Khayr troubled my heart when he told me that my brother, Abū Isḥāq, may I be his ransom, beat my paternal uncleʼs wife. Do me a favor and inform me what you hear from Abū Zikrī, may the Rock (preserve him). Let him write me (letter of) appointment according to what I mentioned in the public letter. Whatever happened, let me know. And let me know why Abū Isḥāq beat my uncleʼs wife. May I not be deprived of your life, and peace.</p>
<p>If you can, do something concerning the love that is between me and them, may it be a success, and peace.</p>

<p>(2-3) May God, the exalted, help you and not deprive us from seeing your face.</p>
<p>(4-11) Regarding Abū al-Khayr telling you that Abū Isḥāq talked with the wife of your uncle, it was only that they said: &ldquo;By God! You are not good enough for us for you are relatives of Muslims and because of this you deserve to be put under the ban.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(12-18) He answered: &ldquo;By God! We have no Muslim among us at all! The one who deserves to be put under the ban is he who casts evil among people and corrupts the state of intimacy with their partners. Such a person (ought to be) placed under the ban ...&nbsp;</p>
