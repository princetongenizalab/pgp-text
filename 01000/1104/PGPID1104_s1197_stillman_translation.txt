The transaction that took place before us as witnesses was as follows: 
On the Sabbath, the 19th of the month in the year [....] we were present at the home of the Ḥaver Natan. We found there Abū l-Ḥasan, the sugar merchant ill, lying upon his bed. His senses were present and his mind was sound. He knew what he was saying, and what was said to him just as well people who conduct affairs in the marketplace. He knew each one of us by name and person. We asked him concerning the time, and he andswered that as one should answer, and after that he left instructions regarding his opligations to the following persons. Stating: I took from the Elder, Abū Naṣr, sugar for six dinars in order to sell it and pay him its cost, but Fate has caught up with me. And [the sugar] is in my shop as it was. I have not done any transaction with it, and he has recieved a third of its price. It will be returned to him. I am responsible to Sawād, the sugar-merchant, for paying the remainder of the poll tax for two dinars. Pay this in my name. I have excluded from my estate Shibl, the son of my paternal aunt with two dinars. It should be paid to him.
 
Then he turned to the Ḥaver Rabbi Natan and said: I wish that you wrap me in a fine burial garment, have cut for me a Baghdadi Niṣfiyya and a jubbah of new staba cloth, a turban, and a new chest. And these are the last provisions of my property. And if there remains anything after all these funeral expenses and after whatever is to be pain in my name, it is to be a gift to my maternal aunt. 
And he entrusted the Ḥaver with all that was to be transacted on his behalf as two witnesses. And we left him. And his death fell on Sunday the 20th, succumbing to that illness of his. And to my wife I leave 30 dinars. It should be paid to her. And Abū Naṣr al-Kohen owes me 750 dirhams and with those my debts should be paid.
