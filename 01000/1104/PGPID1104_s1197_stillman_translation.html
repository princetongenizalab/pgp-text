<li>The transaction that took place before us as witnesses was as follows:</li>
<li>On the Sabbath, the 19th of the month in the year 1453 [Sel.] we were present at the home of the Ḥaver Natan.</li>
<li>We found there Abū l-Ḥasan, the sugar merchant ill, lying upon</li>
<li>his bed. His senses were present and his mind was sound. He knew what</li>
<li>he was saying, and what was said to him just as well people who conduct affairs</li>
<li>in the marketplace. He knew each one of us by name and person. We asked him</li>
<li>concerning the time, and he answered that as one should answer, and after that he left instructions</li>
<li>regarding his opligations to the following persons. Stating: I took from the Elder Abū Naṣr</li>
<li>//sugar// for six dinars in order to sell it and pay him its cost, but Fate has caught up with me.</li>
<li>It [the sugar] is in my shop as it was. I have not done any transaction with it, and he has recieved a third of its price.</li>
<li>It will be returned to him. I am responsible to Sawād, the sugar-merchant, for three dinars, which should be paid</li>
<li>from the shop. I am responsible for paying the remainder of the poll tax for two dinars. Pay this in my name.</li>
<li>I have excluded from my estate Shibl, the son of my paternal aunt with two dinars. It should be paid</li>
<li>to him. Then he turned to the Ḥaver Rabbi Natan and said: I wish that you wrap me in a fine burial garment,</li>
<li>have cut for me a Baghdadi Niṣfiyya and a jubbah of new ʿatāba cloth,</li>
<li>a turban, and a new chest. And these are the last provisions of</li>
<li>my property. And if there remains anything after all these funeral expenses and after whatever is to be pain in my name, it is to be a gift</li>
<li>to my maternal aunt. And he entrusted the Ḥaver with all that was to be transacted on his behalf</li>
<li>as two witnesses. And we left him. And his death fell on Sunday the 20th,</li>
<li>succumbing to that illness of his.&nbsp;</li>

<li>And to my wife I leave 30 dinars. It should be paid to her. And Abū Naṣr al-Kohen al-Ṣayrafī owes me 750 dirhams and with those my debts should be paid.&nbsp;</li>
