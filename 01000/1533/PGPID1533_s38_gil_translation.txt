Verso


I am happy that your Honor, al-Shaykh al-Wātīq, may God preserve you, recovered. 


I send you 40 dir. 


with the bearer (of this letter), with which you should discharge (the debt) for the removal 


(4-6) of garbage, and keep for yourself two dir. A day for the past days (in which) repairs (were done). Now as to the cow; 

 
 

(7-8) do not rent it any more, since one cup, in the mornings and evenings, would be enough for you, 

 

but do it constantly, since it quenches one's thirst. And do not 


by any means act contrarily to the opinion of al-Ḥājj 


ʿAlī al-Sharawī, if he gives you some advice, 


nor let any other lessee enter the place 


(13-14) but him. And then there is nothing else any more to be done in the plantation until we conclude

 

another agreement with the lessee, 


of which I will also inform you myself. 


And if you would like to come in (and see me) after (this) Saturday, 


so come. And may your welfare be increased.
