<li>
<p>I am happy that your Honor, al-Shaykh al-Wātīq, may God preserve you, recovered.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I send you 40 dir.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the bearer (of this letter), with which you should discharge (the debt) for the removal&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(4-6) of garbage, and keep for yourself two dir. A day for the past days (in which) repairs (were done). Now as to the cow;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>(7-8) do not rent it any more, since one cup, in the mornings and evenings, would be enough for you,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>but do it constantly, since it quenches one's thirst. And do not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by any means act contrarily to the opinion of al-Ḥājj&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ʿAlī al-Sharawī, if he gives you some advice,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor let any other lessee enter the place&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(13-14) but him. And then there is nothing else any more to be done in the plantation until we conclude</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>another agreement with the lessee,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of which I will also inform you myself.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if you would like to come in (and see me) after (this) Saturday,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so come. And may your welfare be increased.</p>
</li>
</ol>
