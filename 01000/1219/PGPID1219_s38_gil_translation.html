<li>the year thousand …. of the documents, in the city of Damascus that is situated on the  (Amānā and Parpar) rivers</li>

<li>(the son of ….) ha-Levi, the Honorable Elder, the Pride of the Levites and their Glory, of blessed memory, and we found him</li>
<li>(sick, lying in his bed, while his senses were with him), his mind was sound. So we asked what time it was and who the persons (present) were, and he answered us like</li>
<li>(all people who negotiate on their  feet in the market, saying ….) from now on I have donated to Their Honor</li>
<li>…. Honorable, Wise, Intelligent, the Distinguished Judge, the Excellent Sage,</li>

<li>…. (a gift that is ….) complete, valid, legal against anything that might (be) brought up</li>
<li>…. (each) of them (I declared) trustworthy in whatever he would do, like two able witnesses</li>
<li>…. (and they are released from any oath) even from an anonymous ban. Each of them may nominate an overseer</li>
