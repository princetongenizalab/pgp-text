Al-Fakhr, may God protect him, went with us when
we set out for Rabbi Moshe's [house] but he [preferred] for his part to remain
at the entrance to the house while I and al-Jalāl proceeded to enter.
I kissed his noble hand
and he received us with a most cordial welcome.
He said to me, "Come and be seated young man,"
beckoning me to sit
on the edge of the īwān, opposite where
he [himself] was seated
whilst he sat at the other end
of the īwān. So I sat down while he read the message
which I gave him, from beginning
to end. He was delighted with the presents
and started to play with al-Jalāl, may God protect him. There was no one else
seated on the w~wn save him,
Rabbi Abraham, and myself.

The master seemed favourably inclined. In the meantime
Rabbi Avraham, may God protect him, had taught al-(alal [8] a term with which to address [9] Rabbi Moses. Upon his reciting it [Rabbi Moses] laughed [10] with amusement and sported with the [child]. [11] I was the first to leave [the house], [12] while al-Gall remained behind talking to the usher [13] in the vestibule. Whereupon Rabbi Moses [14] enquired of Rabbi Abraham 'Where has his son gone ? ' [15] 'He is standing by the door ', he replied. ' Go and call him ', he said, while re-entering [the door], [17] whereupon he came across the [child who again] recited the form of address. [18] Peace.
