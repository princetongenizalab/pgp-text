[Section:]
Al-Fakhr, may God protect him, went with us when
we set out for Rabbi Moshe's [house] but he [preferred] for his part to remain
at the entrance to the house while I and al-Jalāl proceeded to enter.
I kissed his noble hand
and he received us with a most cordial welcome.
He said to me, "Come and be seated young man,"
beckoning me to sit
on the edge of the īwān, opposite where
he [himself] was seated
whilst he sat at the other end
of the īwān. So I sat down while he read the message
which I gave him, from beginning
to end. He was delighted with the presents
and started to play with al-Jalāl, may God protect him. There was no one else
seated on the īwān save him,
Rabbi Avraham, and myself.

Then there transpired that which a book
would prove insufficient to describe. Next, caskets were brought
and he began to eat lemon cakes.
We stayed [just] for a while but he detained me
in order that we confer a moment confidentially.
The master seemed favourably inclined. In the meantime
Rabbi Avraham, may God protect him, had taught al-Jalāl
a term with which to address
Rabbi Moshe. Upon his reciting it [Rabbi Moshe] laughed
with amusement and sported with the [child].
I was the first to leave [the house],
while al-Jalāl remained behind talking to the usher
in the vestibule. Whereupon Rabbi Moshe
enquired of Rabbi Avraham, "Where has his son gone?"
"He is standing by the door," he replied.
"Go and call him," he said, while re-entering [the door],
whereupon he came across the [child who again] recited the form of address.
Peace.
