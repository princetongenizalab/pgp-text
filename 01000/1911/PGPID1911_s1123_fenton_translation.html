<li>Al-Fakhr, may God protect him, went with us when</li>
<li>we set out for Rabbi Moshe's [house] but he [preferred] for his part to remain</li>
<li>at the entrance to the house while I and al-Jalāl proceeded to enter.</li>
<li>I kissed his noble hand</li>
<li>and he received us with a most cordial welcome.</li>
<li>He said to me, "Come and be seated young man,"</li>
<li>beckoning me to sit</li>
<li>on the edge of the īwān, opposite where</li>
<li>he [himself] was seated</li>
<li>whilst he sat at the other end</li>
<li>of the īwān. So I sat down while he read the message</li>
<li>which I gave him, from beginning</li>
<li>to end. He was delighted with the presents</li>
<li>and started to play with al-Jalāl, may God protect him. There was no one else</li>
<li>seated on the w~wn save him,</li>
<li>Rabbi Abraham, and myself.</li>

<li>Then there transpired that which a book</li>
<li>would prove insufficient to describe. Next, caskets were brought</li>
<li>and he began to eat lemon cakes.</li>
<li>We stayed [just] for a while but he detained me</li>
<li>in order that we confer a moment confidentially.</li>
<li>The master seemed favourably inclined. In the meantime</li>
<li>Rabbi Avraham, may God protect him, had taught al-(alal [8] a term with which to address [9] Rabbi Moses. Upon his reciting it [Rabbi Moses] laughed [10] with amusement and sported with the [child]. [11] I was the first to leave [the house], [12] while al-Gall remained behind talking to the usher [13] in the vestibule. Whereupon Rabbi Moses [14] enquired of Rabbi Abraham 'Where has his son gone ? ' [15] 'He is standing by the door ', he replied. ' Go and call him ', he said, while re-entering [the door], [17] whereupon he came across the [child who again] recited the form of address. [18] Peace.</li>
