 …our dear… b. R...., may God preserve him, 


 concerning his appointment as administrator of the heqdēsh, under the authority of His Highness, the Excellent Nāgīd, 


(3-4) our Master Samuel b. Ḥananyā, may God bless him, and his court, may God preserve them. On the .. of the month Adar 1461 

 

 His Highness the Nāgīd, his court, and the elders issued a written order that our Lord 


 and Master Isaiah ha-Levi be the administrator and overseer over the affairs of the Jews 


 in Fustat, the synagogues, the synagogue of Dammūh and its plantations, 


 the scrolls of the Torah, the vessels (for oil), the wrappers, the books and all other things, 


 and so forth. There will be no hand over his, nor any opinion over his. Anything which 


 he will think to be right, and any expenditures made by him will not be under control. He is allowed to appoint 


(11-12) his own representatives and deputies according to his own considerations, since his righteousness and correct conduct are known . . . No courts, neither those that exist 

 

 at present nor those that will come after them.. . .will be at his heels, 


 nor at those of his bookkeeping. No anonymous ban, or oath or (oath by) implication (will regard him). He is as trustworthy 


(15-16) as two able witnesses. To this His Highness, the Nāgīd, and his court, affixed their signatures: Samuel b. R. Ḥananyā, of blessed memory. Ḥiyyā b. R. Isaac,o f blessed memory. 

 

(17-18) Ephraim b. R. Meshullām, of blessed memory. Nathan b. R. Samuel he-Ḥāvēr, of blessed memory.
