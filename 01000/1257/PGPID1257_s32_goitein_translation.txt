Recto
In Y(our name) O Me(rciful) !  
O you, whose servant I am, I have requested you several times to teach my little one every week the portion from the Prophets belonging to the weekly lection. Likewise, it is customary for teachers to let the boys read the sections of the Bible appropriate to each season, such as the Book of Esther for Purim, and the Song of Songs for Passover, as well as other texts recited during the holidays. For if I do not ascend the platform with him having him read in the synagogue, he will not learn at all. So please, teach him the portions from the Prophets and the Scroll of Esther. And peace!
