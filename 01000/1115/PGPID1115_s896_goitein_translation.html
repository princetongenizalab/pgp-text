                        <h3>Recto (verso as conserved)</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>A testimony that there appeared before us, we the undersigned witnesses,</li>
<li>the elder Abī l-Riḍā, (his) h(onor), g(reatness and) h(oliness), (our) m(aster and) t(eacher)</li>
<li>Yaʿaqov, the honored elder, the noble and generous, son of (his) h(onor), g(reatness and) h(oliness), (our) m(aster and) t(eacher) Yosef</li>
<li>the elder (may he) r(est in) E(den), and said to us: "I had intended to take over the tax farming (ḍamān) al-Maḥalla al-Kubrā,</li>
<li>which is in the hand of the elder Abī l-Faraj, (our) m(aster) Yeshuʿa, son of R. Avraham, (may he) r(est in) E(den), and of his son</li>
<li>Abī l-Khayr. Then I pondered over the straitened circumstances of these people, their liabilities</li>
<li>and indebtedness to the dīwān and thought that if I took that thing (al-bāb)</li>
<li>from them through machinations (siyāsa), force and getting the better of them, they would suffer damage,</li>
<li>both from the side of (their relation with) the dīwān and their loss of income. Thus, considering their welfare</li>
<li>prior to my own and confident that with God's favorable decree and help the welfare of</li>
<li>all of us would be served, I make this proposal. Of the debts of</li>
<li>these people, I pledge to pay to the dīwān 80</li>
<li>dinars //in the course of four years//, 20 dinars each year, not more than that. Whatever might be above</li>
<li>that sum I am not obliged to pay. This on condition that the</li>
<li>superintendent (mushrif) and director (ʿāmil) grant me the tax farming at the same estimate and price</li>
<li>imposed on them at present without any rise and that</li>
<li>they also relinguish the lease (ḍamān) and transfer it to the aforementioned elder Abī</li>
<li>l-Riḍā (i.e., me) without rise." The aforementioned declared</li>
<li>that the estimate of the lease (ḍamān) imposed on them amounted to</li>
<li>335 dīnārs. If the superintendent</li>
<li>and director would be prepared to transfer the lease solely with a rise, then</li>
<li>the rise would be included in the sum of 80 dinars mentioned before, and</li>
<li>the elder Abū l-Riḍā would not be obliged to anything more than</li>
<li>80 dinars for both payment of their debt and a possible rise." On these conditions</li>
<li>the symbolic purchase was made by us from the aforementioned elder Abū l-Riḍā and also</li>
<li>from the aforementioned elder Abū l-Faraj and his son especially on their obligation</li>
<li>to transfer the lease (ḍamān); we made it completely and strictly, valid as from now,</li>
<li>in the prescribed manner, voiding all secret depositions and stipulations. This happened</li>
<li>during the first ten days of the month of Elul, 1458. Correct, valid and confirmed.</li>
