<li>There appeared before us the elder Abu l-Riḍā, (his) h(onor), g(reatness and) h(oliness), (our) m(aster and) t(eacher) Yaʿaqov, the honored elder, the noble and generous, son of (his) h(onor), g(reatness and) h(oliness), (our) m(aster and) t(eacher) Yosef the elder (may he) r(est in) E(den), and said to us: "I had intended to take over the tax farming of great al-Maḥalla, which is in the hand of the elder Abu l-Faraj, (our) m(aster) Yeshuʿa, son of R. Avraham, (may he) r(est in) E(den), and of his son Abū l-Khayr. Then I pondered over the straitened circusmtances of these peope, their liabilities and indebtedness to the dīwān and thought that if I took that thing from them through machinations, force and getting the better of them, they would suffer damage, both from the side of their relaiton with the dīwān and thieer loss of income. Thus, convisdering thier welfare prior to my own and confident that with God's fabvorable decree and help the welfare of allof us would be served, I make this proposal. Of the debts of these people, I pledge to pay to the dīwān 80 dinars //in the course of four years//, 20 dinars each year, not more than that. Whatever might be above that sum I am not obliged to pay. This on condiition that the superintendent and dirctor of that office grant me the tax farming at the same estimate and price imposed on them at present without any rise and that htey relinguish the lease and transfer it to the aforementioned elder Abū l-Riḍā (i.e., me) without rise." The aforementioned declared that the estimate of the lease imposed on them amounted to 335 dīnārs. If the superintendent and director of the dīwān would be prepared to transfer the lease solely with a rise, then thie rise would be included in the sume of 80 dinars, mentioned before, and the elder Abū l-Riḍā would not be obliged to anything mroe than 80 dinars for both payment of their debt and a possible rise." On these conditions the symolic purchase was made by us from the aforementioned elder Abū l-Riḍā and also from the aforementioned elder Abū l-Faraj and his son especially on their obligation to transfer the lease; we made it completely and strictly, valid as from now, in the precsribed manner, voiding all secret depositions and stipulations. This happened during the first ten days of the month of Elul, 1458. Correct, valid and confirmed. (SIgned by) Zakkay b. Moshe, (may he) r(est) i(n) E(den). ʿAmram b. R. Yaʿaqov, (may he) r(est) i(n) E(den).&nbsp;</li>
