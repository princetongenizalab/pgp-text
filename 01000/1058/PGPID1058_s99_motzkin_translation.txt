Recto


"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life."


The servant informs the domicile of the dear


young man, the noble branch, the one who (both) knows (the commandments)


and performs (them), our master and teacher Bera'kho't the wise


scholar and teacher, may his name exist forever;


I inform you that I am very anxious to hear


your happy news, and that I never stop telling about


and asking about your honor everyone who arrives


from your place. When I hear that you are


healthy and well I am very happy. We had


expected your coming on S'abbat Bere'si't.


The "sound one" longs for you and asks about you


constantly. I did intend to come down instead of sending this letter,


and had in mind asking your advice. Know, that this


place does not pay me enough even for the poll-tax, nor for


clothes or living expenses, except for myself, for I get


no more than five (dirhems a week), while I need every day


at least three quarters (of a dirhem) for living expenses,


and I don't earn enough even for washing


a suit of clothes. They did budget for me on (the Day of) Atonement


seventy dirhems in the presence of the elder al-Rashi'd,


but until today I did not receive more


than four dirhems. The elder


"the sound" fulfilled his debt,


both his son Thana'' and also S'e'mu'l and Mus'awwir promised fifty


dirhems but, - as God is my witness, I received


only one dirhem from S'e'mu'l. What shall I do?


To whom shall I speak? "By day the heat consumed me


and my sleep fled from my eyes."
