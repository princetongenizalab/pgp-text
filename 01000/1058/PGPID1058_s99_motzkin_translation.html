                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The servant informs the domicile of the dear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>young man, the noble branch, the one who (both) knows (the commandments)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and performs (them), our master and teacher Bera'kho't the wise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scholar and teacher, may his name exist forever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I inform you that I am very anxious to hear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your happy news, and that I never stop telling about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and asking about your honor everyone who arrives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from your place. When I hear that you are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>healthy and well I am very happy. We had</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expected your coming on S'abbat Bere'si't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "sound one" longs for you and asks about you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>constantly. I did intend to come down instead of sending this letter,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and had in mind asking your advice. Know, that this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>place does not pay me enough even for the poll-tax, nor for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clothes or living expenses, except for myself, for I get</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no more than five (dirhems a week), while I need every day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at least three quarters (of a dirhem) for living expenses,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and I don't earn enough even for washing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a suit of clothes. They did budget for me on (the Day of) Atonement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seventy dirhems in the presence of the elder al-Rashi'd,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but until today I did not receive more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>than four dirhems. The elder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"the sound" fulfilled his debt,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>both his son Thana'' and also S'e'mu'l and Mus'awwir promised fifty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dirhems but, - as God is my witness, I received</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only one dirhem from S'e'mu'l. What shall I do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To whom shall I speak? "By day the heat consumed me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and my sleep fled from my eyes."</p>
</li>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Our master the chief had promised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(your) servant a year ago today (to pay for me) all of the poll-tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year came and a year went by, and I did not receive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anything from him. So I have become perplexed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in thinking about what I ought to do. "Whither shall I go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from thy spirit?" I do ask you to endeavor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to sell my booklets that (I deposited) with you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as much as you can, or else hand them over to someone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who will travel around with them (trying to sell them). I had sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the young man, son of the So'fe'r the grocer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>four books and said to him, "hand them over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the elder Baraka't son of the judge or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the teacher, the elder Ma'a'li'." I ask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you to endeavor to sell them. Whatever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they yield is from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God and you. Inform your father (of my state)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and greet him; perhaps he could mention your servant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to our master. Let me know what happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no friends left except</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God and you. Don't delay in (settling) my affairs and don't</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>....... . If you don't arrange it, I will come to live with you in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your house and you will suffer from me. May the letter of my patron</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be received by his servant accompanied by something which one may lean</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>against. Peace. To your father and whoever else is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with you best of peace. May you have peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your house have peace. Don't think badly of me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your slave Da'u'd son of the H'a've'r from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>       Qalyu'b</p>
