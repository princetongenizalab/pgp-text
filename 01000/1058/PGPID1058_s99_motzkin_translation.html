                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>"The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The servant informs the domicile of the dear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>young man, the noble branch, the one who (both) knows (the commandments)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and performs (them), our master and teacher Bera'kho't the wise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scholar and teacher, may his name exist forever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I inform you that I am very anxious to hear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your happy news, and that I never stop telling about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and asking about your honor everyone who arrives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from your place. When I hear that you are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>healthy and well I am very happy. We had</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expected your coming on S'abbat Bere'si't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "sound one" longs for you and asks about you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>constantly. I did intend to come down instead of sending this letter,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and had in mind asking your advice. Know, that this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>place does not pay me enough even for the poll-tax, nor for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clothes or living expenses, except for myself, for I get</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no more than five (dirhems a week), while I need every day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at least three quarters (of a dirhem) for living expenses,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and I don't earn enough even for washing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a suit of clothes. They did budget for me on (the Day of) Atonement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>seventy dirhems in the presence of the elder al-Rashi'd,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but until today I did not receive more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>than four dirhems. The elder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"the sound" fulfilled his debt,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>both his son Thana'' and also S'e'mu'l and Mus'awwir promised fifty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dirhems but, - as God is my witness, I received</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only one dirhem from S'e'mu'l. What shall I do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To whom shall I speak? "By day the heat consumed me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and my sleep fled from my eyes."</p>
</li>
</ol>
