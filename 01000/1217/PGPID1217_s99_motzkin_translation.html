<li>
<p>       The distinguished master's goodness…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and punishing her every Friday. However, your own words testify against you, and the proof is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you say, "She does not (even)comb her hair!". (Listen), intelligent one! If she were</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>feeling well, would she go without combing her hair? For,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>were she all right, her body would be perfumed, her hair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>combed and parted and she would put her eye-shadow on. As to what you say</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that she's shameless and insolent - she's your own, and belongs to you - she's your maternal aunt's daughter! Does a Jew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accuse a child of Israel of shamelessness? My master (evidently) does not know that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the word waqih' is (used for the translation of the Hebrew) 'az pa'ni'm and mamze'r ben nidda'h. Let my virtuous master</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.beware of using this word! Coming now to your complaint that she</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does not do her chores. Your mother does not know what she actually does. It is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>concealed from her. How do you expect anything of the housework to be done perfectly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use her as a maid? For you know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she is alone, in strange surroundings, an orphan and (so) young. She has no</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one to lean upon, except God - may He help her in His good ways and console her in her orphanhood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now my master knows that we accepted the fact that she lives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with you and that we are separated from her. We rely on your</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>generosity, your chivalry, your piety, your learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your noble lineage. We are all agreed that you are chivalrous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and know that you will not destroy her (life) by coercing her, for you are so politic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and manage things so well. May God be good to you and will make you prosper in this world and the next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        By th'e' 'T'orah, my brother wanted to come to you; however, he</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is afraid of (people) talking and of gossip among Cairenes: and foreigners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be as good as you can to her: doing good will put things in order</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for you. Receive special greetings from me, and greet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your dear father, may God not deprive us of him and his prayer.for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greet for me the dear doctor, the elder "the sound", may God lengthen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his life; greet the gracious lady Sitt Rayh'a'n;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your sister (too), may God honor her; (also) Sitt al-Khayr and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the elder Samh'u'n. Greet Sitt Ghaza'l for me and inform her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that I have a boy now whose name is Hila'l;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God grant her children soon. Read her (aloud)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the following words: Sitt Ghaza'l! Remember the training you received</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by your mother and father. I swear you by (the God) who will let me see you have a son,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to do and act in the same way you used to act toward your father, grandfather and uncle;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(to act in this way) toward the judge, your great patron, your husband</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your aunt, namely that every morning and evening you will kiss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[their hands …]</p>
</li>
