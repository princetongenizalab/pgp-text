                        <ol><li>Joseph b. Ḥassān (al-)Mahdawī     The debt was (two) dina(rs) as a (complete) debt     Abū al-Ḥasan remained      Kislev and Ṭevet      He was not obligated in an oath</li><li>Proceedings (of what) took place before us—we, the undersigned. Thus: in the month of Marḥeshvan of the year one thousand fou[r]</li><li>hundred and fifty-five (of the Era) of Documents in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, the jurisdiction of our lord Samuel the great Nag[id,]</li><li>may his name endure forever, there proceeded a partnership (shirka) between Khalaf b. Abū al-Ḥasan al-Damsīsī and Joseph b. Ḥassān a[l-]</li><li>Mahdawī, when they went to Upper Egypt, in the production of purple dye. The two of separated from (their partnership)</li><li>under circumstances which would take a long time to relate, the end of which is that each of them performed a qinyan with his fellow using the most certain stipulations of qinyan,</li><li>with the formula “effective immediately”, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions, that he has released him from all claims and the</li><li>demands and the obligations and responsibilities, from the beginning of time up till now; and from all types of vows,</li><li>grave and simple, even ḥerem setam and rider (oaths). No claim remains for either of them with the other</li><li>whatsoever, except for two dinars which remains owned by Joseph b. Ḥassān tor the aforementioned Khalaf b. Abū al-Ḥasan from</li><li>the balance of this partnership (shirka) as a complete debt and an outstanding loan, an obligatory debt and a binding claim against this Joseph b. Ḥassān</li><li>and upon his heirs, for this Khalaf and for his heirs after him. We, the undersigned, performed a qinyan with this Joseph </li><li>b. Ḥassān and this Khalaf b. Abū al-Ḥasan, a complete and weighty qinyan, with an item suitable for doing so, effective immediately,</li><li>in accordance with his intention and without any sort of duress at all, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions, that he owes and is indebted to him for good, weighed specie,</li><li>to (be paid) to this Khalaf, two dinars’ exactly, as a complete obligation and an outstanding loan. He will pay therefrom one dinar </li><li>in the month of Kislev following (the month of) Marḥeshvan dated above, and in the month of Ṭevet following it, the other dinar.</li><li>When Ṭevet ends, if something out of the two dinars remains with him (Joseph), he shall be obligated for a sum equivalent to that still unpaid</li><li>as a religious endowment for the poor, as a gift for them, effective immediately. He will not give a single dirham from these […] without</li><li>recording it on the back of th[is do]cument. If he (Joseph) claims having paid some of this, and it is not fixed on the back of this </li><li>document, then his claim therein will be ignored, and the words of this Khalaf his counterparty shall be considered tr[ustworthy] in that which he says concerning</li><li>what remains for him from (the total debt mentioned) in this document, and if he demands all of it, he does not have to take any oath whatsoever therein,</li><li>even ḥerem setam, or a rider oath. Then, after effecting the qinyan from the two of them, ev//erything//</li><li>we outlined we confirmed in order that it would be a title of right and proof from this day forward. Proper and clear and enduring </li><li>Nathan ha-Kohen b. Solomon ha-Kohen (who) r(ests in) E(den) Nathan b. Samuel the Ḥaver  (may his) m(emory be) f(or a blessing) </li></ol>
