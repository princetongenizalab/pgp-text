                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>
<p>In Thy Name, oh Merciful!&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of these lines is to inform Your Honor,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our Master may he Live for ever, that I received a letter from His Honor,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the gaon, by which I was ordered to invite&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abūʾ1-Ḥasan b. al-Ḥazzān and to demand from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rent of one of the compounds of the qōdesh, for which&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the overseers said that there was arrears of two months, 46</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dir., to the month of Tammuz. So I had him come</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and read before him the letter. The tenant said:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were 4 ⅔ months. I sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>him through our Master 29 dir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and 14 dir. through Sālim al-Wakīl, and 20 dir.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have been paid to al-Shaykh Abūʾ1-Ḥasan b. Ghulayb&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in order to pay them to the overseer. So they still owed him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only 12 dir. These they sent&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with their son to al-Shaykh Abūʾ1-Bayān.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this their lease ended. They handed over&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the key to the Karaite who lives in&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that compound. so do not worry about the vacancy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <p>of these two months, since 32 dir. were added to what they owed during those five months.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, upper margin</h3>

<li>
<p>(1-2) So please, after (this) his account, take&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>(3-4) from him the copper lid of the jar&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>(5-7) and hand it over to Abūʾ1-Bayān. So you will set his account right and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>(8-11) the speedy time of (giving) the answer will spare them his reproaches. I kiss your hand.&nbsp;</p>
