Recto


In Thy Name, oh Merciful! 


The purpose of these lines is to inform Your Honor, 


our Master may he Live for ever, that I received a letter from His Honor, 


the gaon, by which I was ordered to invite 


Abūʾ1-Ḥasan b. al-Ḥazzān and to demand from him


the rent of one of the compounds of the qōdesh, for which 


the overseers said that there was arrears of two months, 46


dir., to the month of Tammuz. So I had him come


and read before him the letter. The tenant said:


There were 4 ⅔ months. I sent


him through our Master 29 dir.


and 14 dir. through Sālim al-Wakīl, and 20 dir. 


have been paid to al-Shaykh Abūʾ1-Ḥasan b. Ghulayb 


in order to pay them to the overseer. So they still owed him 


only 12 dir. These they sent 


with their son to al-Shaykh Abūʾ1-Bayān.


With this their lease ended. They handed over 


the key to the Karaite who lives in 


that compound. so do not worry about the vacancy 


 
Recto, right margin
of these two months, since 32 dir. were added to what they owed during those five months.
Recto, upper margin


(1-2) So please, after (this) his account, take 

 

(3-4) from him the copper lid of the jar 

 

(5-7) and hand it over to Abūʾ1-Bayān. So you will set his account right and 

 
 

(8-11) the speedy time of (giving) the answer will spare them his reproaches. I kiss your hand.
