Recto
(We acquire from Hiba) 


 . . . . as a complete and solemn acquisition, with an instrument that is proper to acquire with, 


 (from now on, with his agreement), without any compulsion, declaring void any declarations or conditions, that he rents the above-mentioned plantation for a period of eight full years 


 according to the dates mentioned above, their full account being of 88 dinars. He will pay 9 2⁄3 dinars every year, in the month of


 Tishri, after 1 2⁄3 dinars have been computed to his credit by monthly payments during the eleven previous months, to the end of his lease. He undertakes to cut one thousand 


 palm branches from the plantation and carry them to the Nile. He will not illegally cut down anything from the trees of the plantation which may harm or destroy it. It is his obligation to bear all the expenditures of the plantation. 


 He will not allow any turning (period) of the sāqiya to lapse and will provide it with cattle. He accepts all the conditions recorded above in this deed. We also 


 acquire from the administrator of the heqdēsh, al-Shaykh Abū ʿAlī al-Neʾemān, as a complete and solemn acquisition, with an instrument that is proper to acquire with, from now on, with his agreement, without any compulsion, declaring void 


 any declarations or conditions, that he is under obligation to the named Hiba, the lessee, for all the conditions that he laid upon him above in this deed and that he will require from him absolutely nothing that is beyond them. 


 Therefore, we wrote and signed it, and made of it two copies, one for the lessor and the other one for the lessee so that it be as a title and proof as from 


 today. (Cancellations occurring in the document are noted.) And all this is sound, firm, and valid.
