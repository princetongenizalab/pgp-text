Recto

My lord and master, may God lengthen his existence and preserve his benefaction, and may He act for him and with him as a friend and protector. (I am writing) from my
habitual abode on Monday, 5 Tammuz—may God bring it to a most favorable conclusion for you and make known to you
the blessing of all the months that follow—in a state of well-being occasioned by your own good circumstances, praise be to God alone. Your letter has arrived. I learned
many things from it that caused me joy because of the fine state of your well-being and good health, may God, in his mercy, preserve these for you. You mentioned that you kindly
wrote to Raʾs Baradānī concerning the purchase of wheat. I would ask you to please write once again and stress the matter. For I cannot
count on anybody except God and you to assure its arrival. I have ordered the mats to be made; I have been run­ning back and forth every day to check that
they will be delivered. As for the qafar, I have already packed it in the basket. The chest has arrived with Ibn al-ʿUjaylī. However, we have been unable
to sell any­thing since the departure of al-Kohen. On this very day, a barge (khanzīra) arrived carrying
a man called Ibn Benaya who was the messenger of the first ships (?) and he brought letters with him from
the boat. From these let­ters and from the information of the passengers on the barge (khanzīra), it has been confirmed that (the ships) Ibn Liskandar, Ibn
Labad, al-Qāḍī Bū Ṭalab, al-Mufaḍḍal, the vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, the vessel at-Tarjama, and (the vessel) al-Jilānī passed safely into the open seas.
The barge (khanzīra) entered (the port) together with the ship of our lord the wazīr. The vessel (qārib) al-Ghazzal was sighted at Sūhat (?) Barqa; at
Khirasat al-Qāḍī (the ships) of Ṣadaqa b. al-Ṣafadī, Ibn Rahmūn and Ibn al-ʿŪdī (were sighted); at Raʾs Tīnī (the ships) Ṣabī b. Shablūn and Ibn al-Zaffa; at Shaqqat al-Waʿr (the rocky crevice), to west of Tobruk (the ships) al-Lakkī, al-Murṣī, and Ibn
Shabīh. The second vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, Ibn Shabanī, ʿAbbās al-Nasham, the vessel al-Faʾr and of Ibn Abū l-
Qashad (were sighted) at al-Malḥa. I have informed you of this, may God facilitate their safe arrival. There arrived for you and Marwān and a man took them.
My lord, by God, by God, please draw up the account

and send him the balance without delay. In your letter you mentioned the death of Rabbi Ḥanya the maternal uncle of my lord the physician.
May God have mercy on him and avert this fate from you. Similarly, may God have mercy on the brother-in-law of our lord the ḥaver.

I am unable to describe to you my own distress and that of our colleagues at the events that took place in the synagogue of Ashmūn. There is nothing to be done about it.


I do not know what I can say about it except "Blessed be the righteous judge." I send to you my best regards and regards to al-Kohen.

Abū l-Hajjāj sends his best greetings to all of you and urges that you sell the hides for whatever price
God will provide. Please do not postpone doing this, for he relies upon God and upon your kindness to see to the sale (of the hides). 
Also, make an effort to sell the cloak made of rough cloak and purchase for him a bag of flour with your own money, and do not necessarily wait until
you have sold some of his goods. It is imperative that you buy this bag of flour for him and your next letter should confirm the fact that it has been purchased.
I, your devoted friend, Yūsuf b. Faraḥ, send you my best regards and I inform you that Yaʿqūb has already arrived here. He mentioned that
he has purchased the flour and that it is now in Fuwwa. He experienced great difficulty with Ibn Anqab and his sister
on this one occasion. I am very perplexed by this occurrence, for he (i.e., Ibn Anqab) has closed his stall. If he arrives in Fustat, please stress to him (the importance of sending on the flour).
A khīṭī vessel set sail from here carrying some Sicilians who hope to catch up to the ship. I have entrusted them with
various letters. I sent along the letters of Mūsā to my lord Abū l-Faḍl your maternal uncle. You mentioned, my lord, that you will send
the let­ters destined for my lord the elder Abū l-Faḍl with a certain man. I hope that they will reach me, for by God I am anxiously waiting for them.
Please, kindly inform me concerning the condition of Mūsā and whether he has resumed his activities in the stall with my lord. I hope
that God will keep you in a good state. 

Verso, right margin

I am concerned about his state,
may God see to his well-being. Please convey condolences
to my lord the physician in my name.

Verso, top margin

It is inevitable that I will reach my son, and Abū l-Aslam’s eyes will be filled with joy. I miss him.

Verso, address

To my lord and master Abū Yaḥyā Nahrāy b. Nissim,
may God lengthen his life and preserve his wellbeing
From Mardūk b. Mūsā.
