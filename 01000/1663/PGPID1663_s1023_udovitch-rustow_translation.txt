My lord and master, may God lengthen his existence and preserve his benefaction, and may He act for him and with him as a friend and protector. (I am writing) from my
habitual abode on Monday, 5 Tammuz—may God bring it to a most favorable conclusion for you and make known to you
the blessing of all the months that follow—in a state of well-being occasioned by your own good circumstances, praise be to God alone. Your letter has arrived. I learned
many things from it that caused me joy because of the fine state of your well-being and good health, may God, in his mercy, preserve these for you. You mentioned that you kindly
wrote to Raʾs Baradānī concerning the purchase of wheat. I would ask you to please write once again and stress the matter. For I cannot
count on anybody except God and you to assure its arrival. I have ordered the mats to be made; I have been run­ning back and forth every day to check that
they will be delivered. As for the qafar, I have already packed it in the basket. The chest has arrived with Ibn al-ʿUjaylī. However, we have been unable
to sell any­thing since the departure of al-Kohen. On this very day, a barge (khanzīra) arrived carrying
a man called Ibn Benaya who was the messenger of the first ships (?) and he brought letters with him from
the boat. From these let­ters and from the information of the passengers on the barge (khanzīra), it has been confirmed that (the ships) Ibn Liskandar, Ibn
Labad, al-Qāḍī Bū Ṭalab, al-Mufaḍḍal, the vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, the vessel at-Tarjama, and (the vessel) al-Jilānī passed safely into the open seas.
The barge (khanzīra) entered (the port) together with the ship of our lord the wazīr. The vessel (qārib) al-Ghazzal was sighted at Sūhat (?) Barqa; at
Khirasat al-Qāḍī (the ships) of Ṣadaqa b. al-Ṣafadī, Ibn Rahmūn and Ibn al-ʿŪdī (were sighted); at Raʾs Tīnī (the ships) Ṣabī b. Shablūn and Ibn al-Zaffa; at Shaqqat al-Waʿr (the rocky crevice), to west of Tobruk (the ships) al-Lakkī, al-Murṣī, and Ibn
Shabīh. The second vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, Ibn Shabanī, ʿAbbās al-Nasham, the vessel al-Faʾr and of Ibn Abū l-
Qashad (were sighted) at al-Malḥa. I have informed you of this, and may God facilitate their safe arrival.

The 2 (objects (?)) arrived, and Marwan took them.  A man Please take care of this matter immediately, and stress the importance of drawing up the account and send him the balance without delay.    
In your letter you mentioned the death of Rabbi Hanya the maternal uncle of our lord, At-Tabib.  May God have mercy on him and avert this fate from you.  Similarly, may God have mercy on the brother-in-law of our lord the haver.1
I am unable to describe to you my own distress and that of our colleagues at the events which took place in the synagogue of Ashmun.  We are helpless in the face of it, and I do not know what I can say except: "Blessed be the righteous judge."
I send to you my best regards and regards to Al-Kohen.  Abu al-Hajjaj sends his best greetings to all of you and urges that you sell the hides for whatever price God will provide.  Please do not postpone doing this, for he relies upon God and upon your kindness to see to the sale (of the hides).  Also, make an effort to sell the cloak made of rough cloak and purchase for him a bag of flour with your own money, and do not necessarily wait until you have sold some of his goods.  It is imperative that you buy this bag of flour for him and your next letter should confirm the fact that it has been purchased.
I, your devoted friend, Yusuf b. Farah, send you my best regards and I inform you that Yaxgub has already arrived here. He mentioned that he has purchased the flour and that it is now in Fuwwa.  He experienced great difficulty with Ibn Anqab (?) and his sister on this one occasion.  I am very perplexed by this occurrence, for he (i.e. Ibn Anqab) has closed his stall.  If he (alternate interpretation): you mentioned the death of Rabbi Hanya, your maternal uncle, the doctor.  May God have mercy upon him and also on your brother-in-law, the haver.
should come to Fustat, please stress to him (the importance of sending on the flour).
A khiti vessel set sail from here carrying some Sicilians who hope to catch up to the ship.  I have entrusted them with various letters.  I sent along the letters of Musa to my lord Abu al-Fadl your maternal uncle.  You mentioned that you will send the let­ters destined for Abu al-Fadl with a certain man.  I hope that they will reach me, for I am anxiously waiting for their arrival.
Please, kindly inform me concerning the condition of Musa and whether he has resumed his activities in the stall (dukkan) with you. [I hope            (?)] that your collaboration and activities
remain in a good state.  I am concerned about him, may God see to his well-being.  Please convey condolences to him in my name on the death of At-Tabib.
