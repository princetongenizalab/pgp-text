<li>My lord and master, may God lengthen his existence and preserve his benefaction, and may He act for him and with him as a friend and protector. (I am writing) from my</li>
<li>habitual abode on Monday, 5 Tammuz&mdash;may God bring it to a most favorable conclusion for you and make known to you</li>
<li>the blessing of all the months that follow&mdash;in a state of well-being occasioned by your own good circumstances, praise be to God alone. Your letter has arrived.&nbsp;I learned</li>
<li>many things from it that caused me joy because of the fine state of your well-being and good health, may God, in his mercy, preserve these for you. You mentioned that you kindly</li>
<li>wrote to Raʾs Baradānī concerning the purchase of wheat. I would ask you to please write once again and stress the matter.&nbsp;For I cannot</li>
<li>count on anybody except God and you to assure its arrival. I have ordered the mats to be made; I have been run&shy;ning back and forth every day to check that</li>
<li>they will be delivered. As for the qafar, I have already packed it in the basket. The chest has arrived with Ibn al-<sup>ʿ</sup>Ujaylī. However, we have been unable</li>
<li>to sell any&shy;thing since the departure of al-Kohen.&nbsp;On this very day, a barge (khanzīra) arrived carrying</li>
<li>a man called Ibn Benaya who was the messenger of the first ships (?) and he brought letters with him from</li>
<li>the boat. From these let&shy;ters and from the information of the passengers on the barge (khanzīra), it has been confirmed that (the ships) Ibn Liskandar, Ibn</li>
<li>Labad, al-Qāḍī Bū Ṭalab, al-Mufaḍḍal, the vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, the vessel at-Tarjama, and (the vessel) al-Jilānī passed safely into the open seas.</li>
<li>The barge (khanzīra) entered (the port) together with the ship of our lord the wazīr. The vessel (qārib) al-Ghazzal was sighted at Sūhat (?) Barqa; at</li>
<li>Khirasat al-Qāḍī (the ships) of Ṣadaqa b. al-Ṣafadī, Ibn Rahmūn and Ibn al-ʿŪdī (were sighted); at Raʾs&nbsp;Tīnī (the ships) Ṣabī b. Shablūn and Ibn al-Zaffa; at Shaqqat al-Waʿr (the rocky crevice), to west of Tobruk (the ships) al-Lakkī, al-Murṣī, and Ibn</li>
<li>Shabīh. The second vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, Ibn Shabanī, ʿAbbās al-Nasham, the vessel al-Faʾr and of Ibn Abū l-</li>
<li>Qashad (were sighted) at al-Malḥa. I have informed you of this, may God facilitate their safe arrival. There arrived for you and Marwān and a man took them.</li>
<li>My lord, by God, by God, please draw up the account</li>
