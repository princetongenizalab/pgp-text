<li>My lord and master, may God lengthen his existence and preserve his benefaction, and may He act for him and with him as a friend and protector. (I am writing) from my</li>
<li>habitual abode on Monday, 5 Tammuz&mdash;may God bring it to a most favorable conclusion for you and make known to you</li>
<li>the blessing of all the months that follow&mdash;in a state of well-being occasioned by your own good circumstances, praise be to God alone. Your letter has arrived.&nbsp;I learned</li>
<li>many things from it that caused me joy because of the fine state of your well-being and good health, may God, in his mercy, preserve these for you. You mentioned that you kindly</li>
<li>wrote to Raʾs Baradānī concerning the purchase of wheat. I would ask you to please write once again and stress the matter.&nbsp;For I cannot</li>
<li>count on anybody except God and you to assure its arrival. I have ordered the mats to be made; I have been run&shy;ning back and forth every day to check that</li>
<li>they will be delivered. As for the qafar, I have already packed it in the basket. The chest has arrived with Ibn al-<sup>ʿ</sup>Ujaylī. However, we have been unable</li>
<li>to sell any&shy;thing since the departure of al-Kohen.&nbsp;On this very day, a barge (khanzīra) arrived carrying</li>
<li>a man called Ibn Benaya who was the messenger of the first ships (?) and he brought letters with him from</li>
<li>the boat. From these let&shy;ters and from the information of the passengers on the barge (khanzīra), it has been confirmed that (the ships) Ibn Liskandar, Ibn</li>
<li>Labad, al-Qāḍī Bū Ṭalab, al-Mufaḍḍal, the vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, the vessel at-Tarjama, and (the vessel) al-Jilānī passed safely into the open seas.</li>
<li>The barge (khanzīra) entered (the port) together with the ship of our lord the wazīr. The vessel (qārib) al-Ghazzal was sighted at Sūhat (?) Barqa; at</li>
<li>Khirasat al-Qāḍī (the ships) of Ṣadaqa b. al-Ṣafadī, Ibn Rahmūn and Ibn al-ʿŪdī (were sighted); at Raʾs&nbsp;Tīnī (the ships) Ṣabī b. Shablūn and Ibn al-Zaffa; at Shaqqat al-Waʿr (the rocky crevice), to west of Tobruk (the ships) al-Lakkī, al-Murṣī, and Ibn</li>
<li>Shabīh. The second vessel of Ibn Madhkūr, Ibn Shabanī, ʿAbbās al-Nasham, the vessel al-Faʾr and of Ibn Abū l-</li>
<li>Qashad (were sighted) at al-Malḥa. I have informed you of this, and may God facilitate their safe arrival.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 2 (objects (?)) arrived, and Marwan took them.&nbsp; A man Please take care of this matter immediately, and stress the importance of drawing up the account and send him the balance without delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your letter you mentioned the death of Rabbi Hanya the maternal uncle of our lord, At-Tabib.&nbsp; May God have mercy on him and avert this fate from you.&nbsp; Similarly, may God have mercy on the brother-in-law of our lord the haver.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>I am unable to describe to you my own distress and that of our colleagues at the events which took place in the synagogue of Ashmun.&nbsp; We are helpless in the face of it, and I do not know what I can say except: "Blessed be the righteous judge."</p>
<p>I send to you my best regards and regards to Al-Kohen.&nbsp; Abu al-Hajjaj sends his best greetings to all of you and urges that you sell the hides for whatever price God will provide.&nbsp; Please do not postpone doing this, for he relies upon God and upon your kindness to see to the sale (of the hides).&nbsp; Also, make an effort to sell the cloak made of rough cloak and purchase for him a bag of flour with your own money, and do not necessarily wait until you have sold some of his goods.&nbsp; It is imperative that you buy this bag of flour for him and your next letter should confirm the fact that it has been purchased.</p>
<p>I, your devoted friend, Yusuf b. Farah, send you my best regards and I inform you that Ya<sup>x</sup>gub has already arrived here. He mentioned that he has purchased the flour and that it is now in Fuwwa.&nbsp; He experienced great difficulty with Ibn Anqab (?) and his sister on this one occasion.&nbsp; I am very perplexed by this occurrence, for he (i.e. Ibn Anqab) has closed his stall.&nbsp; If he (alternate interpretation): you mentioned the death of Rabbi Hanya, your maternal uncle, the doctor.&nbsp; May God have mercy upon him and also on your brother-in-law, the haver.</p>
<p>should come to Fustat, please stress to him (the importance of sending on the flour).</p>
<p>A khiti vessel set sail from here carrying some Sicilians who hope to catch up to the ship.&nbsp; I have entrusted them with various letters.&nbsp; I sent along the letters of Musa to my lord Abu al-Fadl your maternal uncle.&nbsp; You mentioned that you will send the let&shy;ters destined for Abu al-Fadl with a certain man.&nbsp; I hope that they will reach me, for I am anxiously waiting for their arrival.</p>
<p>Please, kindly inform me concerning the condition of Musa and whether he has resumed his activities in the stall (dukkan) with you. [I hope&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (?)] that your collaboration and activities</p>
<p>remain in a good state.&nbsp; I am concerned about him, may God see to his well-being.&nbsp; Please convey condolences to him in my name on the death of At-Tabib.</p>
<p>ADDRESS</p>
<p>To my lord and master Abu Yahya Nahray b. Nissim May God lengthen</p>
<p>his life and preserve his well-being</p>
<p>From Marduk b. Musa.</p>
