<p>This was in the presence of the Muqaddam (his) ho(nor), gr(eat- ness), (and) ho(liness), (our) ma(ster) and t(eacher) Elijah the Kohen, President of the academy of Geon [Jacob.. who was] at that time in Ascalon, and that [. . . ]</p>

<p>a deed of manumission and he wrote it. And there was no child with her; afterwards she bore [him a daughter. . . ]</p>

<p>named Milāḥ. They were then asked, "Do you have combined testimony as to how much time passed between [her] marriage [and the birth of the girl,]</p>

<p>so that she would have been conceived and born in sanctity?" They said, "[W]e were not told [..., but we declare(?)]</p>

<p>And with this, she ordered us to write a court record concerning this for him to be in [his] hand [as evidence. . . for marriage by]</p>

<p>qiddushin and by marriage contract (kethubbā) in Israel. We wrote and signed on the second day of the week, [thi]rteen[th day of the month]</p>
