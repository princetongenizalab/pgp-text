Recto 

In the name of God, the Merciful
I am writing – May God prolong the permanence of my master, the splendid elder, and perpetuate his glory, his support , his happiness
and his benefaction –  to inform [you] that since the time you left us, I have had not
 a little trouble on account of the jālah [i.e. jāliya]. In town, few of my acquaintances are going through 
what I have gone through. Every day I am dragged [to prison]. They summon me and tell me to pay the entire jāliya. They want to 
register me as they would you [i.e. as a local]. But you know that my father was only a newcomer. Whatever they take
from me, they credit to another group [in the register] and exempt them from the offence [of tax delinquency]. They are a group
whose nature is not unknown to you. The favour that was done on my behalf due to your intervention
brought my payment this year almost 2 dinars, as I informed you.
My heart would be soothed if others were treated the way I was treated. The hushshār and the collector of the jāliya  
have nothing to do with this. This is entirely the work of the Jews, may God recompense them

 their souls and their children. 
I informed you of that. I prayed for 
your wellbeing and for that of
your son.
I congratulate you on the arrival
of the little girl – may God

grant you the happiness of Abū Saʿd (?).
Peace.

[To] my master the elder Abū Yaḥyā Nahray ibn Nissim,
 
May God prolong his permanence and perpetuate his happiness
[From] the one thankful for his favour, Abū al-Khayr ibn ʿAwwaḍ
