<li>In the name of God, the Merciful</li>
<li>I am writing &ndash; May God prolong the permanence of my master, the splendid elder, and perpetuate his glory, his support , his happiness</li>
<li>and his benefaction &ndash;&nbsp; to inform [you] that since the time you left us, I have had not</li>
<li>&nbsp;a little trouble on account of the jālah [i.e. jāliya]. In town, few of my acquaintances are going through&nbsp;</li>
<li>what I have gone through. Every day I am dragged [to prison]. They summon me and tell me to pay the entire jāliya. They want to&nbsp;</li>
<li>register me as they would you [i.e. as a local]. But you know that my father was only a newcomer. Whatever they take</li>
<li>from me, they credit to another group [in the register] and exempt them from the offence [of tax delinquency]. They are a group</li>
<li>whose nature is not unknown to you. The favour that was done on my behalf due to your intervention</li>
<li>brought my payment this year almost 2 dinars, as I informed you.</li>
<li>My heart would be soothed if others were treated the way I was treated. The hushshār and the collector of the jāliya&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>have nothing to do with this. This is entirely the work of the Jews, may God recompense them</li>
