                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <p>I inform my lord, the Kohen, may God, the exalted, give him success, that Mūsā, after some days of absence, entered the school while a boy was reading before me. I said to him: Take the par[āshā and read it a few times] until the boy will have finished. But Mūsā swore by God, the exalted, that he would read a verse only once. Said I to him: "Read it twice." Instead he left me and went out of the house. I shouted after him, but he did not agree to return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if he does not read four five times he will not remember a thing. Please take notice of this and kindly instruct him accordingly. And peace over you and praise be to God.&nbsp;</p>
