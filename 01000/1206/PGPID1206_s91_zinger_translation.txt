Recto


On Monday, 24 Tishrei (1)364 AG (= 21 September 1052 CE), R. Joseph b. R. Ṣedaqa 


the keeper of a grain store and his divorcee Gh[aniyya] bt. R. Ḥasan came before the court. We made the symbolic purchase from him according to his will and desire 


without coercion that he will pay four dirhams every week to R. Salāma the seller of olive oil in Cairo 


to be spent on the maintenance of his son Ibrahīm whose 


age is now five years. This Ibrahīm will stay 


with his mother, Ghaniyya. If Joseph would like to visit him on Saturday or 


during the week, he (i.e. Joseph) will take him (i.e. Ibrahīm) on the condition that he will return him to her. 


After we verified her identity, we made the symbolic purchase from Ghaniyya for a complete release of R. Joseph 


from her ketubah and from any suspicion and claim. She will not harass him, nor sue him 


in Muslim courts, nor bring him before the government. We made it clear to her 


that if she were to break (this agreement) she will be banned with her name and ostracised. 


Then both of them cancelled any prior notification. We have written (this) so it will be (a testimony) of right. 


Ṣedaqa b. Menaḥem, m(ay his) s(oul rest in peace).
