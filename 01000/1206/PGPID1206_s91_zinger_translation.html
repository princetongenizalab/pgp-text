<li>
<p>On Monday, 24 Tishrei (1)364 AG (= 21 September 1052 CE), R. Joseph b. R. Ṣedaqa&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the keeper of a grain store and his divorcee Gh[aniyya] bt. R. Ḥasan came before the court. We made the symbolic purchase from him according to his will and desire&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>without coercion that he will pay four dirhams every week to R. Salāma the seller of olive oil in Cairo&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be spent on the maintenance of his son Ibrahīm whose&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>age is now five years. This Ibrahīm will stay&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with his mother, Ghaniyya. If Joseph would like to visit him on Saturday or&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>during the week, he (i.e. Joseph) will take him (i.e. Ibrahīm) on the condition that he will return him to her.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After we verified her identity, we made the symbolic purchase from Ghaniyya for a complete release of R. Joseph&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from her ketubah and from any suspicion and claim. She will not harass him, nor sue him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Muslim courts, nor bring him before the government. We made it clear to her&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that if she were to break (this agreement) she will be banned with her name and ostracised.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then both of them cancelled any prior notification. We have written (this) so it will be (a testimony) of right.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ṣedaqa b. Menaḥem, m(ay his) s(oul rest in peace).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
