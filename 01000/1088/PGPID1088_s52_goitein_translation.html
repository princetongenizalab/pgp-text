</li>
<li>
<p>about t]ravel by sea. I had indeed awaited the arrival of a ship,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>either the Fakhrī or the Gaetani. However God decreed that they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.... . . did not attack (?) Spain but Bougie and even set sail for Barrāniyya (?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.. .. . .. . my money, as I was unable to travel this&nbsp;</p>

<p>year. Then after God had caused] them that disaster, they went back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and I was forced to go to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am unable to come this year out of fear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they have become very strong and tried</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they had twenty seven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shi]ps, but were defeated. However, I am afraid that they will build</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>many] ships and start war again this year. On the otherhand, I see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you still have] means to keep you going till I come to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if God wills. Furthermore I sent you with Abū s-Surūr b. Shūʿa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Abū l-Ḥa]san, the agent of our lord, may his glory be exalted, six baskets of collyrium.</p>
