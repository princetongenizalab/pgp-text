Recto


. . . between the Mus]lims and the Rūm. Nobody dared to talk any more


about t]ravel by sea. I had indeed awaited the arrival of a ship,


either the Fakhrī or the Gaetani. However God decreed that they


.... . . did not attack (?) Spain but Bougie and even set sail for Barrāniyya (?)


.. .. . .. . my money, as I was unable to travel this 


year. Then after God had caused] them that disaster, they went back


and I was forced to go to


I am unable to come this year out of fear


they have become very strong and tried


they had twenty seven


shi]ps, but were defeated. However, I am afraid that they will build


many] ships and start war again this year. On the otherhand, I see


that you still have] means to keep you going till I come to you


if God wills. Furthermore I sent you with Abū s-Surūr b. Shūʿa


and Abū l-Ḥa]san, the agent of our lord, may his glory be exalted, six baskets of collyrium.
