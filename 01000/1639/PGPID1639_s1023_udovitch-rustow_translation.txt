Recto

In your name.
I am writing — may God lengthen the life of my lord the elder and preserve his wellbeing, happiness and benefactions — from Alexandria,
with four days remaining in the month of Tevet — may God conclude it for us and for you in the most favorable manner. All is well and in good order, praise be
to God, lord of the universe. Your letter arrived, carried by Faraj the courier (fayj). I learned from it about the state of your wellbeing, and I was delighted about it.
My lord mentioned the situation with respect to the promissory note (khaṭṭ) to your credit from the preceding year which is in the account book (daftar al-ḥisāb). I have searched through the letters
and account books (dafātir) that I have taken and found in them that there remains a balance in my favor after having deducted the fourteen and a half
dinars and half-qirāṭ that I spent. The details of the latter sum are as follows: one-half, one-quarter and one-eighth (dinars) from the shoes you sent as a gift with Maymūn;
then there were the 4 dinars; then there was the remainder owed to Ibn al-ʿAshʿāq, which came to two-thirds dinar; then there was the reduction (dis­count) in the price of the rubāʿīs (quarter dinars) belonging to Falāḥ, which came to two dinars
and one-sixth; and the price of the dirhams, which came to one dinar and one-sixth. All of these items amount to a total of 14 and one-half dinars and one-half of a qirāṭ.
According to the information in your promissory note (khaṭṭ), there remains a balance in my favor of 120⅓ dinars. My lord, we have no need of this latest account of yours, and I have not sought it 
from you. This is an old account. However, would you please, my lord, in accordance with your customary kindness, extract the balance
pertaining to the current year, including the entire sum that has accumulated with you to my credit after you have com­puted all the transactions. This should come to 310 dinars.
The details of this sum are as follows: A credit of 120⅓ dinars carried over from the previous account; the price of the good dirhams belonging to Maymūn b. Yaʿqūb, which came to 7⅛ dinars;
and from the 80 dinars less two qirāṭ that I left with you after my return from the Shām,
there accrues 28⅙ dinars; and from the 20 Rūmī dinars and 8 qirāṭ, there accrues 16⅙ dinars; and from the large
purse, 115 dinars and one qirāṭ; and from the 32 Rūmī dinars and two qirāṭs, there accrues 27⅛ dinar. All this
adds up to 310 dinars. The following is a detailed breakdown of what you have expended on my behalf: For Ḥasan (?) al-Andalusi, one rubāʿī; for Hārūn
b. ʿAmmār, 13 dinars; the sum paid to al-Kohen at the Dār al-Baraka, one dinar; the price of a bale of pepper and its expenses,
145 dinars and 5½ qirāṭ; for a sack of flour and its shipment, 2⅝ dinars; in the possession of Tayyib, 50 dinars; 
from Ibn Ṣarrāf, two payments; and what I owe you, 16 dinars, which includes the amount I collected from Abū Ghālib, since after I settled accounts with him,
he paid me 1¼ dinar, since when he asked you for it, they sent ½ dinar of the 12 dinars back to ʿAllush the beadle.
Your share of the indigo was 20 dinars. All of this comes to: 249 dinars and 2½ qirats. The balance in my favor
is 60⅞ and ½ qirat. My lord mentioned that he realized 4 dinars and 2½ qirats from the sale of the coral,
and that 50 dinars arrived for Ḥassūn b. Mūsā b. Isḥaq. If you see fit, please inform me how much
of these my lord Abū ʿAlī Ḥassūn b. Isḥaq took. You did not mention the price of the wrap (mayzar). I swear by God, my lord,
I would not have searched through the letters and extracted the information in this letter were it not for your statement in your preceding letter saying: "Check
whether you owe me 17 dinars without the price of the wrap." Since you pointed it out to me, and Abū ʿAlī Ḥassūn wanted it, 
therefore I would like you to inform me how much he collected from you so that I can add it (to the account). If it is necessary for me to ... [          ] I will
reply to your letter and keep you informed about it. The account is his account, which I have sent with [          ] and to Ibn
Faraḥ. I would like you to take good care of it until I can check what I owe him, so that I can pay him.
God knows how I exert myself [       ]
[        ] Ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ. You mentioned this, my lord, in your conversation [ ] that he wrote in
this concerning our teacher Kathīr, may God grant him life. I would like you to [     ] in your generosity with respect to this transaction [ ] .
My lord, may there be removed from me the harshness of life and loneliness.
