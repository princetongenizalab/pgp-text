                        <ol>
<li>In your name.</li>
<li>I am writing &mdash; may God lengthen the life of my lord the elder and preserve his wellbeing, happiness and benefactions &mdash;&nbsp;from Alexandria,</li>
<li>with four days remaining in the month of Tevet &mdash; may God conclude it for us and for you in the most favorable manner.&nbsp;All is well and in good order, praise be</li>
<li>to God, lord of the universe. Your letter arrived, carried by Faraj the courier (fayj). I learned from it about the state of your wellbeing, and I was delighted about it.</li>
<li>My lord mentioned the situation with respect to the promissory note (khaṭṭ) to your credit from the preceding year which is in the account book (daftar al-ḥisāb).&nbsp;I have searched through the letters</li>
<li>and account books (dafātir) that I have taken and found in them that there remains a balance in my favor after having deducted the fourteen and a half</li>
<li>dinars and half-qirāṭ that I spent. The details of the latter sum are as follows: one-half, one-quarter and one-eighth (dinars) from the shoes you sent as a gift with Maymūn;</li>
<li>then there were the 4 dinars; then there was the remainder owed to Ibn al-<sup>ʿ</sup>Ashʿāq, which came to two-thirds dinar; then there was the reduction (dis&shy;count) in the price of the rubāʿīs (quarter dinars) belonging to Falāḥ, which came to two dinars</li>
<li>and one-sixth; and the price of the dirhams, which came to one dinar and one-sixth.&nbsp;All of these items amount to a total of 14 and one-half dinars and one-half of a qirāṭ.</li>
<li>According to the information in your promissory note (khaṭṭ), there remains a balance in my favor of 120⅓ dinars. My lord, we have no need of this latest account of yours, and I have not sought it&nbsp;</li>
<li>from you. This is an old account. However, would you please, my lord, in accordance with your customary kindness, extract the balance</li>
<li>pertaining to the current year, including the entire sum that has accumulated with you to my credit after you have com&shy;puted all the transactions. This should come to 310 dinars.</li>
<li>The details of this sum are as follows: A credit of 120⅓ dinars carried over from the previous account; the price of the good dirhams belonging to Maymūn b. Yaʿqūb, which came to 7⅛&nbsp;dinars;</li>
<li>and from the 80 dinars less two qirāṭ that I left with you after my return from the Shām,</li>
<li>there accrues&nbsp;28⅙ dinars; and from the 20 Rūmī dinars and 8 qirāṭ, there accrues 16⅙ dinars; and from the large</li>
<li>purse, 115 dinars and one qirāṭ; and from the 32 Rūmī dinars and two qirāṭs, there accrues 27⅛ dinar. All this</li>
<li>adds up to 310 dinars. The following is a detailed breakdown of what you have expended on my behalf: For Ḥasan (?) al-Andalusi, one rubāʿī; for Hārūn</li>
<li>b. ʿAmmār, 13 dinars; the sum paid to al-Kohen at the Dār al-Baraka, one dinar; the price of a bale of pepper and its expenses,</li>
<li>145 dinars and 5&frac12; qirāṭ; for a sack of flour and its shipment, 2⅝ dinars; in the possession of Tayyib, 50 dinars;&nbsp;</li>
<li>from Ibn Ṣarrāf, two payments; and what I owe you, 16 dinars,&nbsp;which includes the amount I collected from Abū Ghālib, since after I settled accounts with him,</li>
<li>he paid me 1&frac14; dinar, since when he asked you for it, they sent &frac12; dinar of the 12 dinars back to&nbsp;<sup>ʿ</sup>Allush the beadle.</li>
<li>Your share of the indigo was 20 dinars. All of this comes to: 249 dinars and 2&frac12; qirats. The balance in my favor</li>
<li>is 60⅞ and &frac12; qirat. My lord mentioned that he realized 4 dinars and 2&frac12; qirats from the sale of the coral,</li>
<li>and that 50 dinars arrived for Ḥassūn b. Mūsā b. Isḥaq. If you see fit, please inform me how much</li>
<li>of these my lord Abū&nbsp;<sup>ʿ</sup>Alī Ḥassūn b. Isḥaq took. You did not mention the price of the wrap (mayzar). I swear by God, my lord,</li>
<li>I would not have searched through the letters and extracted the information in this letter were it not for your statement in your preceding letter saying: "Check</li>
<li>whether you owe me 17 dinars without the price of the wrap." Since you pointed it out to me, and Abū ʿAlī Ḥassūn wanted it,&nbsp;</li>
<li>therefore I would like you to inform me how much he collected from you so that I can add it (to the account). If it is necessary for me to ... [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] I will</li>
<li>reply to your letter and keep you informed about it. The account is his account, which I have sent with [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] and to Ibn</li>
<li>Faraḥ. I would like you to take good care of it until I can check what I owe him, so&nbsp;that I can pay him.</li>
<li>God knows how I exert myself [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]</li>
<li>[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] Ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ. You mentioned this, my lord, in your conversation [ ] that he wrote in</li>
<li>this concerning our teacher Kathīr, may God grant him life. I would like you to [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] in your generosity with respect to this transaction [ ] .</li>
<li>My lord, may there be removed from me the harshness of life and loneliness.</li>
