                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In your name.</li>
<li>I am writing &mdash; may God lengthen the life of my lord the elder and preserve his wellbeing, happiness and benefactions &mdash;&nbsp;from Alexandria,</li>
<li>with four days remaining in the month of Tevet &mdash; may God conclude it for us and for you in the most favorable manner.&nbsp;All is well and in good order, praise be</li>
<li>to God, lord of the universe. Your letter arrived, carried by Faraj the courier (fayj). I learned from it about the state of your wellbeing, and I was delighted about it.</li>
<li>My lord mentioned the situation with respect to the promissory note (khaṭṭ) to your credit from the preceding year which is in the account book (daftar al-ḥisāb).&nbsp;I have searched through the letters</li>
<li>and account books (dafātir) that I have taken and found in them that there remains a balance in my favor after having deducted the fourteen and a half</li>
<li>dinars and half-qirāṭ that I spent. The details of the latter sum are as follows: one-half, one-quarter and one-eighth (dinars) from the shoes you sent as a gift with Maymūn;</li>
<li>then there were the 4 dinars; then there was the remainder owed to Ibn al-<sup>ʿ</sup>Ashʿāq, which came to two-thirds dinar; then there was the reduction (dis&shy;count) in the price of the rubāʿīs (quarter dinars) belonging to Falāḥ, which came to two dinars</li>
<li>and one-sixth; and the price of the dirhams, which came to one dinar and one-sixth.&nbsp;All of these items amount to a total of 14 and one-half dinars and one-half of a qirāṭ.</li>
<li>According to the information in your promissory note (khaṭṭ), there remains a balance in my favor of 120⅓ dinars. My lord, we have no need of this latest account of yours, and I have not sought it&nbsp;</li>
<li>from you. This is an old account. However, would you please, my lord, in accordance with your customary kindness, extract the balance</li>
<li>pertaining to the current year, including the entire sum that has accumulated with you to my credit after you have com&shy;puted all the transactions. This should come to 310 dinars.</li>
<li>The details of this sum are as follows: A credit of 120⅓ dinars carried over from the previous account; the price of the good dirhams belonging to Maymūn b. Yaʿqūb, which came to 7⅛&nbsp;dinars;</li>
<li>and from the 80 dinars less two qirāṭ that I left with you after my return from the Shām,</li>
<li>there accrues&nbsp;28⅙ dinars; and from the 20 Rūmī dinars and 8 qirāṭ, there accrues 16⅙ dinars; and from the large</li>
<li>purse, 115 dinars and one qirāṭ; and from the 32 Rūmī dinars and two qirāṭs, there accrues 27⅛ dinar. All this</li>
<li>adds up to 310 dinars. The following is a detailed breakdown of what you have expended on my behalf: For Ḥasan (?) al-Andalusi, one rubāʿī; for Hārūn</li>
<li>b. ʿAmmār, 13 dinars; the sum paid to al-Kohen at the Dār al-Baraka, one dinar; the price of a bale of pepper and its expenses,</li>
<li>145 dinars and 5&frac12; qirāṭ; for a sack of flour and its shipment, 2⅝ dinars; in the possession of Tayyib, 50 dinars;&nbsp;</li>
<li>from Ibn Ṣarrāf, two payments; and what I owe you, 16 dinars,&nbsp;which includes the amount I collected from Abū Ghālib, since after I settled accounts with him,</li>
<li>he paid me 1&frac14; dinar, since when he asked you for it, they sent &frac12; dinar of the 12 dinars back to&nbsp;<sup>ʿ</sup>Allush the beadle.</li>
<li>Your share of the indigo was 20 dinars. All of this comes to: 249 dinars and 2&frac12; qirats. The balance in my favor</li>
<li>is 60⅞ and &frac12; qirat. My lord mentioned that he realized 4 dinars and 2&frac12; qirats from the sale of the coral,</li>
<li>and that 50 dinars arrived for Ḥassūn b. Mūsā b. Isḥaq. If you see fit, please inform me how much</li>
<li>of these my lord Abū&nbsp;<sup>ʿ</sup>Alī Ḥassūn b. Isḥaq took. You did not mention the price of the wrap (mayzar). I swear by God, my lord,</li>
<li>I would not have searched through the letters and extracted the information in this letter were it not for your statement in your preceding letter saying: "Check</li>
<li>whether you owe me 17 dinars without the price of the wrap." Since you pointed it out to me, and Abū ʿAlī Ḥassūn wanted it,&nbsp;</li>
<li>therefore I would like you to inform me how much he collected from you so that I can add it (to the account). If it is necessary for me to ... [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] I will</li>
<li>reply to your letter and keep you informed about it. The account is his account, which I have sent with [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] and to Ibn</li>
<li>Faraḥ. I would like you to take good care of it until I can check what I owe him, so&nbsp;that I can pay him.</li>
<li>God knows how I exert myself [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]</li>
<li>[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] Ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ. You mentioned this, my lord, in your conversation [ ] that he wrote in</li>
<li>this concerning our teacher Kathīr, may God grant him life. I would like you to [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ] in your generosity with respect to this transaction [ ] .</li>
<li>My lord, may there be removed from me the harshness of life and loneliness.</li>

                        <p>1&ndash;3. My young son, may God exalt him, has been left bereft of his parent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&ndash;4. I hope that God will make known to me his blessing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5&ndash;6. I have no one who will hand me a cup of water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7&ndash;9. I am in dire need of someone to serve me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9&ndash;11. I have found no one suitable here in the Jewish quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>12&ndash;16. If you do not have a solu&shy;tion for the problem of which I informed you, send me a letter to that effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>17&ndash;18. And if there is not [&nbsp; ],</p>
<p>19&ndash;20. then please, my lord, procure a slave girl for me who is suitable for serv&shy;ice, trustworthy and concerning whose chastity people will bear witness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>21. Please take care of this for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>22&ndash;24. If you are able to do anything in this regard, let me know her price in&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>1&ndash;2. your letter.</p>
<p>3&ndash;7. It is only the fact that I am all alone that is keeping me from coming myself in the place of this letter and accompanying my lord the amir.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8&ndash;16. I have no one else who either enters or leaves the house or&nbsp;will hand the children a cup of water, nor anyone who will open the door for them except God and myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>17&ndash;18 I swear by God and by my father,</p>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>I would not have exposed my situation to you, except that it helps to relieve the harshness of my life and of what I am expe&shy;riencing. Would you please, my lord, in accordance with your customary kindness,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kiss the hands of my lord the elder Abu Sa<sup>ʿ</sup>d on my behalf. Inform him of my situation and tell him that the col&shy;leagues of my lord</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the amir have come up to see him and that I could not undertake the journey for the reasons that I have men&shy;tioned to you. If you gain entrance to my lord</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the amir and have the opportunity to speak in his presence, inform him of my cir&shy;cumstances and long-suffering, and that&nbsp;I myself would be in the place of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my letter. Were I only able to find someone with whom I could leave my children, I would certainly be in the place of&nbsp;this letter of mine. Perhaps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will find someone&nbsp;with whom to leave the children, and will be able to leave.&nbsp;The news of the movements of my lord the most exalted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>amir has just arrived. Please, by God, my lord, find out for me quickly whether my lord the elder Abu Saʿīd &mdash; may God preserve&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his glory and make permanent what he has bestowed upon him &mdash; whether there is any need for me to come up (to Fustat), and then write to me what he says to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sought guidance from God the exalted and glorious and sent a purse with the elder Abū Ṣḥaq. He will deliver it either</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Abū Ghālib the wakīl or to someone else connected with the him. It weighs 105 dinars, and there is a note in it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>containing the details connected with it. In accordance with your cus&shy;tomary kindness to me, would you please sell this bag of coins for me and, with the price you fetch for them, purchase</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars that are accepted in Alexandria or old quarter-dinars that are accepted in Alexandria. Please send them to me with whomever you see fit to do so.&nbsp; This will be a kindness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to me. I have informed you of this.&nbsp;I send you my best regards. Convey my best greetings to my master the Rav.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regards to the elder Abū Zikrī, and to my lord the elder Abū l-Fadl b. al-Sukkarī.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My best greetings to my lords, your brothers-in-law, each in his own name.&nbsp;Also convey my best regards to Abū Yūsuf Ya<sup>ʿ</sup>qūb,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and tell him that he did not write me the size of the mats that he mentioned to me.&nbsp; I do not know what he has in mind, nor their</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>measurements. Let him send me the type and inform me of the length and width he desires so that I can purchase them for him.&nbsp;I sent you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a glass jar of minced salt-fish made in Alexandria. I sent the copy (of the book) to my brother-in-law Hārūn and told him to transport it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to you together with my cloak. I will make every effort to send them. If I find someone with whom to send them or, if someone is travelling</p>
</li>

                        <p>1&ndash; 4. from Fustat to here and then returning, I will send them with him.</p>
<p>4&ndash;6. If there is anything you need done, please honor me by requesting it from me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7&ndash;10. Perhaps my lord Abū ʿImrān Mūsā b. Abī al-Ḥayy will send them to you in the Rīf.</p>
<p>11&ndash;14. When the dirhams arrive, I will do with them as you instructed in your letter.</p>
