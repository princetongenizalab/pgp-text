<li>May abundant greetings / and scented blessing /</li>
<li>and double consolation / and fulfillment of every request /</li>
<li>be bestowed upon our precious master and teacher Abraham ha-Kohen</li>
<li>the precious, may your Rock protect you and be your succor,</li>
<li>son of our teacher Joseph, (who) r(ests) in (the Garden of) E(den). We request</li>
<li>from your honor, our precious one, to act</li>
<li>on our behalf in keeping with your habit with</li>
<li>scholars and members of the Sanhedrin (the yeshiva), for we have</li>
<li>the burden of a wife [and] children. We have just made the&nbsp;extremely laborious journey</li>
<li>from Jerusalem to Fustat.</li>
<li>May our Rock consider what you do</li>
<li>for us as if it were a complete offering and a basket</li>
<li>of first fruits, and may he double your reward. May He</li>
<li>in His mercy so do and fulfill, and may the outcome be (your) welfare.&nbsp;</li>
