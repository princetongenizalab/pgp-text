Recto

May abundant greetings / and scented blessing /
and double consolation / and fulfillment of every request /
be bestowed upon our precious master and teacher Abraham ha-Kohen
the precious, may your Rock protect you and be your succor,
son of our teacher Joseph, (who) r(ests) in (the Garden of) E(den). We request
from your honor, our precious one, to act
on our behalf in keeping with your habit with
scholars and members of the Sanhedrin (the yeshiva), for we have
the burden of a wife [and] children. We have just made the extremely laborious journey
from Jerusalem to Fustat.
May our Rock consider what you do
for us as if it were a complete offering and a basket
of first fruits, and may he double your reward. May He
in His mercy so do and fulfill, and may the outcome be (your) welfare. 


(Signature:) descendant of Yeshuʿa the ḥaver son of Ṣedaqa, (who) r(ests) in E(den).
