                        <ol>
<li>In your name, O Merciful One.</li>
<li>
<p>‘Great peace have those that love your Law; nothing can make them stumble’ (Pss 119:165).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good greetings from the good Lord who, from his goodness, spreads good upon the world and blessings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>like rivers. May all of them whirl about the head of the honourable,  great, holy, our master and teacher Aaron the Ḥaver</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and all who are connected with him. May they accept greetings from me and from the people around me, from my friends [and from]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my relatives. May our God also bring together the scattered people of Judah and Israel, to lead them up to the temple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of His holiness, ‘to gaze upon the delightfulness of the Lord and to contemplate His temple’ (Pss 27:4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept greetings from me, Sa‘d, and I am letting you know that my  soul longs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to see your face and to gaze upon your honour. May the Holy One, blessed be He, not […]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the yoke prevents me from going to you. And the Lord, blessed be He, tests hearts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May the Holy One, blessed be He, let me soon look upon your face.  […]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would not have ceased my constant writing to you except we heard  that [you had been killed by]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the enemy. And I was sad about this news. But subsequently I have  heard that you are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alive [and so] I have written this letter. I implore you to reply to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and let me know what you are up to and whether you have any needs  and how you are. And I</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the members of my household are well: my heart is free from all  cares except that caused by your distance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from me. And I am informing you that your wife suffers great distress  with your children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ve abandoned [them] these past twenty-three years and have  shown no desire to see them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you act in this way towards your wife and your sons? You  should consider what to do about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your children. You said: ‘Inform me about the water’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nile has already flooded and is at peace. As for the [price of] bread: twelve pounds for a silver [dirham]. And a garden of the Lord is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the land of Egypt. And you said that you were ill. The Lord, blessed be He, grant you a complete recovery and […]</p>
