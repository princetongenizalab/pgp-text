                        <ol>
<li>‘May goodness come’ (Job 22:21) to you and yours and to all the members of your household, [a goodness] ‘that widens and turns ever upward’  (Ezek 41:7). My friend  </li>
<li>who is like my soul, our master and teacher Yefet the Teacher – may  you be established in the land and be at ease from dread of evil.</li>
<li>‘I thought that I would uncover your ear’ (Ruth 4:4) with all that has  happened this last week that I have been travelling. On the fourth day of  the week  </li>
<li>my ship set sail from Maks (al-Maqs) and on the fifth day we arrived  safely at the town of Minyat Ziftā.  </li>
<li>All our spirits were high, there having been no storms at sea ‘and no  lack of anything’ (Judg 18:7). However, I found a world turned upside  down.  </li>
<li>The men of the place are hunted by the tax officials, who lay snares for  them like birds  </li>
<li>caught in a trap. And I am entangled in the land, ‘until the Lord from  Heaven looks down and sees’ (Lam 3:50). Now, ‘hear my voice</li>
<li>in your kindness’ (Pss 119:149). Turn your ear to the words of my  mouth. Ask after the welfare of my household. And what should you say  to them  </li>
<li>but that I am sick with love for them, and ‘after I spoke they did not  speak again’ (Job 29:22). And deal gently for my sake with the young man Elyaqim; lead him on  </li>
<li>slowly in his reading and accustom him to reading from all four sides,  from above  </li>
<li>and below, as I desire. Do not let him idle away his time with other  boys. Accustom him to say  </li>
<li>the blessings that he knows and tell his mother to wash his hands and  to say the ha-Moci’ blessing and the blessing  </li>
<li>over wine, water and washing, in which we have instructed him, in his  own way. And warn them to beware of  </li>
<li>letting my youngest son toddle about in the courtyard, ‘in case harm  should befall him’ (Gen 42:4) because of the winter and the cold</li>
<li>of the season, and in case a brick should fall off the roof onto him. For  they are precious to me and are my darling children. And even though</li>
<li>we are poor, the Lord’s hand is not too short to save us. And as for the  money I borrowed from that poor man, </li>
<li>lead me on in your kindness until I come back to our land. And if you  see that he is in a hurry to leave, then  </li>
<li>I requested Shaykh Ismā‘īl al-Vūlā+ūli to make me a loan and he gladly agreed.  </li>
<li>So take from him the amount of the debt and give it to [the creditor]. I  know that there will be a bit of a scramble at the distribution to the poor of bread  </li>
<li>and olives (?), but if you can, your care will make me great. And his  share is two or three weeks’. And if it is too hard </li>
<li>in your eyes, let my yoke rest on others, so that they know that a man  was among them. Spread a booth of peace  </li>
<li>over the delightful brother – ‘a precious vessel are the lips of knowledge’ (Proverbs 20:15) – our master and teacher, the student, son of the  judge – may he, all of his  </li>
<li>father’s household and all of his sons live in the midst of years. They  are in my thoughts until I pay what I vowed concerning them</li>
<li>at their appeal. And as for the boy Abu-’l-Bayān – his Rock preserve  him – bring him close to you and tell him  </li>
<li>that I have not abandoned him because of the meagerness of his gift,  but that I [still] have an obligation to him. He is an orphan and has no one to help him.  </li>
<li>And when I return safely, I shall complete his work, with the kindness of my Creator. May he prosper in what he does. And as for his uncles,</li>
<li>the Shaykh Samawāl Rashīd and his brother R. Joshua, may their horn  be raised in honour. And may the wellbeing of all  </li>
<li>our friends increase; may their tents be at rest and may they be secure! Yexi’el son of the scholar Elyaqim, ‘he who walks righteously and  speaks uprightly’ (Isaiah 33:15).  </li>

                        <ol>
<li>And the elder, Shaykh Abu’l-Faraj, asks after the wellbeing of his  household and of the little one, the son of his daughter, and he gives some instructions concerning him. </li>
<li>Everything is fine here with us; we are all alive.</li>
