In Your name.
There was submitted to the Presence, the commander of the faithful, a petition in the name (ruqʿa mutarjama)
of the community of Rabbanite Jews, in which they ask 
to be treated according to the noble decree (sijill mukarram) 
registered on their behalf (muktatab lahum), namely, that their ḥaverim (aḥbāruhum) be able 
to fulfill the requirements of their religious practices and their ancient customs (furūḍ diyānatihim wa-sālif sunanihim) 
in their synagogues and to serve 
their communities in Jerusalem, Ramla, and other 
places; that those who interfere with them should be stopped, 
as this is not compatible with the justice of the government (ʿadl al-dawla);
that they (those who interfere with them)  should not be given a free hand to do what is not in accordance with established usage; 
that they should not be disturbed on their holidays 
or while they hold their services on them; and that those among their adversaries
who do such things should be checked. Therefore the Commander 
of the Faithful has ordered the writing of a decree (manshūran) entailing the checking of 
each of the two Jewish groups, the 
Rabbanites and the Qaraites, that they should not interfere with one 
another; and all who belong to one of these 
two schools be allowed to conduct themselves according to the customs 
taught in their religious schools (diyānātihim) without the harassment 
of one of the two parties against the other.
The Qaraites should not harass 
the leaders of the Rabbanites by expelling them from the districts 
of Jerusalem and Palestine, and the merchants of the two parties 
should conduct themselves according to 
their customs with regard to transactions of buying and selling, 
or abstaining from such according to their wishes on 
their holidays. Each of the two groups shall beware 
of acting against the provisions of this order (ḥukm). 
Let it be known that anyone who disobeys or trespasses 
will be subject to heavy punishment, which will deter him and discourage 
others. It was deemed necessary to address you (the lower official) about them (the two groups of Jews) so that 
you should exercise the utmost caution not to show any preference
or partiality, and that you arrest anyone who 
contravenes this edict (maʾmūr), and that you report to me his situation.
Be cognizant of what the Commander of the Faithful has communicated to you 
and pay attention to what he has commanded you, 
and act in accordance with it and on the basis of it, if God wills.
