<li>In Your name.</li>
<li>There was submitted to the Presence, the commander of the faithful, a petition in the name (ruqʿa mutarjama)</li>
<li>of the community of Rabbanite Jews, in which they ask&nbsp;</li>
<li>to be treated according to the noble decree (sijill mukarram)&nbsp;</li>
<li>registered on their behalf (muktatab lahum), namely, that their ḥaverim (aḥbāruhum) be able&nbsp;</li>
<li>to fulfill the requirements of their religious practices and their ancient customs (furūḍ diyānatihim wa-sālif sunanihim)&nbsp;</li>
<li>in their synagogues and to serve&nbsp;</li>
<li>their communities in Jerusalem, Ramla, and other&nbsp;</li>
<li>places; that those who interfere with them should be stopped,&nbsp;</li>
<li>as this is not compatible with the justice of the government (ʿadl al-dawla);</li>
<li>that they (those who interfere with them) &nbsp;should not be given a free hand to do what is not in accordance with established usage;&nbsp;</li>
<li>that they should not be disturbed on their holidays&nbsp;</li>
<li>or while they hold their services on them; and that those among their adversaries</li>
<li>who do such things should be checked. Therefore the Commander&nbsp;</li>
<li>of the Faithful has ordered the writing of a decree (manshūran) entailing the checking of&nbsp;</li>
<li>each of the two Jewish groups, the&nbsp;</li>
<li>Rabbanites and the Qaraites, that they should not interfere with one&nbsp;</li>
<li>another; and all who belong to one of these&nbsp;</li>
<li>two schools be allowed to conduct themselves according to the customs&nbsp;</li>
<li>taught in their religious schools (diyānātihim) without the harassment&nbsp;</li>
<li>of one of the two parties against the other.</li>
<li>The Qaraites should not harass&nbsp;</li>
<li>the leaders of the Rabbanites by expelling them from the districts&nbsp;</li>
<li>of Jerusalem and Palestine, and the merchants of the two parties&nbsp;</li>
<li>should conduct themselves according to&nbsp;</li>
<li>their customs with regard to transactions of buying and selling,&nbsp;</li>
<li>or abstaining from such according to their wishes on&nbsp;</li>
<li>their holidays. Each of the two groups shall beware&nbsp;</li>
<li>of acting against the provisions of this order (ḥukm).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Let it be known that anyone who disobeys or trespasses&nbsp;</li>
<li>will be subject to heavy punishment, which will deter him and discourage&nbsp;</li>
<li>others. It was deemed necessary to address you (the lower official) about them (the two groups of Jews) so that&nbsp;</li>
<li>you should exercise the utmost caution not to show any preference</li>
<li>or partiality, and that you arrest anyone who&nbsp;</li>
<li>contravenes this edict (maʾmūr), and that you report to me his situation.</li>
<li>Be cognizant of what the Commander of the Faithful has communicated to you&nbsp;</li>
<li>and pay attention to what he has commanded you,&nbsp;</li>
<li>and act in accordance with it and on the basis of it, if God wills.</li>
<li>...</li>
