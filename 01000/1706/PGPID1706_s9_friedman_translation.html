<li>By the name of our Creator. May we build and prosper.</li>
<li>On the first day of the week, which is the twenty-second day of the month Tevet, in the third year of the sabbatical cycle, which is year four thousand, eight</li>
<li>hundre[d and] twelve A.M., in the city of Ramle, which is adjacent to Lod, in the territory of the Judeans. Thus happened: Marwān b. Toviah</li>
<li>[had divorced(?) Sarwa] daughter of Mevorakh some time ago and then desired to take her back as his wife, as in former days. And he declared intentionally, willingly,</li>
<li>[of] his ow[n choice], and voluntarily to Sarwa daughter of Mevorakh: "Be my wife according to the law of the Jews. I will nourish, provide for, esteem, honor,</li>
<li>[clothe and cover] you, in the manner of Jewish men, who nourish, provide for, esteem honor, clothe and cover their wives,</li>
<li>the respe[ctable daughters of Israel]." This Sarwa daughter of Mevorakh consented and became the wife of Marwān b. Toviah, as he had desired and requested her.</li>
<li>[And she took upon] hers[elf] to honor and attend him in purity and cleanness, in the manner of all respectable daughters of Israel. The marriage gift (qiddushin) which which he betrothed (qiddesh) her</li>
<li>[is seven dinars.] Of them the advanced mohar is two dinars, and there remain for her, incumbent upon him, the security of the ketubba, five dinars, a strong and firm debt.</li>
<li>[These are what t]his bride [brought in] to her husband&rsquo;s home: a pair of earrings &mdash;1 din.;<del> two pairs of bangles</del>; (one) hammered work and (one) manfūkh, silver; a silver kohl stick; and two rings</li>
<li>[&hellip;] 2 din.; two wraps, unbleached and bleached &mdash;3 din.; a black gown of Susa material &mdash;1 din.; an unbleached gown and a slip &mdash;1 din.;</li>
<li>[&hellip;] three ʿaqabiyya, a band and a white wimple &mdash;2 din.; three cushions, a wimple, and a delicate kerchief &mdash;1 din.; //a Ṭabari pad &mdash;1/3 din.// a white gown of Susa material</li>
<li>[&hellip;] and a mortar &mdash;3 din. The total that this bride brought in to her husband&rsquo;s house is 17 1/3 //dinars//. Willingly this</li>
<li>[Sarwa appointed] Yosef ha-Levi b. Khalaf as her agent, as witnessed by two witnesses who kne[w her. And] with this understanding,</li>
<li>the two sides [consent]ed and instructed the scribe to write and the signatories to sing. And we performed a qinyan with [&hellip;] with an implement&nbsp;</li>
<li>[suitable] for doing so. And we wrote and signed so that it be between them as a title of rights and as proof. In good order.</li>
<li>[She]lomo ha-Kohen b. Yefet, (his) t(estimony) w(ritten) b(y his) i(instructions). Yosef ha-Levi b. Yitzḥaq, (his) t(estimony) w(ritten) b(y his) i(instructions). Yefe[t&hellip;]</li>
<li>[ʿA]mram b. Mevasser (may his) e(nd be) g(ood). Yefet b. Mawhūb (who) r(ests in) [Eden]. Yeshūʿa b. Yitz[ḥaq].</li>
<li>Ḥasan b. Zakharia&nbsp; (who) r(ests in) E(den).</li>
<li>Yehoshūʿa ha-ḥazzan b. rabbi ʿEli ha-ḥaver (whose) s(oul is at) r(est).</li>
