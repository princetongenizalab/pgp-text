By the name of our Creator. May we build and prosper.
On the first day of the week, which is the twenty-second day of the month Tevet, in the third year of the sabbatical cycle, which is year four thousand, eight
hundre[d and] twelve A.M., in the city of Ramle, which is adjacent to Lod, in the territory of the Judeans. Thus happened: Marwān b. Toviah
[had divorced(?) Sarwa] daughter of Mevorakh some time ago and then desired to take her back as his wife, as in former days. And he declared intentionally, willingly,
[of] his ow[n choice], and voluntarily to Sarwa daughter of Mevorakh: "Be my wife according to the law of the Jews. I will nourish, provide for, esteem, honor,
[clothe and cover] you, in the manner of Jewish men, who nourish, provide for, esteem honor, clothe and cover their wives,
the respe[ctable daughters of Israel]." This Sarwa daughter of Mevorakh consented and became the wife of Marwān b. Toviah, as he had desired and requested her.
[And she took upon] hers[elf] to honor and attend him in purity and cleanness, in the manner of all respectable daughters of Israel. The marriage gift (qiddushin) which which he betrothed (qiddesh) her
[is seven dinars.] Of them the advanced mohar is two dinars, and there remain for her, incumbent upon him, the security of the ketubba, five dinars, a strong and firm debt.
[These are what t]his bride [brought in] to her husband’s home: a pair of earrings —1 din.; two pairs of bangles; (one) hammered work and (one) manfūkh, silver; a silver kohl stick; and two rings
[…] 2 din.; two wraps, unbleached and bleached —3 din.; a black gown of Susa material —1 din.; an unbleached gown and a slip —1 din.;
[…] three ʿaqabiyya, a band and a white wimple —2 din.; three cushions, a wimple, and a delicate kerchief —1 din.; //a Ṭabari pad —1/3 din.// a white gown of Susa material
[…] and a morter —3 din. The total that this bride brought in to her husband’s house is 17 1/3 //dinars//. Willingly this
[Sarwa appointed] Yosef ha-Levi b. Khalaf as her agent, as witnessed by two witnesses who kne[w her. And] with this understanding,
the two sides [consent]ed and instructed the scribe to write and the signatories to sing. And we performed a qinyan with […] with an implement 
[suitable] for doing so. And we wrote and signed so that it be between them as a title of rights and as proof. In good order.
[She]lomo ha-Kohen b. Yefet, (his) t(estimony) w(ritten) b(y his) i(instructions). Yosef ha-Levi b. Yitzḥaq, (his) t(estimony) w(ritten) b(y his) i(instructions). Yefe[t…]
