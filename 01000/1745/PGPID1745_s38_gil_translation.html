<li>This is nowadays the original (deed) and the declaration that declares the state of every apartment, (stating) who is the one who dedicated it and for which purpose.</li>
<li>I received it from the heirs of our Master, the Great Prince of Israel, Nethaneel, the Head of the Yeshīvā, ha-Levi, of blessed memory, known</li>
<li>as al-Rayyis Hibat Allah b. al-Shinshshī, may they repose in Paradise. I handed it over to our Master, the Great Prince of Israel</li>
<li>(4-5) Abraham the Nāgīd of the People of God, the son of our Lord and Master Moses; the Great Master, the Light of the Universe and its Wonder, from sunrise to sunset, may the memory of the Righteous and Sage be blessed. Then, at a later time I requested it from him but he did not find it since it was missing</li>
<li> </li>
<li>…. But when there occurred the appointment of His Excellency, His Great Honorable Holiness, our Lord, Master and Nāgīd, the Light of our eyes, the Beloved of our soul,</li>
<li>R. David, His Highness, the Great Prince, (that is) his second appointment, by which he received the sovereignty without</li>
<li>Any construct or pressure, in the month of Muḥarram of the year 650 of the hijra, corresponding to Nisan of the year</li>
<li>1563 of the documents, this record of the court concerning the waqf of the heqdēsh that was missing was brought to him. Now it is kept by</li>
<li>His Excellency. It is an ancient original that requires careful handling. So whoever intends to read it should request it from him.</li>
