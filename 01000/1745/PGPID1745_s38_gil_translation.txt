This is nowadays the original (deed) and the declaration that declares the state of every apartment, (stating) who is the one who dedicated it and for which purpose.
I received it from the heirs of our Master, the Great Prince of Israel, Nethaneel, the Head of the Yeshīvā, ha-Levi, of blessed memory, known
as al-Rayyis Hibat Allah b. al-Shinshshī, may they repose in Paradise. I handed it over to our Master, the Great Prince of Israel
(4-5) Abraham the Nāgīd of the People of God, the son of our Lord and Master Moses; the Great Master, the Light of the Universe and its Wonder, from sunrise to sunset, may the memory of the Righteous and Sage be blessed. Then, at a later time I requested it from him but he did not find it since it was missing
 
…. But when there occurred the appointment of His Excellency, His Great Honorable Holiness, our Lord, Master and Nāgīd, the Light of our eyes, the Beloved of our soul,
R. David, His Highness, the Great Prince, (that is) his second appointment, by which he received the sovereignty without
Any construct or pressure, in the month of Muḥarram of the year 650 of the hijra, corresponding to Nisan of the year
1563 of the documents, this record of the court concerning the waqf of the heqdēsh that was missing was brought to him. Now it is kept by
His Excellency. It is an ancient original that requires careful handling. So whoever intends to read it should request it from him.
