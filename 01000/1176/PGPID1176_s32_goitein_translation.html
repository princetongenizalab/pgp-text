                        <p>We, the undersigned at the bottom of this document, declare that we were present in the court of &hellip; (12 titles) ... our lord Nethanel ha-Levi, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof &mdash; may his name last forever, when Mulūk, the widow of the cantor Khalaf, known as Ben al-Muṭarrī &mdash; m(ay he rest in) E(den) &mdash; appeared before us together with her boy Manṣūr. She requested his excellency our lord to let her boy study the Torah with the cantor Abu Saʾd, known as "the son of the (woman) teacher," m(aster) and t(eacher) Saʾadya, the hon(ored) cantor and teacher, son of m. a. t. Abraham, the respected elder &mdash; m(ay he rest in) E(den), and that payment for the instruction be made to him from (revenue of) "the compound of the poor" at the usual rate of two dirhems per month. As this sum was the highest permissible under the circumstances, we approved this expenditure of two dirhems per month for the instruction of the aforementioned orphan, Manṣūr, to be paid continuously from the rents of the estate belonging to the community, as the court is aware of the purpose of instruction in the case of the aforementioned Manṣūr. This occurred in the month of Adar 1471 of (the era of) the documents. It was written down so as to serve as an instrument for securing rights. All is approved, ratified, and valid.&nbsp;</p>
