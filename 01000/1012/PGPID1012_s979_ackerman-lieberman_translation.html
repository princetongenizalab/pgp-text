                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol><li>Testimony which took place before us—we, the undersigned—on (Thurs)day, the twenty-</li><li>third day of the month of Shevaṭ of the year one thousand four hundred and six years according to the count to which we are accustomed, </li><li>in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. Thus: M(r.) Solomon b. David, known as</li><li>al-Dustarī came before us and said to us thus: “I sued Mr. Benaiah b. Moses (who) r(ests in) E(den) in the court (may) Go(d) pr(otect it)</li><li>for seventy dinars with which I partnered with him by way of a commenda (muḍāraba), and all that came to me from it</li><li>by way of compensation was ten dinars and (a little) something. The Elders of the Congregation, may they be blessed to the Heavens, came between us and effected a separation</li><li>between us of ten dinars and a single qirāṭ, of which he gave me five dinars and a qirāṭ immediately</li><li>leaving me a balance of five dinars therefrom. We agreed that he would write an agency (agreement) for (a debt owed by) Jacob al-Ḥarīrī</li><li>for two dinars which I would take from him (in payments of) a quarter(-dinar) each month, the first of which being Adar of the aforementioned year,</li><li>and three dinars owed by M(r.) Jacob al-Ṣabbāgh which Ie would take from him (in payments of) an eighth of a dinar each month, the first of which is also Adar,</li><li>on the condition that I would demand and urge and strive in all that. The guarantee of this five dinars would be the responsibility of</li><li>this m(aster) Benaiah. A qinyan was performed with us in that matter. I agreed to this in accordance with my will, thus testify on my behalf and perform a qinyan with me effective immediately,</li><li>using all the language of claims, write and sign and give it to Mr. Benaiah b. Moses (who) r(ests in) E(den,) in order that he would have in his hand a title of right</li><li>and proof. That was in accordance with my will and desire. I attest before you, without duress nor any of the factors which invalidate testimony,</li><li>rather with a full heart and a desirous spirit, that I have agreed to this determination. I have received from him the five dinars and a qirāṭ,</li><li>and I have released him (from the obligation of checking) their weight and engraving, and I have released him from all that I demanded of him in the court (may) Go(d) pr(otect it,) and it from all other </li><li>claims and demands and obligations and responsibilities which passed between us from the beginning of time until now, a complete and total release,</li><li>a release of receipt and acceptance, an irreversible release without any legal document nullifying it, a release from me—I, Solomon</li><li>b. David—and from my heirs after my death from any debt or matter and from overreaching and grievance (claims,) from human law and from Heavenly law,</li><li>and from oaths and decrees and rider oaths and pronouncements—general and specific—and from the determination of any court, whether in </li><li>Jewish law</li></ol>
