                        <p>This is to inform you my lord, the elder, may God make your honored position permanent, that Abu ʾl-Ḥasan, after his transfer to my school, showed great zeal for study. His great misfortune was that Abu ʾl-Ḥasan b. Wuhayb broke his board with the knowledge of the other boys. And peace.&nbsp;</p>
