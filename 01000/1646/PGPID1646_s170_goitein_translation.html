                        <p>Dear and beloved elder and leader, may God prolong your life,&nbsp;never take away your rank, and increase his favors and benefactions&nbsp;to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I inform you, my elder, that I have arrived safely. I have written&nbsp;you a letter before, but have seen no answer. Happy preoccupations&mdash;I hope.&nbsp;In that letter I provided you with all the necessary information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I loaded nine pieces of antimony (kohl), five in baskets and four in complete pieces, on the boat of Ibn Jubar&mdash;may Good keep it;&nbsp;these are for you personally, sent by Musa Ibn al-Majjani.6 On this&nbsp;boat, I have in partnership with you&mdash;may God keep you&mdash;a load&nbsp;of cast copper, a basket with (copper) fragments,7 and two pieces of&nbsp;antimony. I hope God will grant their safe arrival. Kindly take delivery&nbsp;of everything, my lord.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also sent with Banana a camel load for you from Ibn al-Majjani, and a camel load for me in partnership with you&mdash;may God keep you. He also carries another partnership of mine, namely, with 'Ammar Ibn Yiju, four small jugs (of oil). With Abu Zayd I have a shipload of tin in partnership with Salama al-Mahdawī. Your share in this partnership with him is fifty pounds. I also have seventeen small jugs of s[oap]. I hope they arrive safely. They belong to a man [called . . .]r b. Salmun, who entrusted them to me at his own risk. Also a bundle of hammered copper, belonging to [a Muslim] man from the Maghreb, called Abu Bakr Ibn Rizq Allah. Two other bundles, on one is written Abraham, on the other M[...]. I agreed with the shipowner that he would transport the goods to their destination. I wish my brother Abu Nasr&mdash;may God preserve him&mdash;to take care of all the goods and carry them to his place until I shall arrive, if God wills. Please sell the tin for me at whatever price God may grant and leave its "purse" (the money received for it) until my arrival. I am ready to travel, but must stay until I can unload the tar and oil from the ships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no doubt that you have sent me a letter containing all the&nbsp;quotations.&nbsp;I have learned that the government has seized the oil&nbsp;and that&nbsp;Ibn al-Nafiat&nbsp;has taken the payment upon himself. I hope that this&nbsp;is indeed the case. Please take care of this matter and take from him&nbsp;the price of five skins (filled with oil). The account is with Salama.</p>
<p>Al-Sabbagh&nbsp;of Tripoli has bribed Bu Ί-'Ala the agent, and I shall&nbsp;unload my goods soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindest regards to your noble self and to my master [. . .&nbsp;and]&nbsp;Abu Ί-Fadl, may God keep them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abu Ί-Faraj Marwan&nbsp;sends you kindest regards and says&nbsp;to you: "I have with All Ibn Jubar&nbsp;two baskets with liquid storax(?).&nbsp;I ask you, my lord&mdash;may God protect you&mdash;to order one of&nbsp;your boys to receive them and [to transporjt them to Abu Ja'far Ibn&nbsp;al-Mudallal,&nbsp;the agent. I have not fixed the freight with him,&nbsp;except&nbsp;that he would charge me what he charges others.&nbsp;The textiles were taken by Ben Sara,&nbsp;for he . . . [. . .] and said to me: "I shall take care of the cost of the transport"&mdash;the soul knows&nbsp;what is in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isma'il Ibn Abi 'Uqba&nbsp;greets you and asks you to receive a shipload&nbsp;of wax for him. It is in the boat of Abu Zayd and a quarter&nbsp;dinar has to be paid for its transport. It was loaded by Khalluf. "Ibn&nbsp;al-Shama,"&nbsp;and "Joseph b. Isra'il b. Banuqa"&nbsp;are written on it.&nbsp;Give it (for sale) to any agent you see fit.&nbsp;And peace upon you, may God preserve you.</p>
<p>(P.S., by the copyist:)&nbsp;And I, Daniel Ibn al-Shama, greet my&nbsp;lord and his boys&mdash;may God protect you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isma'il Ibn Abi 'Uqba has a shipload of corals with Banana, the&nbsp;sailor.&nbsp;You also have four (?) barqalus&nbsp;of wax with Ibn Jubar.&nbsp;(Another line and a short marginal note, both in the second script&nbsp;and mostly illegible, follow here.)</p>
<p>(To) my elder and master Abu Ί-Faraj, may God protect him,&nbsp;Joseph, son of Jacob Ibn 'Awkal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From his old friend&nbsp;Abraham, son of Joseph, (may his) s(oul&nbsp;be at) r(est).</p>
