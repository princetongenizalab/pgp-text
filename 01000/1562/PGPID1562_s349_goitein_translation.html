<p>The elder Abū &lsquo;Alā Japheth, the &hellip;,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the son of the elder Maslī&rsquo;aḥ&mdash;may he rest in Eden&mdash;appeared before us and made the following deposition, while we were constituted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a court of three. He said: &ldquo;I was with the cantor, &lsquo;The Diadem&rsquo;&mdash;may God accept him with favor&mdash;when</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wuḥsha, the broker, came in and said: &lsquo;Do you not have an advice for me? I had an affair with Ḥassūn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and conceived from him. We contracted a marriage before a Muslim notary, but I am afraid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that he may deny being the father of my child.&rsquo; She then lived in the house of Ben al-Sukkarī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the uppermost floor. He (the cantor) said: &lsquo;Go and gather some people, and let them surprise you with him so that your assertion might be confirmed.&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She did so, gathering two who surprised her with him, and confirmed her assertion. She was then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pregnant with this Abū Sa&rsquo;d, her son, whom she had conceived in her illicit relation with Ḥassūn. I know also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that she went on the Fast of Atonement to the synagogue of the Iraqians, but when</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Nāsī of blessed memory noticed her, he expelled her from the synagogue. I know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all this for sure, and deposit herewith my testimony to this effect. There appeared also in court</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ritual slaughterer Abū Sa&rsquo;īd Ḥalfōn ha-Kohen, son of Rabbi Joseph ha-Kohen&mdash;may he rest in Eden&mdash;and deposited the following witness in our presence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"I was living in the house of Hibat Allah Ben al-Sukkari&mdash;may God accept him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with favor&mdash;on the ground floor for many years, while Wuḥsha, the broker,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had her domicile in the uppermost part of the house. In those days, she came down once to one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the tenants, namely Abū Naṣr, the Kohen, the cantor Ben al-Kāmukhī, and to Abraham</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Jerusalemite, known as the son of the mrhṭ, and said to them: &lsquo;Please,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>come up with me to my room for something. The two went up with her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and found Ḥassūn sitting in her place and....</p>
