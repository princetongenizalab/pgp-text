                        <ol><li>Testimony that was before us—we, the undersigned witnesses—that in the </li><li>middle ten-day period of the month of Tammuz of the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-nine</li><li>(of the Era) of Documents, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River, jurisdiction of our lord</li><li>our Nagid Abraham, the outstanding Rav, the mighty Hammer, Lamp of the West, Standard of the Sages,</li><li>Inimitable of the Generation and its Wonder, the great Nagid, may (God) raise up his glory and enhance his honor. The Elder</li><li>Munajjā al-‘Aṭṭār b. the Elder Abū Sa‘d al-‘Aṭṭār, the beloved Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us, and said to us,</li><li>“Perform a qinyan with me and testify concerning me using all the appropriate legal formulae and the expressions of certainty</li><li>and all the language of claims, write and sign, in order there would be proof and a legal claim that I have</li><li>released Abū al-Khayr b. the Elder Abū al-Riḍā al-Naqqād ha-Levi the beloved Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den) from</li><li>all rights, claims, oaths, vows and rider oaths, and all legal judgments</li><li>from the beginning of time until now. Nothing remains for me with him—neither a claim nor a demand concerning a partnership (shirka) </li><li>nor concerning a debt nor concerning a deposit nor concerning a joint enterprise (mu‘āmala) nor concerning a commenda. I have forgiven any claim</li><li>assigned to me before him with a definitive, conclusive forgiveness, from a farthing up to a hundred dinars, except for</li><li>the document which I have against him for fourteen dinars, (to be paid in) installments of a dinar each month, as </li><li>he testified in that formalized document. I have approved as payment the merchandise which was </li><li>in the shop as the partnership (shirka) between us at that time, and I have taken this according to what they estimated for me. I have approved that</li><li>completely, and I may not renounce this in any occurrence or situation. I have taken upon myself the debts</li><li>of the aforementioned shop whose total is eight hundred dirhams. If it turns out to be more than that,</li><li>I will be obligated in half and Abū al-Khayr will be obligated in half. If we receive what is due us from (our) working-partners</li><li>over and above nine hundred dirhams // it will be divided in halves, exactly, between us.// Both of us will help in collecting it. He has</li><li>released the six copper basins to the Elder Munajjā, and whatever is missing from them, half of it will be upon the Elder (A)bū</li><li>al-Khayr</li></ol>
