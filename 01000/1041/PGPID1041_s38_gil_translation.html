<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;of her own, as from today and after death.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;At that time, her mind was sound, she knew what she was saying&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and talking. She knew that that day was&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(16-19) Saturday. Then the said Kohen "who separates the fingers" and the said elder Abūʾ1-Faraj b. al-Ramlī informed her that she gave and donated to her slave girls, the virgins, Dhahab and Sitt al-Samar&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>&nbsp;their life in the part of the qōdesh in the room</p>

<p>&nbsp;in which the witnessing took place, provided they&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>&nbsp;remain of Jewish faith. The apartment and the ruin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;opposite the compound, and half the compound will belong to her husband&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;our Leader Nathan, "the Diadem of the Scholars. They said that the two</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;above-mentioned kōhanīm had their names written (also) in her ketubbā. She indicated&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;that her muʾakhkhar was 50 dinars. The ketubbā&nbsp;</p>

                        <ol>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;they should sell the eighth ot the compound that is behind the Mosque,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2-3) in partnership with the Sultan, may God support him, and the elder Abūʾl-Aʿlā b. Tamām, of blessed memory, and it should be spent on all that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;she will need: Shrouds, the coffin, cantors, tomb, porters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and all her funeral expenses, and if that is not enough for it they should sell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the tiara that is with her husband, the "Diadem" (of the Scholars), and cover with it&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the missing part. It has eleven segments.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Then her husband the "Diadem" (of the Scholars) said: "Yes, I have it". If there is something left from the sum received for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the eighth of the said compound it should be given to the two slave girls&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;mentioned above. Any clothes that are fit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;for women shall be given to the two of them and whatever is not fit for women should be given to her husband,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;the "Diadem&rdquo; (of the Scholars). It was Saturday, so we did not conclude any deed of his&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;to confirm what she said, but whatever I heard&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;her saying I recorded, so that if she died and anyone asked&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;me for the testimony I should not forget it.</p>
