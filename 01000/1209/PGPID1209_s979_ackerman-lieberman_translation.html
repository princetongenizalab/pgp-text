                        <ol><li>[“Perform a qinyan with me from now] on, write and sign using all [the appropriate legal formulae]</li><li>and the expressions of certainty, and all language of claim[s, and] give it to us in order that each of us would have before</li><li>his fellow from this day forward proof and a legal claim that each of us attests before you, using the most certain and trustworthy expressions of</li><li>affirmation, in our good health and freedom of will, willingly, with neither duress nor force</li><li>nor compulsion, with neither negligence nor [error, without] illness of dis[ea]se among us, nor any of the like from the factors which invalidate</li><li>testimony, that each of us […] to his fellow in this partnership (shirka) that which is ascribable to each of them, respectively, </li><li>in this matter, and obligates himself [from] now on […]. None of this may be nullified, nor does he have any support therein</li><li>for with any sort of legal claim whatsoever, for profit and loss, […] or for a guarantee or a (claim of) deception in the expenses, or of wasted time </li><li>nor a debt nor anything else mentioned above. This was (effected) in accordance with our intention and our free will and our preference.</li><li>We wrote this document in order that each of us would have in his hand (a document) well-order[ed,] and [proper and] enduring and durable, each of us</li><li>before his fellow, upon which any co[ur]t anywhere would rely, not like formularies or like</li><li>prototypes of documents, but rather as the most certain and trustworthy of that which the Sages, (may their) m(emory be) f(or a blessing) outlined, in the like. Each of us takes (upon himself)</li><li>towards his fellow the fulfillment (of this agreement) in his lifetime and upon his heirs after his death, concerning all that which he took </li><li>upon himself in this account, from beginning to end, and all that which is ascribable to him therein with the most certain</li><li>and perfect of guarantees of [fulfillment.] We have nullified all secret dispositions and conditions</li><li>and secret dispositions concerning secret dispositions and secret dispositions that may develop from secret dispositions forevermore, which may be made for us</li><li>and which we have made concerning this partnership document as a decree of the Sages. We performed a qinyan with (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Abraham</li><li>b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Moses the Elder, known as al-Mirjānī (who) r(ests in) E(den), and with (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Mevorakh b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Eleazar </li><li>the Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den), a complete and weighty qinyan, with an item suitable for doing so, effective immediately, and from “hand to hand”, using all the language</li><li>which the Sages used to nullify therein terms and conditions of each of them to his fellow, with an item suitable</li><li>for doing so, concerning everything written and explained above. That which happened before us—we, the court</li><li>and those that signed along with us at the bottom—we wrote and signed two copies and gave one</li><li>of them to this M(r.) Abraham and one of them to this M(r.) Mevorakh, in order that they would have in their hands a title of right and proof.</li><li>That was on Wednesday, the first of the month of Sivan of the year dated above. Our signature was delayed</li><li>until the following Thursday, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. Proper and clear and enduring.</li><li>Isaac b. Samuel ha-Sephardi (may he) m(erit) l(ife in) the n(ext) w(orld)</li></ol>
<p>Blessing above and below Isaac’s name: … (unintelligible)</p>
