                        <h3>Recto </h3>
                    
                        <p>29. Regarding Ibrāhīm b. Fadānj and Ibrāhīm b. al-Harūnī, they arrived in&nbsp;</p>
<p>30. Jerusalem from the Christian lands (bilād al-rūm: Byzantium) after the suffering&nbsp; they endured, as you know. When Ibn&nbsp;</p>
<p>31. Fadānj arrived in Ramallah with his wife and children, poor captives,before reaching Jerusalem the people of Toledo&nbsp; had&nbsp;</p>
<p>32. the bright idea of reporting them to the Karaites because his wife was forbidden to him. As soon as I received news of this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <ol>
<li>
<p>I contacted them&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which caused&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a stir amongst them and I curse&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whoever had spread word of&nbsp; this affair&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because I</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knew that it would reach the&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karaites.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they got&nbsp; to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jerusalem they went up to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samareitike and stayed with them,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they became one of them,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they lived amongst them,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they were taken into&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a home and treated&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well. After</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they had stayed with them for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about two years they&nbsp; spread&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>word of the affair to the Karaite authorities, asserting&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;that he was&nbsp; staying with / his wife which was forbidden&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>according to their doctrines.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They intended to separate&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the two of them and as soon as&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found out about&nbsp; it&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lodged a complaint&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and, amongst us, this created&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;a controversy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
