                        <h3>Recto </h3>
                    
                        <p>29. Regarding Ibrāhīm b. Fadānj and Ibrāhīm b. al-Harūnī, they arrived in&nbsp;</p>
<p>30. Jerusalem from the Christian lands (bilād al-rūm: Byzantium) after the suffering&nbsp; they endured, as you know. When Ibn&nbsp;</p>
<p>31. Fadānj arrived in Ramallah with his wife and children, poor captives,before reaching Jerusalem the people of Toledo&nbsp; had&nbsp;</p>
<p>32. the bright idea of reporting them to the Karaites because his wife was forbidden to him. As soon as I received news of this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    
                        <h3>Right Margin </h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>I contacted them&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which caused&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a stir amongst them and I curse&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whoever had spread word of&nbsp; this affair&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because I</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>knew that it would reach the&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Karaites.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they got&nbsp; to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jerusalem they went up to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samareitike and stayed with them,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they became one of them,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they lived amongst them,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they were taken into&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a home and treated&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well. After</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they had stayed with them for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about two years they&nbsp; spread&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>word of the affair to the Karaite authorities, asserting&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;that he was&nbsp; staying with / his wife which was forbidden&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>according to their doctrines.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They intended to separate&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the two of them and as soon as&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found out about&nbsp; it&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lodged a complaint&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and, amongst us, this created&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;a controversy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>I then updated our lord, the president of the court, about the poor captive woman and he sent a message to the Karaites that said&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that he could only divorce her according to the doctrine by which he had entered into marriage with her and that his marriage certificate had been issued by the rabbis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He would pay her dowry and then he would divorce her. I continued to&nbsp; follow the matter until the rabbis received him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and he stayed with them along with his wife and children, Abū Zikrī, Yosef, Mūsā and Ḥalwa. They lodged in a house&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>amongst the Rabbinites and they treated him well, they lacked for nothing and although they did not want to take them in&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because, as Rabbinites, they had become Karaites and had stayed with them for&nbsp; two years. When I saw what they wanted&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to do with the poor woman, to separate her from her husband, making the children orphans in the world, at a time of hardship&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and famine, I did for them what God will reward me for. Now he, the aforementioned Ibrāhīm, has gone&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with his son to a village in the Levant, near Jerusalem where they have a shop that provides them with sustenance.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are well, respected and nobody is of the opinion&nbsp; that there is evidence by which the two sisters are prohibited to him after&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>death. To this day, none of their specialists can offer proof that there is&nbsp; another possibility in his case except to affirm that this&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was customary with Anan, their leader, and the ancient Karaites, without getting tangled up in&nbsp; thorn bushes that should not be torn up. When&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they saw that Ibn Fadānj&nbsp; fled from them and returned to the Rabbinites, similar to he who said: I return&nbsp; to my first&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>husband because I was better then than now (Hosea 2:9), they&nbsp; slackened the rope and excused the matter of Jacob, fearing that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he would&nbsp; leave them as well. He stayed with his wife, although they took testimony&nbsp; from him that he would separate from her, which&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not command nor did it enter my mind (Jeremiah 7:31). I am updating you about this, my sister, so that you show his brother, my lord Mūsā</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Falmiqī, my letter. If I were not writing in such an improvised&nbsp; manner, I would have written to tell him so.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
