<li>Regarding Ibrāhīm b. Fadānj and Ibrāhīm b. al-Harūnī, they arrived in&nbsp;</li>
<li>Jerusalem from the Christian lands (bilād al-rūm: Byzantium) after the suffering&nbsp; they endured, as you know. When Ibn&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fadānj arrived in Ramla with his wife and children, poor captives, before reaching Jerusalem the people of Toledo had</li>
<li>the bright idea of reporting them to the Karaites because his wife was forbidden to him. As soon as I received news of this</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Right Margin </h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I contacted them&nbsp;</li>
<li>which caused&nbsp;</li>
<li>a stir amongst them and I curse&nbsp;</li>
<li>whoever had spread word of&nbsp; this affair&nbsp;</li>
<li>because I knew that it would reach the&nbsp;</li>
<li>Karaites. When they got&nbsp; to&nbsp;</li>
<li>Jerusalem they went up to&nbsp;</li>
<li>Samareitike and stayed with them,&nbsp;</li>
<li>they became one of them,&nbsp;</li>
<li>they lived amongst them,&nbsp;</li>
<li>they were taken into&nbsp;</li>
<li>a home and treated&nbsp;</li>
<li>well. After</li>
<li>they had stayed with them for&nbsp;</li>
<li>about two years they&nbsp; spread&nbsp;</li>
<li>word of the affair to the Karaite</li>
<li>authorities, asserting&nbsp;</li>
<li>that he was&nbsp; staying with</li>
<li>his wife which was forbidden&nbsp;</li>
<li>according to their doctrines.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They intended to separate&nbsp;</li>
<li>the two of them and as soon as&nbsp;</li>
<li>I found out about&nbsp; it&nbsp;</li>
<li>I lodged a complaint&nbsp;</li>
<li>and, amongst us, this created&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;a controversy&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I then updated our lord, the president of the court, about the poor captive woman and he sent a message to the Karaites that said&nbsp;</li>
<li>that he could only divorce her according to the doctrine by which he had entered into marriage with her and that his marriage certificate had been issued by the rabbis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>He would pay her dowry and then he would divorce her. I continued to&nbsp; follow the matter until the rabbis received him&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;and he stayed with them along with his wife and children, Abū Zikrī, Yosef, Mūsā and Ḥalwa. They lodged in a house&nbsp;</li>
<li>amongst the Rabbinites and they treated him well, they lacked for nothing and although they did not want to take them in&nbsp;</li>
<li>because, as Rabbinites, they had become Karaites and had stayed with them for&nbsp; two years. When I saw what they wanted&nbsp;</li>
<li>to do with the poor woman, to separate her from her husband, making the children orphans in the world, at a time of hardship&nbsp;</li>
<li>and famine, I did for them what God will reward me for. Now he, the aforementioned Ibrāhīm, has gone&nbsp;</li>
<li>with his son to a village in the Levant, near Jerusalem where they have a shop that provides them with sustenance.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They are well, respected and nobody is of the opinion&nbsp; that there is evidence by which the two sisters are prohibited to him after&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>death. To this day, none of their specialists can offer proof that there is&nbsp; another possibility in his case except to affirm that this&nbsp;</li>
<li>was customary with Anan, their leader, and the ancient Karaites, without getting tangled up in&nbsp; thorn bushes that should not be torn up. When&nbsp;</li>
<li>they saw that Ibn Fadānj&nbsp; fled from them and returned to the Rabbinites, similar to he who said: I return&nbsp; to my first&nbsp;</li>
<li>husband because I was better then than now (Hosea 2:9), they&nbsp; slackened the rope and excused the matter of Jacob, fearing that&nbsp;</li>
<li>he would&nbsp; leave them as well. He stayed with his wife, although they took testimony&nbsp; from him that he would separate from her, which&nbsp;</li>
<li>I did not command nor did it enter my mind (Jeremiah 7:31). I am updating you about this, my sister, so that you show his brother, my lord Mūsā</li>
<li>al-Falmiqī, my letter. If I were not writing in such an improvised&nbsp; manner, I would have written to tell him so.&nbsp;</li>
