Recto

To your honor, greatness, and holiness, excellent diadem and crown. 
To our master and teacher Eli the parnas, the trusted, the wise and discerning,
the righteous, the perfect and straight, who has done me many favors
since I came. I, your slave, the blind, fast
every Monday and Thursday. For a year I have not eaten
meat. I pray for you and your son R. Ephraim
day and night that God grant that you see sons
from him and rejoice in the[m], amen. Your slave
entreats God and you to do for me
a kindness by arranging [on my behalf] a pesiqa, because my wife and sons
are coming up from Alexandria, and they wrote to me that they do not have
 the fee for the boat. So do for me a kindness this
time, also, and your latter kindness toward me will be better
than the first. "You will decree and it will be fulfilled, and light will shine
upon your affairs" (Job 22:28). "Do not fail your servants" (Joshua 10:6). "Let not
the downtrodden turn away disappointed" (Psalm 74:21). May the God of Israel grant you good
old age and a good end and that you spend your days well.
 
Amen.
