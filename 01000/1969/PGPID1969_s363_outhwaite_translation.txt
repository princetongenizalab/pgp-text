To the honourable, great, holy, glorious crown and diadem,
to our master and our teacher ‘Eli the Parnas, the Trustee, the wise and  the discerning,  
the righteous, the pure, the upright man who has done me many favours
since my arrival. I, his blind servant, fast  
every Monday and Thursday, and it has been a year since I last ate
meat. I pray for you and for your son, R. Efraim,  
day and night that God may grant you the opportunity to see
male children from his loins and to delight in them. Amen. Your servant  
presents his supplication before the Lord and before you to act kindly  with me  
by holding a collection for me since my wife and my children,
who are due to come up from Alexandria, have written to me to say  that they lack  
the cost of the boat ride. So do me a kindness also  
this time too ‘and this last kindness shall be greater
than the first’ (Ruth 3:10) ‘and decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and  
light will shine on your ways’ (Job 22:28). Do not neglect your ser vant. ‘Do not  
let the oppressed return in shame’ (Pss 74:21). And the God of Israel  give you  
a good old age and a good end, and may you spend your days in prosperity  
and your years in delight. May your wellbeing increase forever.
Amen.
