<li>To the honourable, great, holy, glorious crown and diadem,</li>
<li>to our master and our teacher ‘Eli the Parnas, the Trustee, the wise and  the discerning,  </li>
<li>the righteous, the pure, the upright man who has done me many favours</li>
<li>since my arrival. I, his blind servant, fast  </li>
<li>every Monday and Thursday, and it has been a year since I last ate</li>
<li>meat. I pray for you and for your son, R. Efraim,  </li>
<li>day and night that God may grant you the opportunity to see</li>
<li>male children from his loins and to delight in them. Amen. Your servant  </li>
<li>presents his supplication before the Lord and before you to act kindly  with me  </li>
<li>by holding a collection for me since my wife and my children,</li>
<li>who are due to come up from Alexandria, have written to me to say  that they lack  </li>
<li>the cost of the boat ride. So do me a kindness also  </li>
<li>this time too ‘and this last kindness shall be greater</li>
<li>than the first’ (Ruth 3:10) ‘and decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and  </li>
<li>light will shine on your ways’ (Job 22:28). Do not neglect your ser vant. ‘Do not  </li>
<li>let the oppressed return in shame’ (Pss 74:21). And the God of Israel  give you  </li>
<li>a good old age and a good end, and may you spend your days in prosperity  </li>
<li>and your years in delight. May your wellbeing increase forever.</li>
<li>Amen.  </li>
