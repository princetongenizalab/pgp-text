<li>To your honor, greatness, and holiness, excellent diadem and crown.&nbsp;</li>
<li>To our master and teacher Eli the parnas, the trusted, the wise and discerning,</li>
<li>the righteous, the perfect and straight, who has done me many favors</li>
<li>since I came. I, your slave, the blind, fast</li>
<li>every Monday and Thursday. For a year I have not eaten</li>
<li>meat. I pray for you and your son R. Ephraim</li>
<li>day and night that God grant that you see sons</li>
<li>from him and rejoice in the[m], amen. Your slave</li>
<li>entreats God and you to do for me</li>
<li>a kindness by arranging [on my behalf] a pesiqa, because my wife and sons</li>
<li>are coming up from Alexandria, and they wrote to me that they do not have</li>
<li>&nbsp;the fee for the boat. So do for me a kindness this</li>
<li>time, also, and your latter kindness toward me will be better</li>
<li>than the first. "You will decree and it will be fulfilled, and light will shine</li>
<li>upon your affairs" (Job 22:28). "Do not fail your servants" (Joshua 10:6). "Let not</li>
<li>the downtrodden turn away disappointed" (Psalm 74:21). May the God of Israel grant you good</li>
<li>old age and a good end and that you spend your days well.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Amen.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
