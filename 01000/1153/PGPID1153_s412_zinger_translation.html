                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>The testimony which took place before us, we, the undersigned witnesses: On the middle ten days&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the month of Tammūz 1555AG (June 1244)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the dating of deeds, the dating to which we are accustomed in Fustat Mitzrayim&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>situated upon the River Nile, Aaron b. Abū al-Riḍā, m(ay he rest in) E(den) , and his wife, Labwa&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bt. Abū Ghālib, m(ay he rest in) E(den), came before us and told us: &ldquo;Make the symbolic purchase from us, a complete and rigorous purchase, as of now,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and write and sign using every expression of right that each of us, I, the aforementioned Aaron,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have released the obligation of Labwa7, my wife, from any claim, demand, oath and judicial proceedings,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the laws of men and the laws of heaven and from all types of different vows.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing in the world remains for me with her, neither small norlarge.&rdquo; Similarly,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;this Labwa bt. Abū Ghālib //said// &ldquo;Make the symbolic purchase from me and witness for me, as of now, that I released&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the obligation8 of my husband, Aaron b. Abū al-Riḍā, from all that women are due&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from men and from my ketubba, essential and additional, and from the dowry. I have released&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>him of all this orally and in (my) heart, in this world and in the next, a complete&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rigorous release. Nothing remains for me of his obligation from what is worth a penny or more.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, I gave to my husband, the aforementioned Aaron, all that I am due from his obligation: the essential&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ketubba, the addition and the dowry in a complete, clear and public gift, an&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>eternal gift, a gift of a healthy person, a gift that cannot be reversed, a definitive and certain gift&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as of now.&rdquo; Thus said to us this Labwa bt. Ghālib: &ldquo;Go around the markets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and in the public areas and make public this gift that it is not hidden nor concealed,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in my name from this day and forever. This Labwa also accepted that she will maintain her&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>older boy, Furayj, for two years fro[m the da]te of this deed in all his needs and his poll tax&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for two years not including his clothing (lit. his cover), and she accepted that she will maintain the younger one, Raḍī, for ten years from the date of&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this deed. She will (pay for) the older one&rsquo;s studying silversmithing. Aaron will clothe the two, i.e. his children.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We made the symbolic purchase from Aaron and Labwa, a complete, rigorous purchase as of now, cancelling&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all notifications and conditions on everything written and explicated above. Written between the lines&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the ninth line: &ldquo;and she said&rdquo; and this is its confirmation. Everything is true, correct and established.</p>
</li>
