                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>The slave kisses the ground before the glorious presence of our lord,</li>
<li>may he be exalted, magnified and live forever, and informs (him) that he (the petitioner) had submitted</li>
<li>before the glorious presence, may he be exalted, a petition containing</li>
<li>some explanation of his situation. Some of the students of our lord (the Nagid) came out (from the capital) and mentioned</li>
<li>to (your) servant on behalf of our master that he (the addressee)&nbsp;would not be ready to finish</li>
<li>the matter until after the holiday. He (the addressee) had previously generously promised</li>
<li>to execute the matter as it was known to him. The servant is</li>
<li>in a desperate situation in all his affairs. He (the petitioner) asks</li>
<li>of his (the addressee's) munificence not to neglect him, but to protect him in his weak state</li>
<li>and isolation. The knife has reached</li>
<li>the bone. His greatest adversity is in the matter of this creditor</li>
<li>and the fact that he is from among the extreme people (aṭrāf al-nās). He is justified, whereas I am</li>
<li>unjust toward him and myself, and I do not blame him; I have fallen in with him</li>
<li>_because of my many sins_ (Heb.). The purpose of this (petition) is that when</li>
<li>the master (the addressee) meets with the illustrious head (of the Jews), our master and teacher Avraham, the great rabbi, may his glory be exalted</li>
<li>and his honor increase, my master should inform him what he knows</li>
<li>to be the truth of your servant&rsquo;s situation and ask him to procure</li>
<li>sixty dirhams from anywhere possible and send for</li>
<li>the creditor and ask him to divide the amount into (installments of) ten</li>
<li>dirhams per month. For this is what he requested when he learned of</li>
<li>the situation (in which I find myself). He is well aware of my extreme predicament, since the legal document in his hand</li>
<li>divides it into twenty dirhams per month. Let it be promised</li>
<li>that the sixty dirhams be paid in six monthly installments. If</li>
<li>that is done, it will be help from God _by the merit_ (Heb.)</li>
<li>of our lord. The matter is easy. The matter can be put off until the end of</li>
<li>Passover, God willing, with the help of our lord and _by the merit_</li>
<li>of his father, may the memory of the righteous be a blessing. The servant has informed (you) of this, after having kissed</li>
<li>his (the addressee's) feet. May the welfare of his excellency, our saintly lord,</li>
<li>increase forever and never diminish. Forever, sela amen.</li>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>Concerning the matter of Reuben, who has a bill of debt [&hellip;]</li>
<li>and lacks the means of paying it, and does not have the means to support either</li>
<li>himself or his family, to the extent that, if he were able, he would swear</li>
<li>to his fellow litigant with a _solemn oath_ (Heb.) that he has nothing and is without</li>
<li>means, and that some of the fodder and furnishings are not designated to him</li>
<li>but to others, and that his opposing party is oppressing him and summons him</li>
<li>under gentile law. If he acknowledges (the debt before a notary), perhaps (the creditor) will make him suffer,&nbsp;</li>
<li>have him arrested and not abide by the ruling according to Jewish sharīʿa.</li>
<li>If he denies it, the qāḍī may require him to swear _an oath_ (Heb.),</li>
<li>and he would be afraid of (divine) _punishment_ (Heb.). Instruct us: if the violating litigant</li>
<li>transgresses and summons him to a gentile court, is he allowed</li>
<li>to swear that he does not owe him anything according to this ruling</li>
<li>and be exonerated? Is the debt binding given that he (the creditor) was&nbsp;</li>
<li>aware of the debtor's situation and knew the truth of</li>
<li>his destitution &mdash; may he send after the violating litigant and tell him,&nbsp;</li>
<li>&ldquo;if you summon him under gentile law, you will no longer have any claim</li>
<li>on him and you will be obligated by Jewish law to do such and such&rdquo;? May our lord instruct us and may he be granted a double reward</li>
<li>from heaven.</li>
