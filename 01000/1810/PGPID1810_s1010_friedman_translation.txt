Recto 
 

 
 

and this Mr. Sa’id, the groom, and this Maliha, his wife, 


agreed and fixed between themselves ketubba stipulations according to the law of Moses and the Jews: that if this Sai’d, the groom, hates this Maliha and does not desire her, but wants to separate 


from her, he will pay her all that is written and specified in this ketubba completely. And if this Maliha hates this Sa’id, her husband, and desires to go out 


from his house, she will lose her ketubba money and will take nothing except that which she brought from her fathers’ house, that alone, and she will go out with the permission of the court and on the authority 


of our lords the rabbis.
