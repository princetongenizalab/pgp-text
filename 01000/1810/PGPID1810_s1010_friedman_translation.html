<p>and this Mr. Saʿīd, the groom, and this Malīḥa, his wife,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>agreed and fixed between themselves ketubba stipulations according to the law of Moses and the Jews: that if this Saʿīd, the groom, hates this Malīḥa and does not desire her, but wants to separate&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from her, he will pay her all that is written and specified in this ketubba completely. And if this Malīḥa hates this Saʿīd, her husband, and desires to go out&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from his house, she will lose her ketubba money and will take nothing except that which she brought from her fathers&rsquo; house, that alone, and she will go out with the permission of the court and on the authority&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of our lords the rabbis.&nbsp;</p>
