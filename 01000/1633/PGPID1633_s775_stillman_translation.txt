0 my ve[nerab]le Elder and Superior. .. [may God prolong your lif]e, grant you lasting happiness, care for
and protect you. May you not be denied His granting of success. I am writing to you in a state of good health—may you not be deprived of such
a state nor lack God's blessing and "thanks be to God, Lord of all the worlds" in abundance. Your letter arrived ... The pot arrived,
may I never be deprived of your favor, and may God reward you in my stead. Amen. This is to inform you, my Elder, that I have packed nine bales,
in each one three qintars and a third, without packing material and without any madder, as you instructed.
Zuhayr and his brother, and Hiba Ibn al-Khaṭīb were present at the time of the evaluation of the flax. We were not able to weigh
the flax that same day. I estimated its weight as being about ten (i.e. about the weight of ten bales), and I evaluated the worth of the load as being twenty-five dinars, and I saw to it
that it was packed. I sent the canvas for wrapping to Busir, and I had written on it the mark as you instructed in your letter.
[Abū] Saʿīd Khallūf oversaw the writing. Al-Shīrajī packed eight bales and stated that he would weigh
the ten bales. Salāma went to Ashmunayn, but he did not find a ship. He will go the day after my writing this to
Busir in search of one—may God make this matter easy and bring us together with you. Zuhayr's letter
and Ibn al-Khaṭīb's will reach you along with the bales—God willing—apprising you of what has happened.
Please be so advised. In your letters—may God strengthen you—you discuss the matter of the madder plants which 
... the flax ... the flax is of mixed (quality). So if you wish
