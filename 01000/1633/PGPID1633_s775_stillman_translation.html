<li>0 my ve[nerab]le Elder and Superior. .. [may God prolong your lif]e, grant you lasting happiness, care for</li>
<li>and protect you. May you not be denied His granting of success. I am writing to you in a state of good health&mdash;may you not be deprived of such</li>
<li>a state nor lack God's blessing and "thanks be to God, Lord of all the worlds" in abundance. Your letter arrived ... The pot arrived,</li>
<li>may I never be deprived of your favor, and may God reward you in my stead. Amen. This is to inform you, my Elder, that I have packed nine bales,</li>
<li>in each one three qintars and a third, without packing material and without any madder, as you instructed.</li>
<li>Zuhayr and his brother, and Hiba Ibn al-Khaṭīb were present at the time of the evaluation of the flax. We were not able to weigh</li>
<li>the flax that same day. I estimated its weight as being about ten (i.e. about the weight of ten bales), and I evaluated the worth of the load as being twenty-five dinars, and I saw to it</li>
<li>that it was packed. I sent the canvas for wrapping to Busir, and I had written on it the mark as you instructed in your letter.</li>
<li>[Abū] Saʿīd Khallūf oversaw the writing. Al-Shīrajī packed eight bales and stated that he would weigh</li>
<li>the ten bales. Salāma went to Ashmunayn, but he did not find a ship. He will go the day after my writing this to</li>
<li>Busir in search of one&mdash;may God make this matter easy and bring us together with you. Zuhayr's letter</li>
<li>and Ibn al-Khaṭīb's will reach you along with the bales&mdash;God willing&mdash;apprising you of what has happened.</li>
<li>Please be so advised. In your letters&mdash;may God strengthen you&mdash;you discuss the matter of the madder plants which&nbsp;</li>
<li>... the flax ... the flax is of mixed (quality). So if you wish</li>
