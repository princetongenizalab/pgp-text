                        <ol>
<li>O my ve[nerab]le Elder and Superior. .. [may God prolong your lif]e, grant you lasting happiness, care for</li>
<li>and protect you. May you not be denied His granting of success. I am writing to you in a state of good health&mdash;may you not be deprived of such</li>
<li>a state nor lack God's blessing and "thanks be to God, Lord of all the worlds" in abundance. Your letter arrived ... The pot arrived,</li>
<li>may I never be deprived of your favor, and may God reward you in my stead. Amen. This is to inform you, my Elder, that I have packed nine bales,</li>
<li>in each one three qintars and a third, without packing material and without any madder, as you instructed.</li>
<li>Zuhayr and his brother, and Hiba Ibn al-Khaṭīb were present at the time of the evaluation of the flax. We were not able to weigh</li>
<li>the flax that same day. I estimated its weight as being about ten (i.e. about the weight of ten bales), and I evaluated the worth of the load as being twenty-five dinars, and I saw to it</li>
<li>that it was packed. I sent the canvas for wrapping to Busir, and I had written on it the mark as you instructed in your letter.</li>
<li>[Abū] Saʿīd Khallūf oversaw the writing. Al-Shīrajī packed eight bales and stated that he would weigh</li>
<li>the ten bales. Salāma went to Ashmunayn, but he did not find a ship. He will go the day after my writing this to</li>
<li>Busir in search of one&mdash;may God make this matter easy and bring us together with you. Zuhayr's letter</li>
<li>and Ibn al-Khaṭīb's will reach you along with the bales&mdash;God willing&mdash;apprising you of what has happened.</li>
<li>Please be so advised. In your letters&mdash;may God strengthen you&mdash;you discuss the matter of the madder plants which&nbsp;</li>
<li>... the flax ... the flax is of mixed (quality). So if you wish&nbsp;</li>
<li>[to sen]d [me ... ] against that which I have, so that I shall buy more madder, then do it. I have with me twenty-two dinars.</li>
<li>If you wish to send a sum to cover it and that I should collect the madder, then please do so. And if you do not&nbsp;</li>
<li>wish me to buy it for you in partnership nor for myself personally at my own expense, then I shall satisfy your wish in this matter. I have</li>
<li>five bundles of madder plants, they being seventy-five in number and no more. By God, from the day that your letter arrived in which you mentioned</li>
<li>this matter, I have not bought even one batch, as it is my desire in this to satisfy your wish. It is not within me that</li>
<li>I would make any profit which would come to me from this if /you/ yourself would not be pleased. I would not wish such a thing.</li>
<li>Please be so advised. I am progressing with the hatcheling (of the flax) this week which is ending. With me</li>
<li>there is a group (of workers) and every day they increase. We hatchel six or seven bundles a day, and more. Every day the</li>
<li>work increases. May God in His omnipotence make the work easy and help us to complete it. Already</li>
<li>this week lbn al-Ghazaliyya has begun pounding the (madder?) and he has ruined the wages (of the workers) for us. But I regained honor with the hired help</li>
<li>by showing them the dinars [I had with me .... ] And the government financial administrator has also taken some of</li>
<li>lbn al-[ ... ]'s help, .... I have not had any trouble with Yaḥyā at all this week.</li>
<li>Every week he ... and now is the time we have been anticipating.</li>
<li>By God, the small money I had with me is not ... and by God, I had to borrow more than fifteen dinars.</li>
<li>I now have with me only fifty [dir]hems and no more. He (the work foreman) will not hatchel or turn the madder until</li>
<li>he received the workers's wages. And if I keep from paying one individual, he will not hatchel even one madder plant until he received</li>
<li>daily food, and until the wages are settled for the workers. I wish I had the dinars with me</li>
<li>so I could give them to anyone</li>

                        <ol>
<li>If Abu l-Khayr is coming here anyhow, send the necessary money to me with him so I shall not be left penniless&mdash;my state being ruined. The workers are melting way from me.</li>
<li>And if Abu l-Khayr is not coming, either ... with someone else or send</li>
<li>me someone special. Do not fail me. I do not have to enjoin upon you more than this ... the' young man' Jacob the flax to you, but he is</li>
<li>late in going to Fusta[t ... ] And Iqbāl is now completely well, but al-Ḥaṣrī (or the 'young man'?) is not</li>
<li>fit for anything and cannot do [anything ... ] I sent him to someone else</li>
<li>who would come and arrange his affairs ... if I want him to do anything for me and say to him one word, he answers</li>
<li>with ten. Iqbāl will tell you about him, may God protect him; if God is willing, he will reach you and tell some of his miserable doings. He (Iqbāl)</li>
<li>will be coming down with Salāma. and I shall stay as I am unless God should help me. If you do not find anyone to send,</li>
<li>and you think it proper to send the money with Hilāl, then do so. The matter is for you to decide. Please be so advised. I extend to you</li>
<li>my best greetings and to my master Abu 'l-Faḍl&mdash;may God protect him. And my best greetings to my Masters, Abū Sahl and Abū Saʿīd&mdash;</li>
<li>may God watch over them. God is my portion and He is my hope. As to the cloak that you sent to Abraham, he did not</li>
<li>take it, and it is with me.&nbsp;It is not worth a dinar, and it is light. These people like whatever has wool in it. Buy him</li>
<li>a heavy cloak and send it to me because he is ill. And I ask that my Master, the Elder, if he would be so kind as to buy</li>
<li>for me a piece and a half of muthallath cloth produced in Fustat. I will make from it a robe and trousers. The robe which I was wearing&nbsp;</li>
<li>is torn to shreds, and I am wearing just the jubba against my body /for I have not what to wear./ And if it is not convenient to get the cloth, buy for me a garment</li>
<li>and used trousers for a suit from the Sūq al-Ḥammām (Bazaar of the Bath). Do not neglect this. Please be so advised.</li>
<li>In accordance with your request, I have prepared an accounting which will reach you [God willing) either in Hebrew letters in my own handwriting</li>
<li>[or in Arabic] in the handwriting of I[bn a]l-[Khaṭīb (?)] [ ... and p]e[ac]e be with you.</li>
