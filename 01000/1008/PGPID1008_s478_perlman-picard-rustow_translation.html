<li>A case that took place before us&mdash;we the court appointed by the Great Beit Din of the court of our prince and the leader</li>
<li>of our generation, his honor, greatness and holiness, our master and teacher, our lord Shelomo, the sublime, great prince in Israel and Judah,</li>
<li>the valid document (recording it), may it contribute to his exaltation and raise it aloft in holiness, may his crown shine. Thus it was, in the month of Adar, in the year</li>
<li>1450 Sel. in Fustat, Egypt, situated [on the Nile] River: Our master and teacher Aharon&nbsp;</li>
<li>ha-Kohen al-Iskandarānī al-Ḥarīrī (the silker), son of our master Moshe the elder, may his resting place be Eden, and Abū l-Khayr Mevorakh son of Moshe, may his resting place be Eden, [&hellip;]</li>
<li>the tax-farmer of Atfīḥ, appeared before us with a deed in his hand (written) in (the court of) the gentiles the amount of which was 6 dīnārs. He mentioned that he was still owed</li>
<li>the entire sum. There ensued between them matters that it would take a long time to explain, and after all that, he agreed from the&nbsp;</li>
<li>8. [&hellip;] from the abovementioned. They agreed on three dinars, and this Mr. Aharon Ha-Kohen took it [&hellip;.]</li>
<li>9. from this deed and from all claim and request from the beginning of time until now, and he received [&hellip;]</li>
<li>10. dinars with which he was pleased, and it was agreed upon them. We the undersigned made a qinyan f[rom this master and teacher of ours Aharon Ha-Kohen]</li>
<li>11. al-Iskandarānī al-Ḥarīrī son of Mr. Moshe the elder, may his resting place be Eden, to this Abū l-Khayr Mevorakh, a complete and stringent qinyan,</li>
<li>12.&nbsp; with an implement fitting for the performance of a qinyan from that moment, with his consent and with no coercion at all. He has released him from all claims&nbsp;</li>
<li>13. and demands, from the beginning of time up till now. Nothing remains between the two of them whatsoever as a joint enterprise (mu&lsquo;āmala), and he has no claim against him</li>
<li>14. whatsoever. He deprived him of all oaths, simple and grave, even by way of rider oaths (על ידי גלגול) and even herem</li>
<li>15.&nbsp; setam. He received the darak from him regarding this , as (this document) is not like promises and not like formularies but rather (bears) the weight and force&nbsp;</li>
<li>16. of all legal documents of those attentive in the court, so that the force of this document will be exemption. This aforementioned exemption is from the aforementioned deed&nbsp;</li>
<li>17. and from any other deed that should appear to this Abu l-Khayr Mevorakh</li>
<li>18. in the gentile [script?] or a document in the Hebrew script, and from any daman of silk or other things, and from XXX&nbsp; that he is aware of</li>
<li>19. now and not aware of now, whatever it might be or amount to. We performed a qinyan concerning from this Mr. Aharon</li>
<li>20. Ha-Kohan, using the most certain stipulations of qinyan, and with the nullification of any determination and pretext, and then we wrote this [&hellip;]</li>
<li>21. aforementioned so that it would be his right and proof after this day, and everything is proper and enduring. Natan son of Shumuʾel, the friend, may the memory of the righteous be for a blessing [&hellip;]</li>
<li>22. when Sheikh Abu l-Hasan our teacher and rabbi son of Mr. Yaʿaqov the elder, may his resting place be Eden, who is known as Ibn al-ʿIrāqī, damana to this Mr. Aharon son of Moshe</li>
<li>23. the aforementioned three dinars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
