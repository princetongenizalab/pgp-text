<li>of the year 1506 of the documents, corresponding to Dhūʾl-qaʿda</li>
<li>(4-7) of the year 590 of the Arabic calendar, the sum of the rent being 160 dir. This we accepted and rented the said qāʿa to him for the said two years, for 160 dir., as mentioned above. This is a lease that is sound, complete, absolute, decided, and valid, binding on</li>
