To the poor of Old Cairo twenty dinars shall be given.


To Joseph's wife five dinars shall be given.


To each of her two brothers five dinars shall be given.


To an orphan girl in (New) Cairo, a relative of mine, two dinars shall be given.  


All this shall be paid from the debts


against which securities have been given and which are listed in three


documents written in Arabic letters, the securities, as well


as the debts. All the aforementioned


to whom I have willed something shall receive payment from the securities,


as mentioned before. The remaining


securities shall be added to


the cash in gold which I possess, namely three hundred dinars


which are ready with me and sixty seven dinars

and carpets. All this shall be kept for my son on conditions

shall be handed over to him. If, however, God forbid, death


overtakes him before, one half of all this shall be given to the synagogues


in Old Cairo and to the poor in equal halves.


The other half shall be divided between my heirs in equal shares,


to wit, my brother, my sisters, and the daughters (corrected, it seems, to: daughter) of my paternal uncle.


To his (namely, the boy's,) father, Ḥassūn of Ascalon,


not one penny shall be given, except that two promissory notes


concerning a debt of eighty dinars which he owes me, will be handed over to him


in case my son meets his predestined death, in addition to ten


dinars out of the estate of the boy. But the rest is


for the synagogues and the poor in equal shares,


namely one half, and the other half for my family, as I have explained


before.  


The following shall be expended on my funeral


and on my "shrouds": fifty dinars, to be taken from the cash available.


The following shall be bought for me:


A Dabīqī garment for six d., a cloack for six d.,


a Ṭalī 23 cap for two d., a hood for six d.,


a Dabīqī kerchief for two d., a veil for two d.,
