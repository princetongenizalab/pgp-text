                        <p>My lord and master (may God) unite (us) soon under desirable circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have strained my yearnings. Please (mend) soon what you have impaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I ask you a favor? Kindly approach your uncle and your paternal aunt and also the "Head of the Police" Abū Ibrāhīm Ibn Barōn, who values you very much and who is my support - may God make his honored position permanent - that they should talk to Ibn al-Shayyāni with regard to the balance of the pledge made for the imprisoned woman. For we are in trouble with regard to the small balance remaining as we had been with regard to the large sum. The bearer of this letter of mine - may God restore his health - asks you to kindly recommend him to someone who could be of help to him. For he was a man of means and has become the opposite; on top of this, he has lost his health and eyesight and is far away from his family and native country. And God may let you be the originator of every charity and good work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Peace upon my lord and God's mercy.</p>

                        <p>To the illustrious scholar the noble leader our m(aster and) te(acher) Ḥalfōn ha-Levi may the All(merciful) pre(serve him) son of his honor our m(aster and) t(eacher) Nethanel ha-Levi m(ay he rest in) E(den). </p>

                        <h3>Postscript</h3>
                    
                        <p>Convey my highest regards to the illustrious Master (Rāv), the Light of Israel, may the All merciful pr&egrave;serve him, and substitute for me in asking him to reply to the people of Toledo. They rely on me in this matter, and I cannot say that my requests find no friendly response with the Master, may his Rock protect him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And peace upon my lord.</p>
