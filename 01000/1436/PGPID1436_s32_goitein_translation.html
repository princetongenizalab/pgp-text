                        <p>Testimony about what happened in our presence, we the [undersigned witnesses. There appeared before us] the elder Abu ʾl-Faḍl, (his) h(onor), g(reatness), (and) h(oliness), (our) m(aster) and t(eacher) Zadok, the h[onored elder, son of the elder Abū ... h(is) h(onor) etc.] our m(aster) etc. Shemarya, the honored elder, m(ay he rest) i(n) E(den) [and the elder Abū ... , h(is) h(onor) etc.] m(aster) etc. Solomon ha-Levi, the honored elder, (may his) Ro(ck) keep him [son of the elder Abū ... ] Ibn al-Amʾaṭ and his sister from father and mother called [Malīḥa, the widow of Abū&nbsp; Saʾd, may he rest in peace].&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Malīḥa agreed with the elder Abu [ʾI-Faḍl that he would teach her boy] Hiba, the son of the afore-mentioned Abū&nbsp; Saʾd, Arabic script [and arithmetic and that she would pay him] for this exactly 2 dinars of full weight and Fustat coinage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[The condition was that the result of the study] which he undertook to teach him for 2 dinars [as mentioned above, should be that the afore-mentioned Hiba] should be able to write a letter with his own hand without blemish in spelling and [script and without] mistakes in the rendering of the content, but that he should write anything dictated to him in [correct] spelling [and pleasant script and without misunderstanding.]&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to arithmetic, he should master the use of the abacus, the decimals [ ........................ ] and the accounts, not more. It was agreed that the el[der Abu ʾI-Faḍl would receive these 2 dinars] any time he applied for them and that the payment would not be deferred.</p>
<p>[We wrote for him] this document so that it should be a t[estimony in his favor and a proof to be produced in&nbsp;</p>
