Recto


In Thy Name, oh Merciful! 


Solomon, the son of His Honorable and Great Sanctity, our Master and Leader, Ḥayīm, “the seventh of the ḥavūrā”, of holy and blessed memory, declares: I have collected from our Master 


and Leader, Eli ha-Kohen, the faithful parnās, the son of R. Yaḥyā, of blessed memory, 20 good, golden, and weighed dinars 


of Egyptian mint, of the total collected from the compound known as the compound of the qōdesh for the Jerusalemites. 


This sum had been transfered to me on his account by the Rabbanite Jews residing in Jerusalem, the Holy City, after 


I had lent them 20 dinars against it. Now I have collected them and they are mine and nothing is left 


(to my credit) with the people to whom the transfer was made by the Rabbanites of Jerusalem; I released them of it, a release through collection 


and acquittal. And I have herewith written this signature of mine, to serve as an evidence against me, for the above-mentioned people, as from today and onwards, 


and against my heirs after me. This (happened) Monday, the fourth of Adar shēnī of the year 4845 of the creation of the world, in Fustat 

 

of Egypt which is situated on the Nile River. Sound and valid, 


Yākhin b. Nethaneel, may he have a good outcome; Joseph b. R. Samuel, of blessed memory (His name is surrounded by small letters forming the word ha-talmid, "the scholar", which was his title). 


David the nāsī, b. Daniel, the nāsī and gāʾōn.
