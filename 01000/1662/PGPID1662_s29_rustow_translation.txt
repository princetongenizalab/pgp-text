Recto

In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.
I am writing, my lord and master — may God prolong your existance, make eternal your glory, smite your enemies, protect me 
from all evil, redeem you and inscribe you for wellbeing and health, praise be to God, lord of the universe — longing for you, may God bring us together
in the happiest of circumstances in his benificence. Your letter arrived, my lord, at the moment when they set sail (Goitein: the Nile ships) after
they had said it was lost. I took it so hard that when it arrived, I felt no relief. I attached no importance to ...
You mentioned that the letter didn't reach you until Sunday at noon. This is the deed of Farjūn, may God banish
his name and cut short his days (on earth), since he's the one who craeted this situation for me. When they (the ships) arrived
on Friday at noon, he took the letter, but If only he had let them alone, curse him (al-malʿūn), to work in their usual fashion (ʿalā rasmihim). But instead, he
wanted to conduct his dealings as if he were working together with me until he loaded his goods — may God curse him today and every day!
You wrote that some of the honey was missing, but you did not write which jars were full and which were less full — full to the brim
like the previous ones, up to their necks. I asked you to inform me whether the sacks containing the wax
that was sent with Qūrīl had five pieces of wax or not. Please sell everything however you can (at whatever price you can obtain).
Don't neglect anything. As for what my lord mentioned on the matter of the mulḥam (cloth), the [ ], and the rest of it, we spoke about this at length, and (now) you're coming back
to it. I would buy it for a dirham and sell it for three.

Verso

You mention that Farjūn, may God curse him, indicated that you shouldn't buy it. I swear by my life, now he's an expert in trade?!
The ship's crew didn't let any of my items go missing at all. They were delighted to get rid of me, so don't worry. Let me know
if the first jars of honey were full up to the neck and the latter ones up to their heads. Please, my lord, sell this 
wax and honey and the ..., and let me know the accounting and about the clothing. I send best wishes to my lord.
If money comes in, send the account with it, as well as the other things, the large sacks, the locks, and ream (dast) of Damascus paper and the goods, if possible.
