                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.</li>
<li>I am writing, my lord and master &mdash; may God prolong your existance, make eternal your glory, smite your enemies, protect me&nbsp;</li>
<li>from all evil, redeem you and inscribe you for wellbeing and health, praise be to God, lord of the universe &mdash; longing for you, may God bring us together</li>
<li>in the happiest of circumstances in his benificence. Your letter arrived, my lord, at the moment when they set sail (Goitein: the Nile ships) after</li>
<li>they had said it was lost, and I took it very hard. When it arrived, there was no relief in it. I attached no importance to ...</li>
<li>You mentioned that the letter didn't reach you until Sunday at noon. This is the deed of Farjūn, may God banish</li>
<li>his name and cut short his days (on earth). He is the one who delayed me until noon with all this sluggishness when they (the ships) arrived.</li>
<li>on Friday at noon. He took the letter. If only he had left/let them, curse him (al-malʿūn), since they were working on their account (ʿalā rasmihim). But instead, he</li>
<li>wanted to conduct his dealings on the pretense that he was working on my account until he loaded his goods. May God curse him today and every day.</li>
<li>You wrote that the honey was missing, but you did not write whether the jars were full or missing, full to the brim</li>
<li>like the previous ones, up to their necks. I asked you to inform me whether the sacks containing the wax</li>
<li>that was sent with Qūrīl had five pieces of wax or not. I would like to ask you, please, to sell everything however you can (at whatever price you can obtain)</li>
<li>Don't neglect anything. What my lord mentioned in the matter of the mulḥam (cloth) and the [ ], the message [or the threads?] in it are long. It was reiterated</li>
<li>to him that I would buy it for a dirham and sell for two-thirds (of a dinar).</li>

                        <ol>
<li>You mention that Farjūn, may God curse him, indicated that you should not buy it. I swear by my life, he is an expert in trade?!</li>
<li>The ship's crew didn't delay me at all. They packed in my things and were done with it, so don't worry. Let me know</li>
<li>if the first jars of honey were full up to the neck and the latter ones up to their heads. Please, my lord, sell this&nbsp;</li>
<li>wax and honey and the ..., and let me know the accounting and the quantity. I read the finest greeetings to my lord.</li>
<li>If money comes in, send this account, the other (accounts), the sacks, the locks, and ream (dast) of Damascus paper and the good, if possible.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso - address</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>[To] my lord and master Abū Bishr and Abū Yaʿaqov, may God lengthen their existence and make their glory eternal,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Yaʿaqov ibn Yūsuf and Yūsuf ibn Yaʿaqov. From Yiṣḥaq Ibn Janūn.</li>
