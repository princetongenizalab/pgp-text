                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>&hellip; with an attractive young girl. The Jews here do not</li>
<li>treat me as a stranger. I have no means for the voyage to you (plural). We are</li>
<li>three persons and I am afraid we might be a burden on you (plural), in particular,</li>
<li>since the good news you broached to me was only that you w111 not need me &mdash; may <i>the H(oly one),</i><i> </i><i>b(lessed be) h(e),</i> let you never</li>
<li>be in need of anyone except himself. Despite my blindness and utmost physical weakness,</li>
<li>which has befallen me in these foreign parts, I am not lost.</li>
<li>At the reverse, I am in a thousand states of prosperity. Praise be to God who provides me with sustenance</li>
<li>in his kindness. I am beloved here and honored by all God-fearing,</li>
<li>intelligent, and educated persons. Nothing, though, has remained with me</li>
<li>except my tongue and my brain. I am able to listen in my room to the sounds of the synagogue service,</li>
<li>when it is conducted by a cantor on Friday nights, Saturday mornings and evenings.</li>
<li>And although the community in Salonika contains</li>
<li>fine scholarly people, no one yet has been able to catch me at</li>
<li>an error in the discussion <i>of civil</i><i> </i><i>or criminal law</i> or any</li>
<li>other of the sciences. In short, I have no grief except the separation from you.</li>
<li>You conjure me in your letter in the name of God, saying: "The moment you</li>
<li>have read this letter do not tarry any longer, but come." Please,</li>
<li>do not write such a thing again, for I am yearning for you a thousand times more</li>
<li>than you do for me, but I have no strength. I cannot tell you, my boy,</li>
<li>how happy I was with the letter of your brother-in-law Abu 'l-Ḥasan,</li>
<li>for I learned from it that he comes from</li>
<li>a fine family. You are having a good company in him, and although in your other brother-in-law &mdash;</li>
<li>although I have not yet received a letter from him &mdash; and with</li>
<li>your sisters, your mother and with my daughter, may God keep her,</li>
<li>and the family of your father-in-law. Greet them all</li>
<li>and their children from me. <i>May </i><i>they all be bles</i><i>ed </i><i>by the H(oly one), b(lessed </i><i>be) h(e), </i></li>
<li><i>and gain fame and pr</i><i>ogeny. </i>My boy Ismaʿīl,</li>
<li>I was informed that in the year 48 the Nile not reach its standard height. I was terrified and had no</li>
<li>rest either by day or by night. <i>By God,</i> make an effort and write</li>
<li>me about your well-being, also who is your other brother-in-law</li>
<li>and how does each of you gain his livelihood. Give my best regards</li>
<li>to your father-in-law and let me know which rank he has among the "members."</li>
<li>Send your letter to ʿImrān b. Nahum in Alexandria,</li>
<li>and he will forward it to me. The address: To Saloniki,</li>
<li>the Upper Synagogue, the House of Shabbetay, the son of M. Moses,</li>
<li>Meṭākala, the Head (of the congregation). My boy, I conjure you in the name of God,</li>
<li>do not neglect the pursuit of knowledge. I am also astonished about you that you [ ... ]</li>

                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li> </li>
<li>My boy, God is my witness that, in the beginning,</li>
<li>I could not come back to you because I had not the necessary means. All of you know</li>
<li>that whenever I had accumulated some sums I did not leave one penny with me,</li>
<li>but spent everything on you (plural), because I loved you and had mercy with you. Secondly, I wished</li>
<li>to bury my bones in the Holy City, for out of this desire</li>
<li>I had left the inheritance of the house of my fathers and separated from them. But that was at a time</li>
<li>of which God disapproved. Therefore, it is now twenty six years since I left</li>
<li>you and did not find rest in any place for thirty months, and I had never</li>
<li>enough money for traveling back to you. I learned also that</li>
<li>... , the paternal uncle of Joseph, perished in a fire, he and all those that were with him;</li>
<li>when I left you, you had a partnership with him. At that time, my means dwindled because of the many expesnes</li>
<li>and I saw no hope for me any more in the lands of Islam. The fourth girl died.</li>
<li>The Turks swept over the eastern parts of the land of the Romans and I fled</li>
<li>before them hurriedly to the western part. My eyesight began to fail and constantly worsened</li>
<li>in the course of five years. After this I did not think that there remained with me p [… ]</li>
<li>for this girl that is with me,</li>
<li>although many</li>
<li>young men have asked her hand, and she did not accept any one of them. Now</li>
<li>your letter and that of your brother-in-law Abu 'l-Ḥasan have arrived and you ask me</li>
<li>not to tarry a moment after having seen your letters. But</li>
<li>I have not strength enough</li>
<li>to walk from my room to the door of the house without being supported and am</li>
<li>generally in a poor state, being hard of hearing and of utmost frailty. If you would see me you would run away</li>
<li>a month’s walking distance. And consider the enormous perils</li>
<li>of the voyage, its expenses, my fright because of my high age and</li>
<li>my solicitude for that who is with me, although she wishes to travel. Do not oppose me in this</li>
<li>matter. I am also afraid of becoming a burden on you, I and my family.</li>
<li>For you know it is not my nature to save money, but when</li>
<li>I have some, I consume it. By God, my boy, do not suspect</li>
<li>anything <i>and </i><i>do </i><i>not think evil </i><i>of the ways of the Creator.</i> </li>
<li>Do not pay attention to the talk of a group that has traveled from </li>
<li>here to your place and of which even the most important men among them have been afflicted </li>
<li>by doctrines that I am ashamed to mention orally, let alone in writing. My son, </li>
<li>rely on your own judgment and on what you have learned. When you were a boy of thirteen years </li>
<li>you dazzled the people by your brilliant mind. Do you not know that these are heavenly things </li>
<li>in which no one has a share? Take a lesson from what happened to your sisters and </li>
<li>to </li>
<li>you in Cairo. Did you perish or even your possessions? Greetings of p[eace].</li>
