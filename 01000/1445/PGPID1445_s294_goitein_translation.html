                        <ol>
<li>In (Your name, o) Me(rciful).&nbsp;</li>
<li>And we pray for the life of our lord, the g(reat) k(ing), //</li>
<li>the prince of the sons of Kedar, our master and lord, the Imām // al-Āmir bī'aḥ(kām) Allāh, the Commander of the F(aithful) and for his sons, the r(oyal family),</li>
<li>and all persons of his e(ntourage), who serve the k(ing) out of love and wa(ge)</li>
<li>w(ar) f(or him) against his e(nemies). May G(od) &mdash; m(ay He be) p(raised) - help them and help us; may He subdue</li>
<li>their foes and ours; and may He fill their hearts with kindness t(owards us)</li>
<li>and towards all His people, the house of Is(rael), and let us s(ay) Amen.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Blessed be the memory of those whose souls rest in peace, namely, the Gaons of Israel, the heads</li>
<li>of their yeshivas, their chief judges, their scholars</li>
<li>and public leaders, who have ruled over the people of the Lord of Hosts</li>
<li>in fairness and integrity prior to our present lord and Gaon, namely...</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>... And may life, p(eace) and honor,</li>
<li>longevity and fulfillment of all wishes, an auspicious star</li>
<li>and all of the blessings pr(onounced) by the prophets be granted to</li>
<li>his h(onor), g(reatness), and h(oliness), (our) m(aster and) t(eacher), our lord and Gaon Maṣlīaḥ, the High Priest,</li>
<li>the head of the yeshiva "Geon Ya'aqov," the honored and revered.</li>
<li>May God bless him and make him great...</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>may He prolong his rule until the coming of the f(irst) kingdom.</li>
<li>In his time Judah will be saved and</li>
<li>Israel dwell securely. May God crown him with a crown of might.</li>
<li>May He grant that he find favor in the eyes of the king and of the great</li>
<li>and of all that see him. May our God bless also all Israel, // its heads, //</li>
<li>scholars, judges, learned men and notables,</li>
<li>here and in all the</li>
<li>settlements to which they have fled</li>
<li>in their exile, when they were forced to leave the land of their love and dwell</li>
<li>in countries not theirs, in East and West, North and South.</li>
<li>May He call out to gather us in and shorten our sufferings,</li>
<li>to fulfill that which is written...&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>...May our God bless</li>
<li>everyone in this h(oly) congregation, old and</li>
<li>young, with all the blessings pronounced by the prophets; may He bless, k(eep) and h(elp) them, and may He answer them, before</li>
<li>they call, as it is written,</li>
<li>"Before they call, I shall answer them," together with all Israel), and let us s(ay) Amen.&nbsp;</li>
