Recto
In the second decade of the month of Adar, in the year 1555 of the era of the documents, in the town of Little Damīra, which is situated on the Nile river, there appeared before us the elder Abu ʾl-Fakhr, son of Abu ʾl-Faraj, m(ay he rest in) E(den). The symbolic purchase was made from him in the proper form … to the effect that he would in no way interfere with the expenditure made by the public chest for the hiring of riding beasts for our lord, the prince Joshia, which were hired for his travel to Ashmūm and al Maḥalla. In case Abu ʾl-Fakhr interferes with the proposed expenditure, he has to pay a penalty to the public chest. He hereby renounced his claim in connection with the reading of the Esther scroll by his son Ibrahīm, after Umm Abu ʾl-Surūr and her daughter had paid forty silver dirhems to the public chest, stipulating that the community should spend the money for any purpose connected with the synagogue, as agreed upon by the community. These forty dirhems were paid by Umm Abu ʾl-Surūr and her daughter, the wife of Ben Umm ʾAmid, for the privilege of reading the Esther scroll by the aforementioned Ibrahīm, son of Abu ʾl-Fakhr. We wrote this down and signed it and everything is hereby ratified, confirmed and valid.
