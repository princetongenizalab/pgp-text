                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <p>You also mentioned that a teacher in your place instructs the boys with out (first teaching them) the alphabet and the vowel signs. This is by no means permissible, for the alphabet and the vowel signs are the basis of all teaching; through the alphabet, God has given us His message; through it, the pupils get a firm grounding; and on it, everything rests. Indeed, reading with a boy without first teaching him the alphabet and the vowel signs is of no avail and of no use. Therefore, if the facts are as you reported, please instruct that teacher to act according to this letter and to teach methodically, if he wants to be a teacher of Jewish children. Please act on all points dealt with in this letter in a way which will justify you before God, and report back about any action taken. May your welfare and that of the community increase and never decrease, etc.</p>
