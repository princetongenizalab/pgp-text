                        <p>In (your) name, O Merci(ful).</p>
<p>My lord, dear and noble brother, may God prolong your life, keep and preserve you and never deprive me of you.</p>
<p>I had been living here in Ascalon in six thousand states of wellbeing, thanks to the beneficfence of God, the exalted, when Musallam b. Abī Sahl approached me. I went with him up to Nablus and bought for him his sister. A debt of 60 dinars remained on me, and he entreated me saying: "I ask you by God, let me bring her up to Fustat. She might be able to obtain part of her ransom."</p>
<p>Now he is gone and has disappeared, leaving me with a debt of 60 dinars. The Frank came to me, and I was looking for someone granting me a loan , but was not successful with anyone.</p>
<p>Then I presented my boy as a collateral against a loan on interest, but no one was prepared to take him as a collateral. It seems, there has not remained here anyone who believes that one is permitted to do a good work.</p>
<p>I ask you now to be so kind and to talk to Muaallam and to tell him not to keep me any longer in abeyance; he should send me either the money or the girl. Approach him from any possible avenue and bring him to the (Jewish) courts. [ ... ] you know that I do not possess either [ ... ] Kindest regards to you and to your sons [also. Please] take urgent action in this matter for [ . ] I wish to be on good terms with the creditor. And your wellbeing may increase.</p>
<p>Address: </p>
<p>To Bilbays, to his honor, my dear brother, the elder Abu 'l-Bahā Ibn Ghanāʾim</p>
<p>From his brother, who kissses his handa, Abū Saʿd Ibn Ghanāʾim</p>
