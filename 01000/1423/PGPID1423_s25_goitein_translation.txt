Goitein
In (your) name, O Merci(ful).
My lord, dear and noble brother, may God prolong your life, keep and preserve you and never deprive me of you.
I had been living here in Ascalon in six thousand states of wellbeing, thanks to the beneficfence of God, the exalted, when Musallam b. Abī Sahl approached me. I went with him up to Nablus and bought for him his sister. A debt of 60 dinars remained on me, and he entreated me saying: "I ask you by God, let me bring her up to Fustat. She might be able to obtain part of her ransom."
Now he is gone and has disappeared, leaving me with a debt of 60 dinars. The Frank came to me, and I was looking for someone granting me a loan , but was not successful with anyone.
Then I presented my boy as a collateral against a loan on interest, but no one was prepared to take him as a collateral. It seems, there has not remained here anyone who believes that one is permitted to do a good work.
I ask you now to be so kind and to talk to Muaallam and to tell him not to keep me any longer in abeyance; he should send me either the money or the girl. Approach him from any possible avenue and bring him to the (Jewish) courts. [ ... ] you know that I do not possess either [ ... ] Kindest regards to you and to your sons [also. Please] take urgent action in this matter for [ . ] I wish to be on good terms with the creditor. And your wellbeing may increase.
