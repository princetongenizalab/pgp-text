(1-2) .... (your) servant recognizes the wide beneficences and (your) name as benefactor. And may He, His Name be praised, make that (you) our Master
 
(3-4) be solicited rather than a solicitor. Your servant appeals in the matter of a man who verily is a God fearing man and applies for the sake of bringing about what is good and beneficent. Now,
 
it is out of constraint that I bring to your knowledge my  situation, and the way it was handled. Your servant
has lived in the compound that is in the vicinity of the Synagogue, may it be rebuilt and reconstructed, for 13
years, for 12 (dir.) a month. I hold (a deed with) the signature of al-Nāgīd, our Master
David, may His Honor increase, in which he stipulates that I inhabit
it for the specified rent. There is an explanation in it whose formulation is long
(10-11) so that it would take me too long to present it here. To put it briefly, in it he said that it is in the public interest that al-Melammēd should live in the above mentioned compound without any rent at all; and then,
 
due to his critical situation, the heqdēsh will be satisfied with 12 (dir.) a month,
to ease his distress with, and (to enable him) to watch these few children of Israel
