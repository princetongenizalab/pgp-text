<li>(1-2) .... (your) servant recognizes the wide beneficences and (your) name as benefactor. And may He, His Name be praised, make that (you) our Master</li>
<li> </li>
<li>(3-4) be solicited rather than a solicitor. Your servant appeals in the matter of a man who verily is a God fearing man and applies for the sake of bringing about what is good and beneficent. Now,</li>
<li> </li>
<li>it is out of constraint that I bring to your knowledge my  situation, and the way it was handled. Your servant</li>
<li>has lived in the compound that is in the vicinity of the Synagogue, may it be rebuilt and reconstructed, for 13</li>
<li>years, for 12 (dir.) a month. I hold (a deed with) the signature of al-Nāgīd, our Master</li>
<li>David, may His Honor increase, in which he stipulates that I inhabit</li>
<li>it for the specified rent. There is an explanation in it whose formulation is long</li>
<li>(10-11) so that it would take me too long to present it here. To put it briefly, in it he said that it is in the public interest that al-Melammēd should live in the above mentioned compound without any rent at all; and then,</li>
<li> </li>
<li>due to his critical situation, the heqdēsh will be satisfied with 12 (dir.) a month,</li>
<li>to ease his distress with, and (to enable him) to watch these few children of Israel</li>
</ol>
