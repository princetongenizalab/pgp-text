Testimony about what took place in our presence, we the witnesses signed 


below on this deed of disclaimer: A son of B appeared before us 


and declared before us, "My masters! Know that I am deposing 


a disclaimer before you that C daughter of D, my wife, possesses


 {the daughter }of a gentile slave girl, a minor who grew up in our house. 


And she wants to free her and emancipate her. But I do not want and do not desire to free [her].


Now when she pressed me with her words, I had to mislead her 


and to act according to her wishes and to mislead the daughter of her slave girl, whose name is 


X, (to think) that I am making her a free woman. But it is not my will nor 


my desire to free her nor to emancipate her. The deed 


of emancipation which I have written for her is void and is like a potsherd 


thrown in the street which is worthless and is not to be relied upon at all. 


And with this intention I have deposed my words before you. Write 


for me (a deed of) evidence." So we wrote for him this disclaimer and we signed (it) and gave (it) to h[im], for it to be in the possession 


 of A son of B as evidence and as proof. Ratified, confirmed and valid. 


And this took place on the Xth day, such and such of the month Y.
