                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Testimony about what took place in our presence, we the witnesses signed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>below on this deed of disclaimer: A son of B appeared before us&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and declared before us, "My masters! Know that I am deposing&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a disclaimer before you that C daughter of D, my wife, possesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;{the daughter }of a gentile slave girl, a minor who grew up in our house.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And she wants to free her and emancipate her. But I do not want and do not desire to free [her].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now when she pressed me with her words, I had to mislead her&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and to act according to her wishes and to mislead the daughter of her slave girl, whose name is&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>X, (to think) that I am making her a free woman. But it is not my will nor&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my desire to free her nor to emancipate her. The deed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of emancipation which I have written for her is void and is like a potsherd&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thrown in the street which is worthless and is not to be relied upon at all.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And with this intention I have deposed my words before you. Write&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for me (a deed of) evidence." So we wrote for him this disclaimer and we signed (it) and gave (it) to h[im], for it to be in the possession&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;of A son of B as evidence and as proof. Ratified, confirmed and valid.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And this took place on the Xth day, such and such of the month Y.</p>
</li>
</ol>
