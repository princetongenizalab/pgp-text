<ol><li>This is a copy of the will of Khulla bt. Shabbat which was brought before <i>the court,</i> with everything</li>
<li>contained therein, written in the hand of Yehuda son of the <i>scribe.</i> We copied it</li>
<li>&nbsp;with its plene and defectiva spelling and its witnesses <i>letter by letter,</i></li>
<li><i>and word by word</i>.<i> Testimony that took place in our presence, we the under[s]igned, as follows:</i></li>
<li>We came into the presence of Khūlla bt. Shabbāt and she said to us, bear witness for me with all the (necessary) firm words and</li>
<li>types of testimony that I affirm before you that I possess one-third</li>
<li>of a house in the Fortress of the Candles (Qaṣr al-Shamaʿ) in partnership with my brothers, and one-third of a house next to the funduq (inn) of al-Dhahabi</li>
<li>in partnership with the son of her sister, and 2 2/3 of the house of the Ikshadiyya in partnership with her brothers.</li>
<li>She also has a ghulām (slave, business agent) who is to be sold, the proceeds to be divided equally, one-half for the upkeep of</li>
<li>Dammūh and the other half to remain with <i>the court</i> designated for someone who d[i]es impoverished</li>
<li>or to a person who gets detained on account of the poll tax and has not the wherewithal to extricate himself. We made to her the suggesion</li>
<li>of the Diadem,<i> may his Rock [God] preserve him, </i>"the Diadem of the Scholars," that in the synagogue of the Iraqis and in that of the</li>
<li>Palestinians there is a Bible codex wort[h] a certain sum. We suggested that (the money) be designated for its restoration, but she said</li>
<li>"No." She acquitted her brothers of all claims and demands, they being as <i>trustworthy</i></li>
<li><i>as two reputable witnesses</i>. She stated that she owes the son of her sister 7 1/2 dinars</li>
<li>and (another) 4 dinars. The 7 1/2 should be repaid from the sum recieved by her heirs,</li>
<li>[and the] 4 [di]nars from the sum (recieved by) her two sisters. She also stated that she owes her slave</li>
<li>2 dinars, and 6 dinars to the daughter of her brother Abū ʿAlī al-Kohen. We performed the <i>qinyan</i> with</li>
<li>her brothers that they would stand surety fort the 12 dinars &hellip;</li>
<li>from the sum apportioned to them in the inheritance,<i> and peace</i>. Yeshuʿa haKohen b. ʿAlī, <i>may his soul be bound in the bundle of life</i></li>
<li>Yehuda b. Shlomo <i>the scrib</i>e,<i> may his soul dwell in prosperity and his descendants inherit the earth</i>. This constiutes everything contained</li>
