<ol><li>This is a copy of the will of Khulla bt. Shabbāt which was brought before us at the court. The following </li>
<li>comprises what was written in the hand of Yehuda son of the scribe (<i>sofer</i>), which we have transferred regarding</li>
<li>what she with[out???] additions and deletions, <i>letter by letter,</i></li>
<li><i>and word by word</i>.<i> [The following is] testimony </i>that came before us<i>, the witnesses that have signed below</i>. </li>
<li>Khūlla bt. Shabbāt said to us, “Bear witness for me testify on my own behalf through all the expressions</li>
<li>of the court and all the types of testimony that I report to you that I own a third</li>
<li>of a dār in Qaṣr al-Shamaʿa in partnership with my sisters, and a third of a dār next to the funduq al-dhahabi (“the gold hotel”)</li>
<li>in partnership with her sister’s son, and two qirāts and two ḥabbas [=2/24+2/72=0.11] in partnership with her sisters the Ikshadiyya dār.</li>
<li>And she owns an enslaved boy who is to be sold, and his price is to be divided in equal halves: half for the</li>
<li>Dammuh pilgrimage and the other half to remain with the court [as charity] to pay death expenses for someone who has nothing</li>
<li>or for people who are on the hook for taxes and don’t have anything because of it. We (the witnesses) relayed to her what</li>
<li>was said by the Diadem,<i> may his Rock [God] preserve him, Nezer haḤaverim</i>, that in the synagogue of the Iraqis and the</li>
<li>Palestinians there are books [bibles?] whose price is everything. And we said to her that [she could pay] the price of restoring them. But she said</li>
<li>no. Then she freed her sisters from any [future] lawsuits or claims, [declaring] them as trustworthy</li>
<li>as two kosher witnesses. And she acknowledged that she owes the son of her sister seven and a half dinars</li>
<li>and four of the dinars should be paid from her heirs, and the seven and a half dinars</li>
<li>and the four dinars should be retrieved from her two sisters. And she acknowledged that she owes her slave</li>
<li>two dinars. And six dinars to the daughter of her brother Abū ʿAlī al-Kohen. And we made a <i>qinyan</i> with</li>
<li>her sisters that they would be the guarantors (<i>ḍamūn darak</i>) for the aforementioned twelve dinars…</li>
<li>of the whole and what they need to get from her heirs. <i>And peace</i>. Yeshuʿa haKohen b. ʿAlī, <i>may his soul be bound in the bundle of the living</i></li>
<li>Yehuda b. Shlomo <i>the scrib</i>e. And we checked that this was everything she had</li>
<li>in the aforementioned will and we had it before us and ensured it is correct — <i>letter [by letter and word by word.</i>]</li></ol>
