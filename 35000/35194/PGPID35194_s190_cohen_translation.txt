This is a copy of the will of Khulla bt. Shabbāt which was brought before us at the court. The following 
comprises what was written in the hand of Yehuda son of the scribe (sofer), which we have transferred regarding
what she with[out???] additions and deletions, letter by letter,
and word by word. [The following is] testimony that came before us, the witnesses that have signed below. 
Khūlla bt. Shabbāt said to us, “Bear witness for me testify on my own behalf through all the expressions
of the court and all the types of testimony that I report to you that I own a third
of a dār in Qaṣr al-Shamaʿa in partnership with my sisters, and a third of a dār next to the funduq al-dhahabi (“the gold hotel”)
in partnership with her sister’s son, and two qirāts and two ḥabbas [=2/24+2/72=0.11] in partnership with her sisters the Ikshadiyya dār.
And she owns an enslaved boy who is to be sold, and his price is to be divided in equal halves: half for the
Dammuh pilgrimage and the other half to remain with the court [as charity] to pay death expenses for someone who has nothing
or for people who are on the hook for taxes and don’t have anything because of it. We (the witnesses) relayed to her what
was said by the Diadem, may his Rock [God] preserve him, Nezer haḤaverim, that in the synagogue of the Iraqis and the
Palestinians there are books [bibles?] whose price is everything. And we said to her that [she could pay] the price of restoring them. But she said
no. Then she freed her sisters from any [future] lawsuits or claims, [declaring] them as trustworthy
as two kosher witnesses. And she acknowledged that she owes the son of her sister seven and a half dinars
and four of the dinars should be paid from her heirs, and the seven and a half dinars
and the four dinars should be retrieved from her two sisters. And she acknowledged that she owes her slave
two dinars. And six dinars to the daughter of her brother Abū ʿAlī al-Kohen. And we made a qinyan with
her sisters that they would be the guarantors (ḍamūn darak) for the aforementioned twelve dinars…
of the whole and what they need to get from her heirs. And peace. Yeshuʿa haKohen b. ʿAlī, may his soul be bound in the bundle of the living
Yehuda b. Shlomo the scribe. And we checked that this was everything she had
in the aforementioned will and we had it before us and ensured it is correct — letter [by letter and word by word.]
