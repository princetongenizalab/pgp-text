Would the Shaykh al-WatÄ«q, may God preserve him, enter (the town)
so that the meeting may be convened with him
on the Sabbath in the presence of the elders,
and it will be decided what is to be done. And may his welfare
increase! As for his note,
it arrived too wet
to be read.

Margin

It is particularly important that you not come late. Greetings.
