<li>Would the Shaykh al-WatÄ«q, may God preserve him, enter (the town)</li>
<li>so that the meeting may be convened with him</li>
<li>on the Sabbath in the presence of the elders,</li>
<li>and it will be decided what is to be done. And may his welfare</li>
<li>increase! As for his note,</li>
<li>it arrived too wet</li>
<li>to be read.</li>
</ol>
