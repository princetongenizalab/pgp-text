                        <ol><li>Proceedings (of what) took place before us—we, the undersigned witnesses—Abraham ha-Kohen b. Daniel</li><li>//and Obadiah// ‘Abd Allah b. Meshullam al-Ṣūrī came before us after the (court) session which [they] attended […] … between the two of them</li><li>and settled what was between the two of them on the condition that each of them would take the […]  from the stock between the two of them […]</li><li>//between the two of them// twenty dinars from the two of them, and //Obadiah// ‘Abd Allah said that with […] …</li><li>the joint enterprise (mu‘āmala) which they had in it, and on the condition that … the right of ‘Abd Allah […] … from</li><li>these partners was upon him and upon this Abū Sa‘d his partner //equally.// Furthermore, if there was a surplus, it would be for the two of them</li><li>equally. Then M(r.) Abraham ha-Kohen b. Daniel said to us, “Testify on my behalf, and perform a qinyan with me effective immediately</li><li>using all the language of claims, write and sign and give it to this Obadiah b. Meshullam my partner, in order that he would have proof</li><li>and a legal claim effective immediately. This happened in accordance with my free will, not under duress or compulsion, nor the like from any</li><li>of the factors which nullify testimony, but rather with a full heart and a desirous spirit, I attest before you that I have settled (my) account with him in</li><li>[…] … dinar.  I, Abraham ha-Kohen, have received </li><li>… which is that … from this aforemen[tioned] twenty dinars</li><li>which are allocated to me from this stock … and I have no (further right) therein (to claim) from him, … nor any claim, and he terminated me …</li><li>… work from today onward on his behalf, I have no claim upon him in this dispute, nor claim nor any demand concerning all</li><li>the causes and reasons neither //in that which// he has transacted therein, nor in that which he has worked therein in the production of weaving …</li><li>And now each of us will work and labor for himself. I have taken upon myself—I, (Abraham b.) Daniel ha-Kohen, responsibility for this ten dinars,</li><li>upon myself and upon my heirs after me, for M(r.) Obadiah b. Meshullam and his heirs after him, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions</li><li>which may be made for me and which I have made concerning this document, as a decree of the Sages, for this is not like promises and not like formularies, but rather</li><li>(bears) the weight and force of all documents of the court which the Sages decreed and which are generally employed effective immediately. We performed a qinyan wi[th Abraham]</li><li>ha-Kohen b. Daniel and with M(r.) Obadiah b. Meshullam, concerning everything written and specified above. Proper and enduring. That [which]</li><li>happened before us, we wrote and signed //on Thursday, the twenty-third day of the month of Tammuz, of the year one thousand three hundred// and we gave it to M(r.) Obadiah b. Meshullam, that he would have a title of right and proof from [now on.] </li><li>I attest before you that I have settled (my) account with him … which was with us … total […]</li><li>and I have received that which is allocated to me from this stock, which is ten dinars. I have absolved him o[f …]</li><li>And now, each of us will work //from today// onward on his own behalf. I have no dispute, nor a claim, nor any claim concerning all conc[erning] all that he has done</li><li>for any cause or reason, neither in that which he transacts therein, nor in that which he partners therein, since we have separated,</li><li>each of us working for himself, for profit or loss. I have taken upon myself—I, Obadiah b. Meshullam, respon[sibility for]</li><li>the aforementioned ten dinars, upon myself and upon my heirs after me.</li></ol>
