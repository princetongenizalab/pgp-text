To my master, the mighty vizier, the sincere and intimate friend of the commander of the faithful, may God cause his exaltation to endure and crush his enemies,


belongs the lofty resolution regarding that, if God wills.


Praise be to God and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and upon his gracious and pure family, and save them.


Our sufficiency [is God, what a fine keeper is he!]
