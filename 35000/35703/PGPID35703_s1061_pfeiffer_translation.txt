What does our master and teacher, rabbi Yiṣḥaq [b. Sasson] the judge, the mighty hammer and the flag of the rabbis, may he live, say 


about a Jew who was in partnership with a non-Jew for some years who took the profit of the partnership (muʿāmala), keeping it 


from the Jew. Then, he wrote a document (ḥujja) against him, putting an end to 


his partnership. The Jew threatened to imprison him so as to force the non-Jew to give him back the amount he took.


The Jew gathered against him the old and the new debits and had them drawn up in a Jewish legal document (sheṭar) in a Jewish court (beit din),


mentioning the totality of the amounts. The Jew made a new complete calculation; the entirety of the partnership was thus contained in


the document.         Teach us, may his rock protect him, (1) whether if the non-Jew sues the Jew in the beit 


din and accuses him using the shetar as his documentation, it is permissible or not for the Jew to deny [the validity of] the shetar, (2) and [whether he can] oblige 


the non-Jew to take an oath swearing that he doesn’t owe the other person any additional money on account of the prohibition on interest (ribit) that he 


claims, (3) and whether a punishment (onesh) can be imposed on him or not on account of the oath, and whatever should be done on this question.


May his reward be doubled from heaven.
