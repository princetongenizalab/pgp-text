<p>What does our master and teacher, rabbi Yiṣḥaq [b. Sasson] the judge, the mighty hammer and the flag of the rabbis, may he live, say&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about a Jew who was in partnership with a non-Jew for some years who took the profit of the partnership (muʿāmala), keeping it&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from the Jew. Then, he wrote a document (ḥujja) against him, putting an end to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his partnership. The Jew threatened to imprison him so as to force the non-Jew to give him back the amount he took.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Jew gathered against him the old and the new debits and had them drawn up in a Jewish legal document (sheṭar) in a Jewish court (beit din),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentioning the totality of the amounts. The Jew made a new complete calculation; the entirety of the partnership was thus contained in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the document. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Teach us, may his rock protect him, (1) whether if the non-Jew sues the Jew in the beit&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>din and accuses him using the shetar as his documentation, it is permissible or not for the Jew to deny [the validity of] the shetar, (2) and [whether he can] oblige&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the non-Jew to take an oath swearing that he doesn&rsquo;t owe the other person any additional money on account of the prohibition on interest (ribit) that he&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>claims, (3) and whether a punishment (onesh) can be imposed on him or not on account of the oath, and whatever should be done on this question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May his reward be doubled from heaven.</p>
</li>
</ol>
