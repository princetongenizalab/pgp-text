Ṣedaqa the Elder (who) r(ests in) E(den,) agent of the Elder Sayyid al-Kull M(r.) Moses the Elder b. Obadiah the Ḥazzan, known as (I)bn al-Ḥallā’ (who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us—we, the undersigned—</li><li>and said to us after he presented to the court a verified agency (agreement) from the aforementioned Sayyid al-Kull, appointing him to claim … which</li><li>the law … him before Abū al-Makārim al-Tājir ha-Levi b. the Elder Abū ‘Imrān Mūsa, known as (I)bn … (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Nadiv </li><li>ha-Levi, the beloved Elder (may his) R(ock) p(rotect him) b. (his) h(onor,) g(reatness, and) h(oliness, our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Moses the Elder (who) r(ests in) E(den), and someone else, and he appointed him in the aforementioned agency (agreement)</li><li>to settle and to release someone else upon whom he had a claim. The aforementioned Ghalīb said to us, after establishing the validity of this aforementioned agency (agreement)</li><li>completely, “Testify on my behalf and perform a qinyan with me, with the formula ‘effective immediately’, write and sign </li><li>[on my behalf] using all the appropriate [legal formulae] and the expressions of certainty, and all the language [of claims,] and give it to the Elder</li><li>[…in order that there would be] in his hand proof and a legal claim from this day forward […] … your hands, an acknowledgment</li><li>[…] from the aforementioned Elder Abū al-Makārim al-Tājir, in terms of good gold specie of standard Fus[ṭāṭ] weight,</li><li>[… hun]red and twenty dinars and a half and a quarter dinar of weighed gold specie. This aforementioned amount came into [my] possession</li><li>[from the] aforementioned [Elder Abū] al-Makārim in toto, completely, after verifying its weight and stamping, as a payment on behalf of his son</li><li>[…] Abu ‘Imrān the beloved youth (may his) R(ock) p(rotect him), and the aforementioned Elder Abū al-Makārim said to me that when I received </li><li>the aforementioned amount from him, ten dina(rs) from the aforementioned total which he paid, Abū ‘Imrān added (to that) from the aforementioned Sayyid al-[Kull,] </li><li>in accordance with the laws of partnership (be-torat ‘isqa). Concerning that which the aforementioned Abū al-‘Imrān claimed //for// the aforementioned Sayyid al-Kull from</li><li>Abū ‘Alī the Karaite, known as (I)bn al-‘Anī //in// al-Ṣa‘īd, sixteen dinars and a two-thirds of a dinar, and the seven dina[rs,] and the two remaining qirāṭs from</li><li>the aforementioned total amount as profit. I received the aforementioned sixteen and two-thirds dinars, and I—</li><li>the aforementioned Ghalīb—have released the Elder Abū al-Makārim ha-Levi al-Tājir, and his son the Elder [Abū] ‘Im[rā]n ha-Levi the beloved youth</li><li>from all the //aforementioned// twenty-three dinars and a half and a quarter dinars, a [complete, tota]l, effective, correct release</li><li>effective immediately, from the aforementioned Sayyid al-Kull, the one who has appointed me his agent, and upon his heirs after him, to the aforementioned Eld[er Abū al-Makārim al-Levi] al-Tājir and to his son</li><li>the aforementioned Elder Abū ‘Imrān ha-Levi and to their heirs af[ter] their [dea]ths, (a release) without any flawed </li><li>detail therein or argument nullifying [it], nor […] (and I have released him) from any</li><li>sort of vow or oath […]</li><li>a complete, effective release, effective immediately, a release without any detail [… Ghalīb]</li><li>b.
