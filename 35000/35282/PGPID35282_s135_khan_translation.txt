In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  


Ghālib ibn Ḥabāsa, son of the amīr Murād al-Dawla, servant of the commander of the faithful,  


the blessings of God be upon him, states: I have received from the elder Abū Ghālib Abdallāh ibn Manṣūr


the cashier in the land-tax office, the remainder of the first instalment of the year  four-hundred and thirty-six,  


which belongs to the amīr Sāmī al-Dawla. It amounts to twelve dīnārs, in minted  coins,  


half of this being six dīnārs. I have released him from that with a quittance of  full receipt. He wrote  


on Monday, the fourth of Shaʿbān of the year four-hundred and thirty-eight.  


Praise be to God and his blessings and peace be upon our lord Muḥammad, the  prophet, and his family.
