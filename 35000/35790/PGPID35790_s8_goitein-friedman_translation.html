<p>Mr. Joseph said: “Of the textiles given to me I sold in Dahlak forty pieces,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each piece for ⅞ good dinars. I sold the rest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for exactly 60 good dinars. Of these I sold five</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pieces, each piece for two Mālikī dinars. A sixth (of a dinar) is to be deducted from these for //customs//, and one qirāṭ {1/24 d.}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for brokerage. The exchange rate of the Mālikī in Aden was 22 for 10 good (Egyptian dinars).”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Jekuthiel questioned Mr. Joseph about the number of textiles he had received. He answered:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I remember only the amount of the forty pieces mentioned before.” Then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekuthiel inquired about the two (matching) half-mantles, which were among the textiles, and the price obtained for them. Joseph replied:</p>

<li>
<p>“I do not know for how much I sold those. Anyhow, their price is included in the aforementioned 60 dinars.” Asked also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about the mulāʾa wrap, which was among the textiles, he said: “He did not give me a mulāʾa wrap, but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a Dabīqī kerchief of seven cubits, which I supplied with borders on my own account and sold;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price is included in the total amount of 60 dinars obtained for the textiles.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Questioned about the fūṭas Joseph insisted that their prices were included in the total of 60 dinars.]</p>

<p>When asked about the Sūsī Rūsī fūṭa, he replied: “I know that this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was among the textiles. I sold it for 30 \\good// dinars, one qirāṭ more or less;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>\\included in the 60 (d.)//.” Asked also about a complete broad Maghrebi fūṭa, he replied: “I sold it;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>included in the 60 (d.).” When asked about a muthallath (‘triple-thread’ fabric) half-thawb (robe), he replied: “I know nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of a muthallath (‘triple-thread’ fabric). It was a piece of cloth, in which the textiles were packed, of Farsī material, stained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and torn. I took something from it and lined with it a leather bag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The remainder is in Aden; a turban of mine is wrapped in it. There was also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a loincloth, worth about one Egyptian silver dirhem,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which was fastened around the wrapping.” The proceedings have been written down, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>Written between the lines: {add: ‘din.’ [I,5, line 6],} ‘good’ [I,5, line 13], </li>
<li>‘included in the 60’ [line 14]. All confirmed as being correct. Crossed out words are not to be taken into account.</li>
