Mr. Joseph said: “Of the textiles given to me I sold in Dahlak forty pieces,


each piece for ⅞ good dinars. I sold the rest


for exactly 60 good dinars. Of these I sold five


pieces, each piece for two Mālikī dinars. A sixth (of a dinar) is to be deducted from these for //customs//, and one qirāṭ {1/24 d.}


for brokerage. The exchange rate of the Mālikī in Aden was 22 for 10 good (Egyptian dinars).”


Mr. Jekuthiel questioned Mr. Joseph about the number of textiles he had received. He answered:


“I remember only the amount of the forty pieces mentioned before.” Then


Jekuthiel inquired about the two (matching) half-mantles, which were among the textiles, and the price obtained for them. Joseph replied:

“I do not know for how much I sold those. Anyhow, their price is included in the aforementioned 60 dinars.” Asked also


about the mulāʾa wrap, which was among the textiles, he said: “He did not give me a mulāʾa wrap, but


a Dabīqī kerchief of seven cubits, which I supplied with borders on my own account and sold;


the price is included in the total amount of 60 dinars obtained for the textiles.”


[Questioned about the fūṭas Joseph insisted that their prices were included in the total of 60 dinars.]

 
 
 
 
 
 

When asked about the Sūsī Rūsī fūṭa, he replied: “I know that this


was among the textiles. I sold it for 30 \\good// dinars, one qirāṭ more or less;


\\included in the 60 (d.)//.” Asked also about a complete broad Maghrebi fūṭa, he replied: “I sold it;


included in the 60 (d.).” When asked about a muthallath (‘triple-thread’ fabric) half-thawb (robe), he replied: “I know nothing


of a muthallath (‘triple-thread’ fabric). It was a piece of cloth, in which the textiles were packed, of Farsī material, stained


and torn. I took something from it and lined with it a leather bag.


The remainder is in Aden; a turban of mine is wrapped in it. There was also


a loincloth, worth about one Egyptian silver dirhem,


which was fastened around the wrapping.” The proceedings have been written down, etc.

Written between the lines: {add: ‘din.’ [I,5, line 6],} ‘good’ [I,5, line 13], 
‘included in the 60’ [line 14]. All confirmed as being correct. Crossed out words are not to be taken into account.
