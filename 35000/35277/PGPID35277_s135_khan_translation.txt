In the name of God, the merciful and compassionte. Registered. 


My lord the glorious judge - may God prolong his life


and make eternal his power, his exaltedness, his loftiness, his sublimity, his eminence


and his majesty, and crush those who envy him and his enemies - has been sent a reply by the two witnesses,


reporting to him in order that the truth of what they state in their reply beratified by


a rescript of the exalted, glorious,


trustworthy, majestic, resplendent, beautiful, honourable,


crowned presence of the judge, support of the commander of the faithful, mayGod establish his days and give power


to his judgments. An ʿalāma was attached to their document, according to the familiar


practice in such matters. The contents included mention of the reply given to him by the


jurisconsults authorized to make legal decisions concerning the endowment that I granted


to my deceased wife Khulla, daughter of Fahd, namely the portion of the saidshops mentioned in the document headed by


my name, and her acceptance of that from me.


This endowment did not leave my possession and remained at my free disposal and in


my possession during her lifetime and this woman, to whom the endowment was made,


did not ratify it nor take possession of it, nor did she appoint a representative


as her agent. The accredited witnesses in the town of al-Fayyūm


recognize the validity of what I have stated and testify to its truth. (It is my) request to him to


issue a rescript for them, confirming that they recognize this, together with his reply


to the substance of it. To him belongs his auspicious and rightly-guided resolution, if God, the exalted, wills.


Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, theprophet, and save him.


Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is he!
