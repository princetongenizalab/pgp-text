<p>His slave Muslim ibn 'Abd al-Jabbār.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionte. Registered.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lord the glorious judge - may God prolong his life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and make eternal his power, his exaltedness, his loftiness, his sublimity, his eminence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and his majesty, and crush those who envy him and his enemies - has been sent a reply by the two witnesses,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reporting to him in order that the truth of what they state in their reply beratified by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a rescript of the exalted, glorious,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trustworthy, majestic, resplendent, beautiful, honourable,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>crowned presence of the judge, support of the commander of the faithful, may&nbsp;God establish his days and give power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to his judgments. An &lsquo;alāma was attached to their document, according to the familiar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practice in such matters. The contents included mention of the reply given to him by the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jurisconsults authorized to make legal decisions concerning the endowment that I granted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to my deceased wife Kulla, daughter of Fahd, namely the portion of the said shops mentioned in the document headed by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my name, and her acceptance of that from me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This endowment did not leave my possession and remained at my free disposal and in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my possession during her lifetime and this woman, to whom the endowment was made,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>did not ratify it nor take possession of it, nor did she appoint a representative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as her agent. The accredited witnesses in the town of al-Fayyūm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recognize the validity of what I have stated and testify to its truth. (It is my) request to him to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>issue a rescript for them, confirming that they recognize this, together with his reply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the substance of it. To him belongs his auspicious and rightly-guided resolution, if God, the exalted, wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muhammad, theprophet, and save him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our sufficiency is God. What a fine keeper is he!</p>
