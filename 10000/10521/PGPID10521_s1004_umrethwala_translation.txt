Recto

The slave
Yaḥya, the merchant
In the name of God the merciful and compassionate
Kisses the ground                   and asks that benefactions be extended to him
and kindness be shown to him, by granting him permission in the noble handwriting may God increase
its glory and efficacy by noble servitude (?)
Benefaction to him and kindness to him
