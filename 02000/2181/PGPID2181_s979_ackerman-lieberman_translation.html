                        <ol><li>On Friday, the third of Av, may God transform it into joy, of the year 1542 (of the Era) of Docume[nts,]</li><li>we, the witnesses who have placed our signature at the end of this document, were present for the matter in which [we] test[ified] concerning</li><li>the Elder Abū Sa‘d b. Ibrahīm al-Ṣabbāgh and the Elder Abū Manṣūr b. al-Sūkka[rī]</li><li>and Suleymān b. ‘Imrān al-Ṣabbāgh and Futūḥ b. Abū al-‘Izz al-Ṣabbāgh.</li><li>The Elder, the aforementioned Abū Sa‘d b. Ibrahīm, said to us, “We acknowledge before you that we, the aforementioned four of us, agree </li><li>that each of us //would bring out // a certain amount and buy with it merchandise and the like, and we would travel to</li><li>al-Shām. I brought out 83 dinars less two qirāṭs and they also brought out</li><li>gold and we bought merchandise and the like, and we dispatched</li><li>two shipments from the customs-office, I had the 83 (dinars) less two qirāṭs in the two shipments, and the rest of the shipments were theirs.</li><li>As when we arranged to travel, exalted God decreed and I fell ill (and) a change in constitution came upon me,</li><li>and (I) could not travel. Now, testify concerning me and perform a complete qinyan with me, that I have placed</li><li>the 83 din(ars) with them as a commenda, with which they will travel to al-Shām, selling and buying, and of whatever </li><li>God brings about in terms of profit, half and a twenty-fourth will be theirs, and a third and an eighth will be mine, for I have given them preference </li><li>over me in the profit by a twenty-fourth //which will be// the wages for their work and maintenance. If they experience a loss,</li><li>half of it will be upon me and half upon them. Similarly, I have paid to this Suleymān b. ‘Imrān 19 dina(rs)</li><li>as a commenda; of whatever he achieves in terms of profit, half and a twenty-fourth will be his and</li><li>half less a twenty-fourth will be mine, as I //have given him preference// by a twenty-fourth above the half, which will be</li><li>the wages for his work and maintenance. Testify concerning me that I have made it possible for them to act in this</li><li>commenda as they see for the good.</li></ol>
