that is the year when they dispossessed people he found it proper, 


most probably after having consulted our Master ha-Me‘ullē, 


of blessed memory, that this half (of Dār Nāqa) should be acquired for al-ʿAniyīm for this 


sum. So he went to the scribe and insisted 


that he should write in the declaration 


that this money had been received by him 


from b....., and that he ordered him to use it for the poor of the 


Jews. So the scribe wrote as he asked, but did not 


apply his mind to the words he wrote, since he understood 


that the aim desired by him, namely to acquire it for al-ʿAniyīm 


had already been attained. This was an excellent idea 


since this way he was sure that al-Kōmer would not discover 


that there was money deposited with him for the poor of the Jews 


with which to purchase a property, so as to send somebody and seize it 


from him, just as he seized the 300 dinars that 


were deposited with al-Me‘ullē, of blessed memory, for b. Shuwayʿ.
