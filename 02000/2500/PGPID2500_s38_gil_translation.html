                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>that is the year when they dispossessed people he found it proper,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>most probably after having consulted our Master ha-Me&lsquo;ullē,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of blessed memory, that this half (of Dār Nāqa) should be acquired for al-ʿAniyīm for this&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sum. So he went to the scribe and insisted&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that he should write in the declaration&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that this money had been received by him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from b....., and that he ordered him to use it for the poor of the&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jews. So the scribe wrote as he asked, but did not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply his mind to the words he wrote, since he understood&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the aim desired by him, namely to acquire it for al-ʿAniyīm&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had already been attained. This was an excellent idea&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>since this way he was sure that al-Kōmer would not discover&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that there was money deposited with him for the poor of the Jews&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with which to purchase a property, so as to send somebody and seize it&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from him, just as he seized the 300 dinars that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>were deposited with al-Me&lsquo;ullē, of blessed memory, for b. Shuwayʿ.</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>(They were) known as people who fear God, may He be exalted. So after having&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>read this will as granted by the owner&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the property himself, according to the Jewish laws, we relied&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(4-5) upon it and made it an ordinary waqf for the poor, as our Sages, of blessed memory, said: There is a commandment&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>(6-7) to fulfill the words of the deceased. So it was not an arbitrary act of al-Shaykh Abūʾl-Faraj b. Qusāsā to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>write as he did in the declaration, since he was,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may he be of blessed memory, a God-fearing person, a righteous man,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a man of charity for the poor and the students of&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Torah. It only appears from the case&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that this money was deposited with him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by our Master ha-Meʿullē, of blessed memory, until some property would become available,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be purchased with (this money). But as there occurred the accession of al- Kōmer,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(15-16) may his bones be pulverized! - since the date of the declaration is the year 521&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
