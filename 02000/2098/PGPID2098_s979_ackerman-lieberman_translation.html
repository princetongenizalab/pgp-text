                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol><li>Mr. Nathaniel b. M(r.) Japheth (who) r(ests in) E(den) brought a document to the court,</li><li>verified with (the) trustworthiness (of witnesses) and warning (lest one violate the clauses of the document); the amount of its capital was six[ty]-five</li><li>din(ars), due from Mr. Tobias ha-Levi. He (the court) asked Mr. Tobias </li><li>about it, and he said, “He (already) received ten dina(rs) from me (out of the total) of this document,</li><li>in two payments, as well as 15 raṭls of silk worth 15 din(ars) and two and a half mann</li><li>of ‘Abīr, worth another 15 din(ars). All of this stayed with him at night</li><li>and came to me in the morning, but he demanded more from me by way of way of settlement </li><li>for that of (a further) 5 mann of essence of Kābulī and the remainder of the assets from the document,</li><li>its amount being 25 din(ars). I have given him therein a jar of butter</li><li>weighing 25 wuqiyyas, which I left with him until the journey of</li><li>Abū al-Faraj the agent drew near. Then we all agreed to </li><li>send the butter with the aforementioned agent, on the condition that when</li><li>he returns, may God facilitate it, he will receive the rest due him,</li><li>and I (myself) will receive the balance of its price.” Then he (the court) asked (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Nathaniel about it</li><li>and he said, “As for the ten dina(rs) which he mentioned, only 3 dina(rs) and a quarter and a sixth have reached me out of </li><li>the assets of this document. As for </li><li>the silk and the ‘Abīr and the Kābulī , he was not correct (in saying) that I took them</li><li>having been weighed, and the weights which he mentioned of silk and ‘Abīr</li><li>were incorrect, for I weighed them when he took them, and I found </li><li>two mann and 45 dirhams’(-worth) of ‘Abīr,   and 14 and a quarter raṭls </li><li>and five dirhams’(-worth) of silk, and the same amount of Kābulī  remaining. As for the butter</li><li>which he mentioned, he agreed with me in sending </li><li>some of it with Abū al-Faraj the agent.” Then he brought him to the court for what he claimed</li></ol>
