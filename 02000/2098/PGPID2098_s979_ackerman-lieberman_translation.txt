Recto
Mr. Nathaniel b. M(r.) Japheth (who) r(ests in) E(den) brought a document to the court,verified with (the) trustworthiness (of witnesses) and warning (lest one violate the clauses of the document); the amount of its capital was six[ty]-fivedin(ars), due from Mr. Tobias ha-Levi. He (the court) asked Mr. Tobias about it, and he said, “He (already) received ten dina(rs) from me (out of the total) of this document,in two payments, as well as 15 raṭls of silk worth 15 din(ars) and two and a half mannof ‘Abīr, worth another 15 din(ars). All of this stayed with him at nightand came to me in the morning, but he demanded more from me by way of way of settlement for that of (a further) 5 mann of essence of Kābulī and the remainder of the assets from the document,its amount being 25 din(ars). I have given him therein a jar of butterweighing 25 wuqiyyas, which I left with him until the journey ofAbū al-Faraj the agent drew near. Then we all agreed to send the butter with the aforementioned agent, on the condition that whenhe returns, may God facilitate it, he will receive the rest due him,and I (myself) will receive the balance of its price.” Then he (the court) asked (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Nathaniel about itand he said, “As for the ten dina(rs) which he mentioned, only 3 dina(rs) and a quarter and a sixth have reached me out of the assets of this document. As for the silk and the ‘Abīr and the Kābulī , he was not correct (in saying) that I took themhaving been weighed, and the weights which he mentioned of silk and ‘Abīrwere incorrect, for I weighed them when he took them, and I found two mann and 45 dirhams’(-worth) of ‘Abīr,   and 14 and a quarter raṭls and five dirhams’(-worth) of silk, and the same amount of Kābulī  remaining. As for the butterwhich he mentioned, he agreed with me in sending some of it with Abū al-Faraj the agent.” Then he brought him to the court for what he claimed
