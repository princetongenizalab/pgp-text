Recto

        ... I am not well because

         ... found us at a bad time


         ... five and then God rescued us


          … the east to Saite and everything that


         ...the Ishmaelites, and I (?) was left without


        ... to the God of Israel, who saved her 


        ... here, and he gives pain and binds up wounds, he smites


and his hands heal, for his mercies and lovingkindnesses do not fail. And you, wife,


say, Let not my mind be anxious about the belt and the two dīnārs.


God knows if I find someone who is coming I shall send


both the belt and the money, the dīnārs, because now I have nothing left.


But do not be sad about this: God is great. The woman, the wife of


Mar Joseph, whose name was Evdokia, has died, but the rest


are well. Write a letter and send it to Alexandria, in case


anyone comes here from there, so we can hear your news.   Greetings from


my mother and from my uncle Mar Elia and from your brothers and from everyone. And all the trouble


is great for you. Give my regards to Mar Solomon my friend and to


Mar Jacob the enameller (τὀν χυµευτόν) and his mother and his brothers. And may God permit me to see


joy. Amen and amen.
