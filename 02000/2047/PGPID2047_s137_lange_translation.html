<li>        ... I am not well because</li>
<li>
<p>         ... found us at a bad time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>         ... five and then God rescued us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>          … the east to Saite and everything that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>         ...the Ishmaelites, and I (?) was left without</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        ... to the God of Israel, who saved her </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>        ... here, and he gives pain and binds up wounds, he smites</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and his hands heal, for his mercies and lovingkindnesses do not fail. And you, wife,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>say, Let not my mind be anxious about the belt and the two dīnārs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God knows if I find someone who is coming I shall send</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>both the belt and the money, the dīnārs, because now I have nothing left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But do not be sad about this: God is great. The woman, the wife of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mar Joseph, whose name was Evdokia, has died, but the rest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are well. Write a letter and send it to Alexandria, in case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anyone comes here from there, so we can hear your news.   Greetings from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my mother and from my uncle Mar Elia and from your brothers and from everyone. And all the trouble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is great for you. Give my regards to Mar Solomon my friend and to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mar Jacob the enameller (τὀν χυµευτόν) and his mother and his brothers. And may God permit me to see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>joy. Amen and amen.</p>
