                        <ol><li>We performed a qinyan with our teacher and our master Moses the Student, the honored, the Elder, b. our teacher and our master Ṭahor, the honored Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den),</li><li>that he agreed to the partnership (shirka) of Abū Sa‘[d] b. Abū al-‘Alā’ the Dyer (may his) e(nd be) g(ood), in an apothecary-shop. He will manage the shop which</li><li>he has, and whatever is there in terms of capital, whether it is forty dinars or twenty or (even a single) dinar. He will take from the aforementioned Abū Sa‘d </li><li>only whatever dirhams there will be out of the dirhams used in the Egyptian localities. He will take from the … store</li><li>only a quarter each day, six dirhams a month, (for) his five sons. Then we performed a qinyan with the aforementioned Moses, to the effect that he agreed </li><li>with the glorious Elder al-Sa‘īd  and to his partnership (shirka) for the period of a year and a half. He is obligated (to work in) the store and he will not get up from it. If he gets up from it, </li><li>the qinyan shall be nullified. Then we performed a qinyan with his father, the Elder Abū al-‘Alā’, a complete qinyan, with the formula “effective immediately”, that he received from him</li><li>as a guarantee of his son Abū Sa‘d’s fulfilment of the obligation to the store. Then we performed a qinyan with Abū Sa‘d to the effect that he would pay to the aforementioned, our teacher and our master Moses</li><li>the Student a quarter of a dirham each day, not withholding from him the total of six dirhams a month, for the aforementioned length of a year and a half.</li><li>When the complete qinyan was effected, the stipulations were oral, effective immediately… […]</li><li>and we signed and gave it to […]</li><li>for Documents, in Fu[sṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River …]</li></ol>
