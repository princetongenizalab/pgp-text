                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In your name, merciful one.</li>
<li>I am writing to you &mdash;&nbsp;my lord, the lofty elder, may God perpetuate your existence and make your protection and benefactions eternal&nbsp;</li>
<li>and humiliatingly vanquish your enviers and enemies, and in his great success [illegible] &hellip;</li>
<li>&hellip; in all matters, God willing &mdash; to inform you, my lord, that&nbsp;</li>
<li>after leaving you on Sunday, I went on foot together with ʿImrān and Ibrāhīm&nbsp;</li>
<li>to Minya looking for a boat. When I did not find one, I set out</li>
<li>as I was, walking to Giza and &mdash; as God is my witness &mdash; I plodded along&nbsp;</li>
<li>until I arrived on Tuesday afternoon almost dead. At the very moment I arrived,</li>
<li>there also arrived the riding animals of the amīr. This was the blessing of my staying with you over the Sabbath. I went&nbsp;</li>
<li>on my way and met the elder Abū l-Faḍl and handed over the document to him.</li>
<li>He said he didn&rsquo;t know much himself. Had he not stayed, he wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten</li>
<li>more than what happened to him. He said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take anything from him, and if I could have,&nbsp;</li>
<li>I would have done it.&rdquo; I stayed with him for five days. Then Abū ʿImrān &mdash; may God keep him alive &mdash;</li>
<li>realized that this was going to be a drawn-out affair. So he took me to the elder Abū l-Maʿālī&nbsp;</li>
<li>and said to him, &ldquo;Introduce this man to [the official titled] Tāj al-ʿAjam [diadem of the Persians].&rdquo; But the elder Abū l- Maʿālī replied, &ldquo;[Even] the amīr is</li>
<li>of lower rank than this one.&rdquo; So he wrote a note for me to the elder Abū Isḥaq ibn Mubashshir,&nbsp;</li>
<li>who is the head of the bureau of Ibn Qadīsh. [Abū Isḥaq ibn Mubashshir] asked me to sit down until one of his assistants came,&nbsp;</li>
<li>to whom he then said: &ldquo;Tell Zaʿīm al-Dawla [another official] to clear this man&rsquo;s produce [of its tax obligation]. If not, I myself will serve as the receipt.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li>He told Abū ʿImrān, &ldquo;Go with him.&rdquo; Indeed &mdash; God is my witness &mdash; he went down with me to&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fusṭāṭ four times in one day until we found him. He wrote me [a document] to clear [the produce].</li>
<li>But then Abū ʿImrān said to him, &ldquo;I will only accept a clearance for the two [batches of] produce together.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li>So he wrote me a clearance for everything, after all this upheaval. But he [also] wrote to the elder Abū Isḥaq, saying,&nbsp;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Tell him they [the officials] have eaten up my produce and conspired to take all my property. Had it not been for&nbsp;</li>
<li>you, I would not have handed over a single grain of wheat.&rdquo; Abū ʿImrān said to me, &ldquo;&hellip; [text illegible]</li>
<li>to the elder Abū Naṣr, had there remained anything for him, he would have told me. Perhaps</li>
<li>he will take two other books and pawn them.&rdquo; I found a turban after turning the world upside down. I lodged a complaint with our lord, and what he did for me was not negligible. Don&rsquo;t ask&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

                        <h3>Recto, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>what I had to go through</li>
<li>because of my lord [you].&nbsp;</li>
<li>He said to me,&nbsp;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I raised you,</li>
<li>and you&rsquo;re&nbsp;</li>
<li>like a son to me.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ve disappointed</li>
<li>my hopes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>I said</li>
<li>to him, &ldquo;I have no idea&nbsp;</li>
<li>from whom you [illegible]</li>
<li>&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, top margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>So then your brother-in-law came</li>
<li>calling me a liar.</li>
<li>He said: &ldquo;A guy&nbsp;</li>
<li>and a group of people&nbsp;</li>
<li>told me</li>
<li>that he [the recipient of the letter]&nbsp;</li>
<li>was up to such-</li>
<li>and-such."&nbsp;</li>
<li>I swore it to him [your brother-in-law],&nbsp;</li>
<li>but he wouldn&rsquo;t&nbsp;</li>
<li>believe me.</li>
<li>For God&rsquo;s sake,</li>
<li>for God&rsquo;s sake,</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t need&nbsp;</li>
<li>your admonitions!</li>
<li>People talk</li>

                        <ol>
<li>a lot, and God has not granted them blessings. As God is my witness,</li>
<li>I sold the threadbare kerchief I used to wear for 13&frac12; dirhāms, and paid&nbsp;</li>
<li>the capitation tax with it. The flax reached your sister &hellip; But I didn&rsquo;t pay a thing for it.</li>
<li>I collected five raṭls of flax from Hibba. Your sister sends greetings to your maternal uncle.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Many congratulations on your sister delivering a boy and a girl. But don&rsquo;t ask&nbsp;</li>
<li>me how she scolds you. Were it not for the fact that I had to stay put because of your maternal uncle,</li>
<li>I would come instead of sending this letter, may God ordain life. Enclosed in this&nbsp;</li>
<li>letter is the signature of Zaʿīm ad-Dawla for the release of all the produce, both batches. Kindly&nbsp;</li>
<li>sell them for me for any price God grants, as my situation is not unknown&nbsp;</li>
<li>to you. You &mdash; may God keep you alive &mdash; know the underground cellar [where it&rsquo;s stored]. The elder</li>
<li>Abū ʿAlī&nbsp;reprimands you a lot, saying, &ldquo;I sent him forty dirhams&nbsp;</li>
<li>in Qāsim&rsquo;s care with which to buy me barley, but he hasn&rsquo;t sent any yet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Accept for yourself the most perfect greetings. Greetings to my lord Abū Naṣr and to Abū l- &hellip; [illegible],</li>
<li>and everyone protected by your solicitude [i.e., those to whom you serve as social patron], best greetings and peace.&nbsp;</li>
<li>By God, by God, I do not need your admonitions. If every dog badmouths</li>
<li>your honor, do not blame me for this statement of mine. I assure you, had I not heard&nbsp;</li>
<li>lowlives talk badly about you, I would not have told you anything. I have told you all this [already].</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso, address</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>&nbsp;To my master the elder Abū l-Ḥasan ʿEli, son of Hillel the cantor</li>
<li>from his servant Abū Saʿīd [Ḥalfon ben Menashshe] Ibn Qaṭāʾif.</li>
<li>Convey and you will be rewarded.</li>
