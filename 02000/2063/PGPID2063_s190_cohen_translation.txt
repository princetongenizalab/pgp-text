Recto
I wrote to your excellen[cy …]. I entreat[ed] you to kindly send your slave 4 irdabbs of wheat // above the line: their price is about 15 dirhems per irdabb, // 2½ of them at their price, and 1½ irdabb to be at the disposal of your slave, your poor foreigner. I come not as a warner but as one who reminds. Your slave is living off the charity of some of my countrymen and friends and masters // above the line: who pay on my behalf the poll tax. // May God grant you life and remember them with kindness as well as all those who act kindly toward me. Why has my lord left me out of his gifts? Does scripture not say: "You shall rejoice in all the goodness that the Lord God has given to you and your house, you and the Levite and the stranger who is in your midst," (Deuteronomy 26:11) "for I am a stranger along with you" (Psalm 39:13). Who, moreover, among the poor of Egypt (Fustat) is more deserving than I, who am incapacitated? Our teacher Moses sold me for little or nothing. I present this petition to your excellency, and "let not the downtrodden tum away disappointed" (Psalm 74:21). One does not have to wish you well over and over again. Your sla[ve will serve at your feet as long as he remains in Fustat, thanking you before God and man. May the Omnipresent, blessed be He, double your reward and welfare and the welfare of my lord "the Diadem" your brother. And peace to my lord your son, may the Holy one blessed be He grant him life and protect him. Amen.
In the name of love, I seek refuge in your kindness [...] your excellency, I informed you in letters. I ask from your excellency 60 dirhams, one dinar on your [a]cco[u]nt, leaving one half. As for me, I [...] silver and not gol[d] and [...] ir[dabb …] dirhams each per irdabb. And p[eace].
