                        <p>On Thursday, the 25th of Tishri of the year 1339 according to the Era of the Documents there appeared before the court in the Synagogue of the Jerusalemites Bushr, son of Ephraim, and Barhūn, son of Yiḥye.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aforenamed Bushr confirmed that he hired out his son Joseph to the aforenamed Barhun for the duration of four months, beginning with the New moon day of the month of Marcheshvan of the above mentioned year to the end of the month of Shevat against a payment of sixty dirhems, making fifteen dirhems per month, on condition that Joseph shall become proficient in the work on the loom. If Barhūn fails to advance Joseph in this craft so that he will become proficient like a regular craftsman, Barhun must employ him for a period of another &lt;four&gt; months and pay him the wages of a craftsman. The symbolic purchase was made from them with regard to all that has been said and described above in this court record.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joseph, son of Bushr, was also present. The content of this record was read out to him. He was agreeable to it, and the symbolic purchase with regard to this agreement was made from both of them (apprentice and master).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aforenamed Bahrūn (for: Barhūn) imposed on Joseph and his father that Joseph should not absent himself from his work except for a justifiable reason, in which case the wages would be reduced accordingly, and that he should not be remiss in his work. For this also the symbolic purchase was made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Japheth, the cantor, son of Rabbi David, the cantor, (may) G(od's) s(pirit bring him) r(est).</p>
<p>Solomon, son of Ḥakim (may he) r(est in) peace).</p>
