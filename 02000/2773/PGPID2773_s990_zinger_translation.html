                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In Your name, Oh Merciful,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace and peace again from the Lord of Peace and from Him who makes in heaven peace. The Creator of All knows&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how much longing I have for my lord and master the venerable parnas, my elder, my honor and my dignity, the one&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who is there for me at times of calamities. I ask the Creator of All to keep you alive, protect you, and make your end&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>good. May I not be deprived of your letter concerning the good that you have done for the woman. May (God) protect your son,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ibn Kathīr, and gladden you with him. I pray for you night and day. You are there for me in every&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>calamity. I boast of (knowing) no one but you. To everyone who talks to me, I say: &ldquo;My lord the parnas,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he shall obtain a ruling for me.&rdquo; I inform you, my lord and master, that the woman came from you (plur.)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and I found with her a letter. The cantor, Judge Menasse, (may the) R(ock) p(rotect him), my lord Ibn Maḥbūb&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the elder Abū al-Faradj, and the cantor from Ashkelon took it. They were a group of people assembled&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the synagogue. (They) read the letter, examined what was in it, and did exactly what it said. They instructed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the young man, who is the husband of my daughter, that there shall be no exception, except that he pay her the delayed marriage settlement&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The young man yielded and kissed my head and the head of her mother. They made amends between us and we all yielded.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hereby inform my master the parnas, (may the) R(ock) p(rotect him), of what happened, may I not be deprived of your favor and may I be made&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your ransom. I send you the most favor- able and most perfect greetings, and greetings to your son, and greetings to ʿAyyāsh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank him in my place, may I not be deprived of you and may I not be deprived of him, for what he did with the woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The writer of these words (i.e., the scribe), your servant and child, the young man, the cantor Ibn al-Ghāzfīnī, who made&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the connection with you, kisses your hands and sends you the most favorable and most perfect greetings. He, I, and my uncle pray for you with the Torah scroll&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the synagogue of Malīdj. I ask the Creator of All to keep you alive, my master the parnas.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May He fulfill for you the biblical quote: &ldquo;The Lord is thy keeper; the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand&rdquo; (Psalms 121: 5). May your peace&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ever increase and not decease. Amen neṣaḥ selah.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great Salvation!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(p.s.) I, Ibn al-Ghāzfīnī the cantor, ask my master the parnas to send my greetings&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Manṣūr Ibn Dinūn, who is from the people of our city and lives in the neighborhood of the Palestinian synagogue, in the bakery alleyway (darb al-furn).</p>
</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right-hand margin</h3>
                    
                        <p>I wrote (this letter) in a time of haste in the evening, otherwise I would have wished to pray a lot for my lord the par- nas, (may) G(od) p(rotect him).</p>
<p>And thank for me Ibn Maḥbūb, I pray for him, and peace.</p>

                        <p>May it arrive to my lord, my master and my dignity, the venerable parnas, the elder Abū Kathīr, may God protect him. To Miṣr, to the hand of the parnas.</p>
<p>From him who loves him, Naḥum b. ⟦Hiba⟧ Manṣūr, (may he) R(est in) E(den)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great Salvation!</p>
