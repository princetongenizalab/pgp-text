<p>In your n(ame), Oh Merci(ful)!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have previously written to the august elder and patron our mas(ter) and tea(cher) Elijah (may his) R(ock) p(reserve him),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about the elder Abu'l-Maka'rim, namely, that he still owes some poll-tax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the sum of thirty dirhems. However, he is in tough straits and every week the tax-collector fines him (for being in arrears)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one silver piece. He is used to receiving favors from you and he asks, since you are so kind,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you deal with him, in accordance with your customary munificence. Perhaps you can get it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for him at the reception for b. al-Muzaghlil or else at the reception for Abu'l-Baraka't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May you be as one (of those) about whom (our sages) - peace be upon them! - said: a worthy deed is entrusted (by God)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to a worthy man (to carry out). (And they also said: Heaven's) reward is made to fit a man's exertion (in doing good deeds). You have been kind to him.</p>
</li>
</ol>
