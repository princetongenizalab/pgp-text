Recto


In your n(ame), Oh Merci(ful)!


I have previously written to the august elder and patron our mas(ter) and tea(cher) Elijah (may his) R(ock) p(reserve him),


about the elder Abu'l-Maka'rim, namely, that he still owes some poll-tax.


in the sum of thirty dirhems. However, he is in tough straits and every week the tax-collector fines him (for being in arrears)


one silver piece. He is used to receiving favors from you and he asks, since you are so kind,


that you deal with him, in accordance with your customary munificence. Perhaps you can get it


for him at the reception for b. al-Muzaghlil or else at the reception for Abu'l-Baraka't.


May you be as one (of those) about whom (our sages) - peace be upon them! - said: a worthy deed is entrusted (by God)


to a worthy man (to carry out). (And they also said: Heaven's) reward is made to fit a man's exertion (in doing good deeds). You have been kind to him.

Keep your word, and fulfill (it)!
