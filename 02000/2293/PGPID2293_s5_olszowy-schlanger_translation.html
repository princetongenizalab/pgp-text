<li><span lang="en">In the name of the Living God. They built and prospered (II Chron. 14: 6). In the Lord they shall be justified and praised etc. (Is. 45: 25). And the elders of the Jews build and prosper (Ezra 6: 14).</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">On Friday, on the twenty sixth of the month Shevat, of the year one thousand three hundred thirty nine of the era of</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the Greeks, in Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be rebuilt soon, Amen. On this day Ḥizkiyahu, the fine young man, ben Benjamin, came before the</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">elders who sign</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">below, in this document, and said to them: be my witnesses and perform now with me the qinyan, write down an sign about me all what, with full rights, I declare</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">before you. And I am not coerced, not mistaken, not in error and under no compulsion, but with full resolve and willingly I have married, performed the qinyan and betrothed</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">Sarwa, the young girl, the virgin, daughter of Ṣedaqa ben Jarīr, by mohar, writ and sexual intercourse, according to the commandment of Moses, man of God, of blessed memory, and according to the custom of Israel</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the pure and the holy ones. And I shall dress, clothe, and support her. I shall fulfil all her legitimate needs and desires to the best of my strength</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and possibilities, and I shall be with her in truth, justice, love and affection, and I shall not afflict or oppress her, and I shall not diminish her food</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">clothes and sexual intercourse, in the manner of the children of Israel who feed, support, dress and clothe their pure wives and fulfil all they owe</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">them in faithfulness and honesty.    And the mohar that I stipulated and allocated for her is fifty coins of silver, mohar of her virginity. And I added for her forty dinars,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">good, full, weighed. Of these, I have advanced her, before I come to her, five dinars. As for the fifty coins of silver which are the mohar of her virginity,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">I shall give them to her on this day, at the time of her wedding, and thirty five good dinars will remain incumbent upon me and upon my estate after me, as a true</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">strong and binding debt. And this Sarwa accepted the words of [th]is Ḥizkiyahu, and wished to be married to him, to be his wife and companion in purity, holiness</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and awe, to obey, esteem, respect and help him, and to do in [his house] all that the pure daughters of Israel do in the house of their husbands; to behave</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">towards him in love and compassion; to be under his dominion and have [her des]ire directed towards him. And this Sarwa [wished] to appoint as her agent Joseph ben Abraham</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">ha-Kohen to represent her and to take care of the affairs of her marriage. Two trustworthy men witnessed about her, and they are Mevorakh ben David and Jacob ben</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">Faḍlān. And this Joseph, the agent, came before the elders and testified about himself [that] he received the payment and cleared this Ḥizkiyahu from the advanced mohar of this Sarwa,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">which is five dinars, and that he willingly gave this Sarwa into marriage to this Hizkiyahu with this mohar and the conditions specified</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">above in this document. These are the belongings that this Sarwa brought with her to the house of her husband Ḥizkiyahu. They are: from the gold: a pair of wristbands,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">5 din.; a pair of earrings, 2; a ring of gold and three rings of silver, 2; light green festive dress, 3; a transparent veil, 1; a Rīḥānī wimple, 6 din.; a dark-blue ᶜaqabiyya dress, 2;</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">a Sicilian tunic, 2 1/2 ; a snow-white undershirt and a wimple, 2; a wrap, 2; two white tunics and a veil, 2; two red tunics, a wrap and two wimples, 2; a Rūmī bathrobe</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and a piece of red silk, 1; a kerchief for the face, 1; a silk gown and a pink undershirt, 1; a linen mantle 11/2 ; a Sicilian tunic, 1; four kerchiefs and a bathrobe, 1. From</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the copper: a Baghdadi bucket and its dipper, 3; a basin and a ewer, 2; a chandelier and a lamp, 2; a Damascene pot, 2; a large toilette basket, 1 1/2 ; a bucket</span></li>

<li><span lang="en">a Ṭabarī sofa and a pad, 3 din.; a brocade blanket, 3; a Buzyōn sofa, 2; a mattress and six pillows 1 1/2. The total of all is</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">sixty one and a half dinars. This Ḥizkiyahu declared before the elders, that all these belongings arrived to his house and that all</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">will remain under his jurisdiction and in his possession, and that he took upon himself that he will keep them as all that belongs to him, and he will not change anything from them without the knowledge of his wife Sarwa</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and without her consent. He also took the responsibility for this ketubba upon himself and upon his estate after him, except for what is lost or worn out. And they agreed between themselves that if,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">God forbid, this Sarwa leaves this world without a child from him, all that she brought in with her will return to her heirs from her family, and</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">her heirs will have no claim on the delayed mohar payment incumbent on the aforementioned Ḥizkiyahu. [They also agreed] that they shall keep the holidays of the Lord according to the sighting of the Moon and the finding of</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the aviv in the Land of Israel, and will not eat the meat of cattle and sheep in Jerusalem until the altar of the Lord is rebuilt, and they will not appeal to the Gentile courts to change</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the laws of the Torah. And we performed the qinyan with Ḥizkiyahu ben Benjamin concerning all what is written and made clear above, and what happened before us, we wrote</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and signed and gave to this Sarwa daughter of Ṣedaqa, to be in her possession as proof, right and testimony according to the law of Moses and Israel, may they build and prosper.</span></li>
