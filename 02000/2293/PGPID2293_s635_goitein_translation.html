<li>​​In the Name of the Living God. "And they built and were successful." "In God they will triumph and glory." "And the Judean elders build and are successful."</li>
<li>On Friday, the twenty-sixth of the month of Shevat of the year 1339 according to the era</li>
<li>of the Greeks, in Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be rebuilt soon, Amen, on this very day appeared Hezekiah, the fine young man, son of Benjamin, before the elders signing</li>
<li>this document and said to them: Give witness against me, and make the symbolic purchase from me,</li>
<li>write down and sign as a legal obligation on me, conveying rights, that I</li>
<li>make the following declaration without being compelled, mistaken, erring,</li>
<li>or forced, but acting in full capacity and out of my free will;</li>
<li>That I take, gain possession of, and marry Sarwa, the virgin maid, the</li>
<li>daughter of Sadaqa b. Jarir, by means of the nuptial gift, this contract, and</li>
<li>consummation, as ordered by Moses, the man of God, of blessed memory,</li>
<li>and in accordance with the law of Israel, the pure and holy.</li>
<li>I shall provide her with clothing for home and street, as well as food,</li>
<li>supply all her needs and appropriate wishes according to my ability</li>
<li>the extent I can afford. I shall conduct myself toward her with truthfulness</li>
<li>and sincerity, with love and affection. I will not grieve or oppress her but</li>
<li>let have her food, clothing, and marital relations to the extent habitual</li>
<li>among Jewish men, who...&nbsp;</li>
<li>As nuptial gift I have assigned her fifty pieces of silver, as due to a</li>
<li>virgin, with an additional gift of forty good and complete gold pieces of</li>
<li>full weight. Of these, I have already given her five gold pieces. The fifty</li>
<li>silver pieces I am giving her today at the wedding ceremony, and thirty-five</li>
<li>good gold pieces remain as a fully certified and established debt incumbent</li>
<li>on me and on my possessions during my life time and after my death.</li>
<li>The above-mentioned Sarwa listened to the words of Hezekiah and</li>
<li>agreed to marry him and to be his wife and companion" in purity, holiness,</li>
<li>and fear of God, to listen to his words, to honor and to hold him dear, to be</li>
<li>his helper,'" and to do in his house what a virtuous Jewish woman is expected to do, to conduct herself toward him with love and considerateness,</li>
<li>to be under his rule, and her desire will be toward him.</li>
<li>Sarwa, out of her free will, appointed as her representative Joseph b.</li>
<li>Abraham ha-Kohen to take care of the affairs of her marriage. Two</li>
<li>trustworthy persons, Mevorakh b. David and Jacob b. Fallan, were the</li>
<li>witnesses of this appointment.</li>
<li>This Joseph, the representative, appeared before the elders and testified</li>
<li>that he had received from Hezekiah the preliminary payment of five gold</li>
<li>pieces and that he agreed to marry off the above-mentioned Sarwa to</li>
<li>Hezekiah with this nuptial gift on the conditions specified above in this</li>

<li>the knowledge and consent of his wife Sarwa. He took upon himself and</li>
<li>upon his estate after his death responsibility that nothing should be lost or</li>

<li>The two agreed between themselves that should Sarwa, God beware,</li>
<li>leave this world without a child from him, all that she brought in with her</li>

<li>would not apply to a gentile court in exchange for the laws of the Torah.</li>

<li>happened in our presence, signed the document and put it into the hand of</li>
