<p>"And they built and were successful."</p>
<p>"In God they will triumph and glory."</p>
<p>"And the Judean elders build and are successful."'</p>
<p>On Friday, the twenty-sixth of the month of Shevat of the year 1339 ac-</p>
<p>cording to the era of the Greeks," in Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be</p>
<p>rebuilt soon, Amen, on this very day appeared Hezekiah, the fine young</p>
<p>man, son of Benjamin, before the elders signing this document and said to</p>
<p>them:</p>
<p>Give witness against me, and make the symbolic purchase from me,</p>
<p>write down and sign as a legal obligation on me, conveying rights, that I</p>
<p>make the following declaration without being compelled, mistaken, erring,</p>
<p>or forced, but acting in full capacity and out of my free will;</p>
<p>That I take, gain possession of, and marry Sarwa, the virgin maid, the</p>
<p>daughter of Sadaqa b. Jarir, by means of the nuptial gift, this contract, and</p>
<p>consummation, as ordered by Moses, the man of God, of blessed memory,</p>
<p>and in accordance with the law of Israel, the pure and holy.</p>
<p>I shall provide her with clothing for home and street, as well as food,</p>
<p>supply all her needs and appropriate wishes according to my ability</p>
<p>the extent I can afford. I shall conduct myself toward her with truthfulness</p>
<p>and sincerity, with love and affection. I will not grieve or oppress her but</p>
<p>let have her food, clothing, and marital relations to the extent habitual</p>
<p>among Jewish men, who...&nbsp;</p>
<p>As nuptial gift I have assigned her fifty pieces of silver, as due to a</p>
<p>virgin, with an additional gift of forty good and complete gold pieces of</p>
<p>full weight. Of these, I have already given her five gold pieces. The fifty</p>
<p>silver pieces I am giving her today at the wedding ceremony, and thirty-five</p>
<p>good gold pieces remain as a fully certified and established debt incumbent</p>
<p>on me and on my possessions during my life time and after my death.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Sarwa listened to the words of Hezekiah and</p>
<p>agreed to marry him and to be his wife and companion" in purity, holiness,</p>
<p>and fear of God, to listen to his words, to honor and to hold him dear, to be</p>
<p>his helper,'" and to do in his house what a virtuous Jewish woman is expected to do, to conduct herself toward him with love and considerateness,</p>
<p>to be under his rule, and her desire will be toward him.</p>
<p>Sarwa, out of her free will, appointed as her representative Joseph b.</p>
<p>Abraham ha-Kohen to take care of the affairs of her marriage. Two</p>
<p>trustworthy persons, Mevorakh b. David and Jacob b. Fallan, were the</p>
<p>witnesses of this appointment.</p>
<p>This Joseph, the representative, appeared before the elders and testified</p>
<p>that he had received from Hezekiah the preliminary payment of five gold</p>
<p>pieces and that he agreed to marry off the above-mentioned Sarwa to</p>
<p>Hezekiah with this nuptial gift on the conditions specified above in this</p>

<p>The above-mentioned Hezekiah declared in the presence of the elders</p>
<p>that all these valuables had come into his house and were now in his posses-</p>
<p>sion and under his hand; and that he had undertaken to keep them as if they</p>
<p>were his own; and that he would not make any change with them without</p>
<p>the knowledge and consent of his wife Sarwa. He took upon himself and</p>
<p>upon his estate after his death responsibility that nothing should be lost or</p>
<p>spoiled.</p>
<p>The two agreed between themselves that should Sarwa, God beware,</p>
<p>leave this world without a child from him, all that she brought in with her</p>
<p>would go back to her heirs from her kin. Contrariwise, her heirs would</p>
<p>have no claim on the final instalment of the nuptial gift incumbent on</p>
<p>Hezekiah.</p>
<p>They also agreed to keep the holidays by the observation of the new</p>
<p>moon and of the ripening of the ears in Eretz Israel; that they would not eat</p>
<p>beef and mutton in Jerusalem until the altar of God is erected; and that they</p>
<p>would not apply to a gentile court in exchange for the laws of the Torah.</p>
<p>We made the symbolic purchase from Hezekiah, son of Benjamin, with</p>
<p>regard to all that is written and stated above. We have written down all that</p>
<p>happened in our presence, signed the document and put it into the hand of</p>
<p>Sarwa, the daughter of Sadaqa, so that it should be in her hand as a proof,</p>
<p>an instrument of claims, and a testimony in accordance with the law of</p>
<p>Moses and Israel.</p>
<p>And they built and were successful [signatures].</p>
