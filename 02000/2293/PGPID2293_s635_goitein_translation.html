<li>​​In the Name of the Living God. "And they built and were successful." "In God they will triumph and glory." "And the Judean elders build and are successful."</li>
<li>On Friday, the twenty-sixth of the month of Shevat of the year 1339 according to the era</li>
<li>of the Greeks, in Jerusalem, the Holy City, may it be rebuilt soon, Amen, on this very day appeared Hezekiah, the fine young man, son of Benjamin, before the elders signing</li>
<li>this document and said to them: Give witness against me, and make the symbolic purchase from me, write down and sign as a legal obligation on me, conveying rights, that I make the following declaration</li>
<li>without being compelled, mistaken, erring, or forced, but acting in full capacity and out of my free will; that I take, gain possession of, and marry</li>
<li>Sarwa, the virgin maid, the daughter of Ṣadaqa b. Jarīr, by means of the nuptial gift, this contract, and consummation, as ordered by Moses, the man of God, of blessed memory, and in accordance with the law of Israel,</li>
<li>the pure and holy. I shall provide her with clothing for home and street, as well as food, supply all her needs and appropriate wishes according to my ability</li>
<li>and the extent I can afford. I shall conduct myself toward her with truthfulness and sincerity, with love and affection. I will not grieve or oppress her but let have her food,</li>
<li>clothing, and marital relations to the extent habitual among Jewish men, who ... (Goitein does not translate the following words of formula.) </li>
<li>As nuptial gift I have assigned her fifty pieces of silver, as due to a virgin, with an additional gift of forty</li>
<li>good and complete gold pieces of full weight. Of these, I have already given her five gold pieces. The fifty silver pieces</li>
<li>I am giving her today at the wedding ceremony, and thirty-five good gold pieces remain as a fully certified and established debt incumbent on me and on my possessions during my life time and after my death.</li>
<li>The above-mentioned Sarwa listened to the words of Hezekiah and agreed to marry him and to be his wife and companion" in purity, holiness,</li>
<li>and fear of God, to listen to his words, to honor and to hold him dear, to be his helper, and to do in his house what a virtuous Jewish woman is expected to do, to conduct herself</li>
<li>toward him with love and considerateness, to be under his rule, and her desire will be toward him. Sarwa, out of her free will, appointed as her representative Joseph b. Abraham</li>
<li>ha-Kohen to take care of the affairs of her marriage. Two trustworthy persons, Mevorakh b. David and Jacob b.</li>
<li>Fadlan, were the witnesses of this appointment. This Joseph, the representative, appeared before the elders and testified that he had received from Hezekiah</li>
<li>the preliminary payment of five gold pieces and that he agreed to marry off the above-mentioned Sarwa to Hezekiah with this nuptial gift on the conditions specified</li>
<li>above in this document. These are the valuables brought in by Sarwa to the house of her husband Hezekiah: The gold (meaning, jewelry in general): a pair of wristbands:</li>
<li>5 dinars; a pair of earrings: 2; one finger ring of gold and three of silver: 2; Jewelry: total 9 dinars. (The Clothing) A greenish festive robe: 3 dinars; a translucent veil: 1; a mantle-like wimple: 6;  a kohl-colored ʿaq(a)biyya: 2;</li>

<li>and were now in his possession and under his hand; and that he had undertaken to keep them as if they were his own; and that he would not make any change with them without the knowledge</li>
<li>and consent of his wife Sarwa. He took upon himself and upon his estate after his death responsibility that nothing should be lost or spoiled. The two agreed between themselves that should</li>
<li>Sarwa, God beware, leave this world without a child from him, all that she brought in with her would go back to her heirs from her kin.</li>
<li>Contrariwise, her heirs would have no claim on the final instalment of the nuptial gift incumbent on Hezekiah. They also agreed to keep the holidays by the observation of the new moon and of the ripening of the ears</li>
<li>in Eretz Israel; that they would not eat beef and mutton in Jerusalem until the altar of God is erected; and that they would not apply to a gentile court in exchange for</li>
<li>the laws of the Torah. We made the symbolic purchase from Hezekiah, son of Benjamin, with regard to all that is written and stated above. We have written down all that happened in our presence,</li>
<li>signed the document and put it into the hand of Sarwa, the daughter of Sadaqa, so that it should be in her hand as a proof, an instrument of claims, and a testimony in accordance with the law of Moses and Israel. And they built and were successful.</li>
