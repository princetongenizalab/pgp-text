                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Legal proceedings that took place before us, the court and those undersigned with us on this deed:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the month of Nissan, year 1456 AG (=1145 CE) in Fustat&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by the authority of our lord, Samuel the great nagid may his name endure forever (Psalms 72:17). When Abū al-Khayr the elder&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R. Mevorakh the elder b. R. Meshulam the elder, m(ay he rest in) E(den), known as 'the dyer' died, his widow, ʿAzīza&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bt. Mr. Elʿazar the elder, m(ay he rest in) E(den), known as 'the fractured', presented (to the court) the deed of her ketubah. We found in it that she is entitled to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>552 dinars by way of delayed marriage gift and dowry according to the custom of the land,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i.e. she is entitled by it to a sum of over 250 dinars. We examined whether the ketubah&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contains a trustworthiness (clause) that would release her (i.e. ʿAzīza) from the oath incumbent upon her when collecting [what she is] entitled to.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, we found nothing of the sort and therefore we obligated her (to take) the (widow's) oath when she demands (her) ketubah.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Wednesday, at the end of the aforementioned month of Nissan, she came to the synagogue. We took out the holy Torah scroll and exacted&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the oath incumbent upon her according to all its provisions. By this, she became entitled to what is in her aforementioned ketubah.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Among the things she swore to was that Abū al-Khayr the elder did not leave with her&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anything at all from which she could collect her ketubah. We therefore granted her all the possessions that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū al-Khayr the elder left her, among them that house, half of which belongs to the pious foundation (qodesh).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her husband, Abū al-Khayr, had mortgaged half of this house alongside other possessions for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>200 dinars and sold it in a conditional sale. At his (i.e. Abū al-Khayr's) death, the owner was entitled to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>twelve payments. Therefore, we, the members of the court, permitted her to recover the possessions from the Muslim,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sell all of them to pay the buyer the debt owed to him over the property. (We also permitted) her to collect&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ketubah to which she is entitled (from) what remains of (the possessions), even if it will suffice only for part (of the ketubah).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If she can find something from which she can collect the rest of her ketubah, she can take it. We recorded all of this&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so it will be proof and evidence after today. True, clear, and established. (Signatories:) Natan ha-Kohen b. Solomon ha-Kohen, m(ay he rest in) E(den).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yefet b. Shemarya, m(ay he rest in) E(den). &nbsp;Abraham b. Ḥalfon, (may his) e(nd be) g(ood),&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
