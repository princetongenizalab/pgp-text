She locked us all in, brought the above-mentioned Mr. David and seated him and herself close to the door behind which we were, so that we should hear word for word what each of them said.

How come you sue me for 66? Have we [meaning I, pl. of modesty] recieved from you anything above 50 dinars as price of the house? So why have you made out a writ of debt in my name to the amount of 66 dinars?"
