<li>"And peace with you and peace with Him who support you," etc. (1 Chronicles 12:19).&nbsp;</li>
<li>To brother and friend, / great in knowledge, / beloved and cherished, soul bound up with soul,</li>
<li>engraved on my heart, the great, my right eye, my powerful arm,</li>
<li>his honor, gre(atness and) hol(iness), (our) mas(ter) and tea(cher) Ephraim the ḥaver of the great Sanhed(rin),</li>
<li>/ glory of the ḥavers, who is exalted / among those invited to assemble, / may God be your succor / and place</li>
<li>over you His cover, / son of his honor, gr(eatness and) ho(liness, our) ma(ster) and teacher Shemarya the teacher, who rests in Eden,</li>
<li>the garden of God. From the day we parted until this day I have heard no news of what</li>
<li>you have done for me. No one has told me what has been done lately on my behalf. I remain</li>
<li>like a man locked up in prison, [and] I am causing a burden for the people of the house. Now, you</li>
<li>have always done great kindnesses for me; perpetuate your kindness this time when we meet,</li>
<li>and do not be neglectful, for my heart and eye are counting on</li>
<li>the kindness of the Rock, first, may His name be blessed, and on your kindness. Many scholars have</li>
<li>come here from the Land of Edom (Europe) and from the Land of Israel. Let me be</li>
<li>like one of them among my people. Earn merit for what you do for me. As you know, Moses our teacher, of b(lessed) m(emory), achieved merit</li>
<li>and bestowed merit on others, and the merit of others depends upon h[im], as it is s(aid): "He executed the Lord's judgments</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>and His de(cisions) for Is(rael)" (Deuteronomy 33:21). Time is pressing. If you can</li>
<li>speak on my behalf with the collector of the poll tax, that would be good. If, God forbid, that is difficult</li>
<li>for you, let me know and I shall turn elsewhere, be it right or left.</li>
<li>I fear I will come out of this without a solution and be put in prison.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, above</h3>
                    
                        <p>May your welfare increase like the multitude of the locusts. Isaac, your admirer, asks that your welfare increase.</p>
