                        <ol><li>…</li><li>[…] … ten, and five hundred and fifty and a half Almoravid dinars </li><li>… silver weighing eighty-two dirhams, and a linen Tūnī cloak with a border, and my agent has a claim </li><li>for all that from the 4 of them. We sent an inquiry to Fusṭāṭ and the matter remained in his hand such as it is. I am separating (myself)</li><li>from him concerning what he chooses and effective immeditely, he has … and power in this locale to receive my assets</li><li>into his hand and to release (someone) from the remainder—he alone. This is roughly the text of the aforementioned document which</li><li>was brought to us, from beginning to end; and the text of the witnesses letter for letter and word for word: Testimony which was </li><li>before us—we, the undersigned witnesses. Thus: the Elder Abū Sa‘īd (our) tea(cher) and m(aster)</li><li>Ḥalfōn the beloved b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Nissim the Elder, known as the Elder Abū Ḥusayn, known as al-Tinnīsī (who) r(ests in) E(den) and the Elder</li><li>Abū al-Faḍl (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Amram the beloved b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Ephraim the Elder, known as the Elder Abū Kathīr (who) r(ests in) E(den), and the</li><li>Elder Abū al-Faraj al-Jubaylī (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Yeshu‘a the beloved ha-Levi b. (his) h(onor,) g(reatness, and) h(oliness) Manasseh ha-Levi, Head of the Congregation</li><li>(who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us, and they said to us, “Testify on our behalf and perform a qinyan with us effective immediately, write and sign concerning us with all</li><li>the appropriate legal formulae and the expressions of certainty, and all the language of claims, and give that to his Excellency the glorious Elder </li><li>Abū al-Riḍā the agent (his) hon(or,) gre(atness, and) hol(iness,) our teacher and our master Solomon the honored courtier, the Sage and the wise one, b. (his) hon(or,)</li><li>gre(atness and) hol(iness) our teacher and our master Mevorakh, the Ḥaver (Fellow) of the Great Sanhedrin (may his) m(emory be) f(or a blessing,) in order that he would have from this day forward proof and a legal claim</li><li>that we attest before you with the most certain and perfect expressions of affirmation, in our good health and freedom of will,</li><li>willingly, with neither duress nor force nor compulsion, without negligence or error, nor defect of illness within us, nor anything of the like </li><li>from all the factors which nullify testimony, that we have asked God, may His name be exalted, for guidance, and we have affixed our names,</li><li>and we have received and accepted from him a basket of Dabīqī cloth, the amount of its value being two hundred and fifty-four </li><li>dinars, and ten items of clothing amounting to nine dinars less a quarter, and specie amount to thirty-seven dinars and a quarter (dinar),</li><li>the total being three hundred gold dinars of weighed specie, good and correct, of Fusṭāṭ standard weight. All that came into</li><li>our possession entirely and in toto, that we would travel with it to Yemen and to other places</li><li>to which we might turn in travel […] the good fortune therein, and the benefit—if God wills it—</li></ol>
