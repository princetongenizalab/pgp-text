                        <ol><li>A document was written concerning Abu al-Makārim al-Dimashqī Nadiv b. </li><li>Mevaser, that he will compete in neither buying silk or selling it,</li><li>neither raw nor dyed, and he will not form a partnership in it nor will he dispatch it (to be sold). Whenever it is discovered that </li><li>he did any of these things, he will incur an absolute debt of 10 dina(rs) </li><li>for the poor. He swore a grave oath before us about that,</li><li>though he was suspected of (having violated) the oath</li></ol>
