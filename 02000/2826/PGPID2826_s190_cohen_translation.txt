I send peace unbounded and infinite / and multitude of blessings like sand and dus[t]/, and everlasting covenant which will not be broken, / glorious favor, / splendor and luster, / crown of desire, / joy and delight, / long life and time extended, to his honor, greatness and holiness, our master and teacher Levi, may He grant life to his sons and ful(fill) through their life "May the Lord bless you from Zion; may you share the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life and live to see your children's children. May all be well with Israel" (Psalm 128:5-6).
I inform our lord, may God perpetuate your happiness, that the bearer of these lines, [(our) ma(ster)] and t(eacher) Yefet, is from Fustat. He is ashamed. God the ex(alted) used to favor him, but it stopped, by the will of the Creator, and debts came to burden him. He has family dependents, but it is not his habit to expose his face to indignity. You can tell from his demeanor that he comes from a good family. I ask you kindly to do for him the same well-known kindness that you do for others, and to bid the community to take care of him, since it is not comfortable for him to speak. Accept my personal greetings and forgive us on account of the misfortune that has stricken us by the departure of our brother, (who) r(ests in) E(den), and Sitt ʿAbd a[l-...], may God perpetuate her life, on account of her setback. I am preoccupied with caring for her, for those who came (to be) with her have left, and we see them no more. I greet your sons, and also the elder Ibrahīm, with good wishes. Good wishes, too, to Isḥaq and his brothers, and to Saʿd al-Kohen and his son Joseph. To the elder [...] and the family, good wishes. And peace.
