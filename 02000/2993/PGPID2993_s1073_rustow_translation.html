<li>Those who have authenticated [athbata] their signatures on this document say:&nbsp;We [the undersigned witnesses] happened to be in the market</li>
<li>of Sayfayn when we saw Yehuda al-Rūmī b. Yosef sitting in the shop of Naḥum b. Yeshuʿa,</li>
<li>known as Ibn al-Shāmiyya [son of the Damascene or Shāmī woman]. Likewise, Naḥum was sitting with Yehuda al-Rūmī.</li>
<li>They were laughing and joking around. We didn&rsquo;t know why they were laughing.&nbsp;Then</li>
<li>Naḥum took out a petition submitted in the name of the supporters of Yosef [ruqʿa mutarjama ʿalā ism aṣḥāb Yūsuf], may his Rock preserve him.</li>
<li>On it was a rescript [tawqīʿ]&nbsp;saying it was permitted for them to hold prayers wherever they wanted.</li>
<li>Then he showed the rescript to some of the people present, and they read it while he was [still] holding it and handing it over to no one.</li>
<li>After that, Yehuda al-Rūmī took [the rescript] from [Naḥum&rsquo;s] hand and read it, and contemplated it in its entirety, and laughed.</li>
<li>He then gave it back to Naḥum.&nbsp;When the person with the authority to do so [i.e., the judge] asked us for validated testimony [ithbāt] about what had happened</li>
<li>in our presence, we agreed to provide it.&nbsp;Written on Tuesday, with seven days remaining in the month of Av,</li>
<li>&nbsp;1363 of the year of documents, in Fustat on the Nile.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Wahb bar Mevorakh&mdash;his testimony, written at his dictation.</li>
<li>ʿEzra bar Menaḥem [the document is written in his hand]</li>
<li>Shemarya ha-Levi ben Aharon.</li>
