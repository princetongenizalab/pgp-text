Those who have authenticated [athbata] their signatures on this document say: We [the undersigned witnesses] happened to be in the market
of Sayfayn when we saw Yehuda al-Rūmī b. Yosef sitting in the shop of Naḥum b. Yeshuʿa,
known as Ibn al-Shāmiyya [son of the Damascene or Shāmī woman]. Likewise, Naḥum was sitting with Yehuda al-Rūmī.
They were laughing and joking around. We didn’t know why they were laughing. Then
Naḥum took out a petition submitted in the name of the supporters of Yosef [ruqʿa mutarjama ʿalā ism aṣḥāb Yūsuf], may his Rock preserve him.
On it was a rescript [tawqīʿ] saying it was permitted for them to hold prayers wherever they wanted.
Then he showed the rescript to some of the people present, and they read it while he was [still] holding it and handing it over to no one.
After that, Yehuda al-Rūmī took [the rescript] from [Naḥum’s] hand and read it, and contemplated it in its entirety, and laughed.
He then gave it back to Naḥum. When the person with the authority to do so [i.e., the judge] asked us for validated testimony [ithbāt] about what had happened
in our presence, we agreed to provide it. Written on Tuesday, with seven days remaining in the month of Av,
 1363 of the year of documents, in Fustat on the Nile.
 Wahb bar Mevorakh—his testimony, written at his dictation.
