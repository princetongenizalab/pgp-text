                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>Testimony of what transpired before us, we the witnesses whose signatures are at the bottom of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this document. Thus it was: Musāfir b. ʿAlī, may his end be good, the ḍāmin of [the sale] and dyeing of silk&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Damietta appeared before us and said to us: testify concerning me and perform a qinyan with me from this moment, using all the formulations of claims,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[knowing that] I am not forced, nor in error, nor beguiled, but [doing this] of sound heart and volition, that I leased&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all that I have a right to with regard to the ḍamān of silk in Ibwān, with the force of the sublime rescript that I have in my hands, &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God increase its sublimity and loftiness, to his honor, our teacher and rabbi Yosef the Judge, Felicity of the Yeshiva,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man of Israel, son of rabbi Avraham, may his resting place be Eden, and to the two brothers our masters and teachers Daniʾel and Ḥalfon, sons of Yiṣhaq</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ḥazan, may his resting place be Eden, for a period of an entire year, twelve consecutive months, starting with the middle of the month of Shevat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4866 from the creation of the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and ending in the middle of the month of Shevat of the year [4]867 from the creation, for the amount of 24</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dīnārs, two dīnārs per month. I will take from them each month's installment under the condition that,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whoever makes a claim against them,&nbsp;I will help them against whosoever causes them harm, with all that is in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my power. The three aforementioned elders appeared before us and said to us: perform a qinyan from us from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from this moment using all the formulations of claims that we leased from this Musāfir son of ʿAlī, may his end be good,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everything that was mentioned above. We will pay him for this two dīnārs per month without refusal or&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resistance. We performed a qinyan with each of them and his</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fellow with a suitable item, and as a decree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the Sages. We wrote three copies and gave them [a copy] to serve for each of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a right and proof. This was on Monday, which is the eighth day of the month of Shevat&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4866 from the creation of the world&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the city of Damietta, which is situated on the great sea and the Nile river. It is valid.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avraham &hellip; may his end be good, Mevorakh son of ʿAmram</p>
