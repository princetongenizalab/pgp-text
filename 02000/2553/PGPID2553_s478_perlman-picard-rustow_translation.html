<p>[knowing that] I am not forced, nor in error, nor beguiled, but [doing this] of sound heart and volition, that I leased&nbsp;</p>




<p>all that I have a right to with regard to the ḍamān of silk in Ibwān, with the force of the sublime rescript that I have in my hands, &nbsp;</p>




<p>may God increase its sublimity and loftiness, to his honor, our teacher and rabbi, Yosef the Judge, the felicity of the Yeshiva,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
