Recto
The shaykh Mukarram and the shaykh Abū Manṣūr, (may their) R(ock) p(rotect them), shall kindly deliver to the most illustrious shaykh al-Makīn Abuʾl-ʿIzz the Levite (may his) R(ock) p(rotect him) a gold dinar, which they pledged during a collection for the first installment of the poll tax, to be paid for the pol1 tax of the cantor. And peace.
