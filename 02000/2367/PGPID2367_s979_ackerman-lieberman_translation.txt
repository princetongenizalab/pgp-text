Recto
We, the undersigned witnesses, say that on the last ten-day  period of the month of Tishri of the year 1541 of (the Era of) Documents in the city of  Bilbays situated near the land of  Goshen, jurisdiction of our lord David, the great Nagid in Israel, may his name endure  forever,  the Elder Amram ha-Kohen b. Ḥalfōn ha-Kohen (who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us  and requested that we produce testimony of what we knew  concerning him and the Elder Abraham b. the Elder Ephraim Maghrebī in the writt[en]  documents concerning what he owed him, and [th]at … the entire recorded amount concerning  what he owed him, according to Jewish law and according to gentile law as a commenda (qirāḍ). Then it was switched to the fixed profit which he  would take from him each month as interest on that amount, with a fixed term of 4 years. He took from him the fixed  interest of twenty dirhams each month. Then he coerced him during this period and prevailed over him  with Islamic documents until (Abraham) signed over the residence to him, a sale legally valid in gentile law, for  thirty-six Fusṭāṭ dinars. He testified concerning it in Jewish law with a (valid Jewish) document and a qinyan, to  the effect that whenever he paid him the thirty-six dina[rs] of Fusṭāṭ coinage, he or his heirs, within 12 years, the residence would revert to him or  his heirs. Any remaining (debts in) all (promissory) notes or documents concerning what he owes  him, whether in Jewish law or in gentile law, represent the remainder of the interest for that amount. When he asked us to confirm and verify what we we  knew of what transpired between them after removal of the ban of the glorious judge, m(aster) Peraḥya (may his) R(ock) p(rotect  him), placed on anyone who had knowledge to (the) testimony among them, and did not testify to this in the court, we responded to  him concerning that in order that he would have it and (that it would be) a proof. Everything is proper and clear and enduring.
