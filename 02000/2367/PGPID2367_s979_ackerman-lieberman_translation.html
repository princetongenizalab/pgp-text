                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol><li>We, the undersigned witnesses, say that on the last ten-day  </li><li>period of the month of Tishri of the year 1541 of (the Era of) Documents in the city of  Bilbays situated near the land of  </li><li>Goshen, jurisdiction of our lord David, the great Nagid in Israel, may his name endure  forever,  </li><li>the Elder Amram ha-Kohen b. Ḥalfōn ha-Kohen (who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us  and requested that we produce testimony of what we knew  </li><li>concerning him and the Elder Abraham b. the Elder Ephraim Maghrebī in the writt[en]  documents </li><li>concerning what he owed him, and [th]at … the entire recorded amount concerning  what he owed him, according to Jewish law and according to </li><li>gentile law as a commenda (qirāḍ). Then it was switched to the fixed profit which he  would take from him each month </li><li>as interest on that amount, with a fixed term of 4 years. He took from him the fixed  interest of twenty </li><li>dirhams each month. Then he coerced him during this period and prevailed over him  with Islamic documents </li><li>until (Abraham) signed over the residence to him, a sale legally valid in gentile law, for  thirty-six Fusṭāṭ dinars. </li><li>He testified concerning it in Jewish law with a (valid Jewish) document and a qinyan, to  the effect that whenever he paid him the thirty-six dina[rs] </li><li>of Fusṭāṭ coinage, he or his heirs, within 12 years, the residence would revert to him or  his heirs. </li><li>Any remaining (debts in) all (promissory) notes or documents concerning what he owes  him, whether in Jewish law or in gentile law, represent the remainder </li><li>of the interest for that amount. When he asked us to confirm and verify what we we  knew of what transpired between them after </li><li>removal of the ban of the glorious judge, m(aster) Peraḥya (may his) R(ock) p(rotect  him), placed on anyone who had knowledge to </li><li>(the) testimony among them, and did not testify to this in the court, we responded to  him concerning that in order that he would have it and (that it would be) a proof. </li><li>Everything is proper and clear and enduring.</li></ol>
