<li>
<p>We, the community, arranged the symbolic purchase in her favor in a session of the High Court in the presence of the aforementioned Ḥasan [son of]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ḥasan, confirming his consent and willingness to provide her every month with three way[bas of wheat, plus]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wages for its grinding, and one Syro-Palestinian pound of olive oil every month, also firewood [for fuel, and each week]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>twenty dirhems, worth one-sixth of a dinar and half-a-qīrāṭ. He also has to cede [her the floor on which]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they presently live, while her father-in-law and his wife would move to the middle floor and [no one] should go up [to her].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone would stay with her to serve her. His parents would not interfere with anyone coming to visit her [and whenever they]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would mention her parents, they would add the blessing "may God have mercy upon them." The symbolic purchase was made from the above mentioned Ḥasan in the prescribed form [with regard]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to everything written and explained above, with the annullation of all secret depositions and conditions, out of his free will, without [any constraint. Should he fail]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to provide her with what he has undertaken to do, as stated before, the c[ourt will fine him with ... to be paid without]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delay or remonstrations, until he will fulfill what he has promised. He also took upon himself to [...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and he will not be tardy in this matter, until a letter of his will arrive asking her to come up to him, or that her husband [will come to fetch her].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These obligations remain in force even for a hundred years. This was written on Wednesday, [the day so-and-so of the month of]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tishri of the year four thousand eight hundred and thirty six in the city of [Tyre]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which is situated on the Great Sea. We have written and si[gned this testimony and given it to the parties, everything being]</p>
