On Thursday, the 27th day of Av, of the year 1419, in Cairo, M(r.) Eleazar b. Araḥ (who) r(ests in) E(den), (I)bn al-Shammā‘, and his mother and brother Abraham—his full brother—came before us.We have already assessed everything in the store at one hundredand sixty-nine dirhams, and sugar in the house,and rose marmalade and potions and honey, and its [va]lue—everything along with the value of the dir(hams) in the store—was in totaleleven dinars and a half. This M(r.) Eleazar received all that as a bequest of his father, a half-interest of which would be his,leaving six dina(r)s less a quarter as a financial claim upon him in the agreementfor his brother, the boy, this M(r.) Abraham. The residence //and the slave-girl// remainedand the housewares remained between the two of them. Their mother (is entitled to) whatever she claims, and whatever his father provided for his mother as well—he (Eleazar) has no claim therein. We wroteand signed that which took place before us. Written outside the line: “and the slave-girl”. Enduring.We performed a qinyan with this M(r.) Eleazar concerning everything therein. Indeed, he has no claimfor that with which he will sustain them. He will be good to them. His brother wishedto leave the six dina(rs) less a quarter with his brother as a debt due him.Abraham b. Ḥalfōn b. Abraham (may he) r(est) in E(den)   Isaac b.
