                        <ol><li>On Thursday, the 27th day of Av, of the year </li><li>1419, in Cairo, M(r.) Eleazar b. Araḥ (who) r(ests in) E(den), </li><li>(I)bn al-Shammā‘, and his mother and brother Abraham—his full brother—came before us.</li><li>We have already assessed everything in the store at one hundred</li><li>and sixty-nine dirhams, and sugar in the house,</li><li>and rose marmalade and potions and honey, and its [va]lue—</li><li>everything along with the value of the dir(hams) in the store—was in total</li><li>eleven dinars and a half. </li><li>This M(r.) Eleazar received all that as a bequest of his father, a half-interest of which would be his,</li><li>leaving six dina(r)s less a quarter as a financial claim upon him in the agreement</li><li>for his brother, the boy, this M(r.) Abraham. The residence //and the slave-girl// remained</li><li>and the housewares remained between the two of them. Their mother (is entitled to) </li><li>whatever she claims, and whatever his father provided for his mother as well—</li><li>he (Eleazar) has no claim therein. We wrote</li><li>and signed that which took place before us. Written outside the line: “and the slave-girl”. Enduring.</li><li>We performed a qinyan with this M(r.) Eleazar concerning everything therein. Indeed, he has no claim</li><li>for that with which he will sustain them. He will be good to them. His brother wished</li><li>to leave the six dina(rs) less a quarter with his brother as a debt due him.</li><li>Abraham b. Ḥalfōn b. Abraham (may he) r(est) in E(den)   Isaac b. Abraham (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li></ol>
