                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>[My lord and] illustrious master, may God make your welfare and happiness permanent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[I have to convey] to you, my dear boy, something which I shall immediately describe,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... Abu 'l-Khayr was] with al-Muntaṣir. Al Muntaṣir died [and Abu '1-Khayr disappeared].&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequently we are lacking clothing and food to a degree I am unable to describe. But</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[our relative] Joseph was not remiss in providing us with cash, wheat, and other things. Moreover,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he returned to me the collaterals, which I had given him, so that I could place them with someone else. God the exalted, deserves thanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and has imposed on us to thank Him. You must write him a letter of thanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About the books of Abu 'l-Khayr I learned only in Tripoli. For the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>crate was locked and I learned about its contents only in Tripoli &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I witnessed much bloodshed and experienced everything terrible. I was told that,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as soon as al-Muntaṣir died, Abu 'l-Khayr disappeared. He had books and I [pawned]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his books and yours for 5 dinars. Your letters concerning them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have arrived. If the Nagid&mdash;may God keep him in his honored position&mdash;manages to send&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 dinars, he will do so in the way of charity and thus ransom all the books, whereupon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I shall send them to you. If he (Abu 'l-Khayr) is all right, he will ransom them and send them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[to you].&nbsp;I learned that Abu 'l-Wafāʾ was taken by the Bedouins at the time when his brother disappeared. I am</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a luckless young woman, suffering both by the hunger of the family, and especially the baby girl, who are with me, and by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the bad news I heard about my boy. If my lord, the Nagid, has sworn that he would not go to my aid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and visits on me the iniquities committed by Abu 'l-Khayr, have mercy upon me you, your sister, and your mother,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as far as you are able to do so.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>As far as I am concerned, by our religion, it is better to be captured by the Rūm (the Crusaders), for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the prisoners find someone who gives them food and drink, but I, by our religion, am completely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>without clothing, and I and my children are starving. Now,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do not neglect me. Be mindful of the family bonds and the blood. Show your affection for me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by writing to me. The brother of this man was not remiss towards him, when he first arrived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>here, until he sued them for an inheritance. This led to a complete rupture between them, and no one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of them talks to me ... Miserable days have come upon me. Must it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be so? At the time when I was in Jerusalem, your letters and contributions came</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to me plentifully, as is proper between two sisters, but now you cut me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am writing these lines while the people are on the point of sailing. I have not described in this letter even a fraction of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my real state.&nbsp;Accept for yourself my greeting of peace. And may God extend his peace to my lord the Nagid and my lord the Ḥāvēr.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greetings also to your mother and sister, and to his excellency, your paternal uncle. And regards to everyone under your care.</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <p>Right side:</p>
<p>To my lord and illustrious master [...] Abu 'l-Aʾlā, may God keep him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Left side:</p>
<p>[From] his grate[ful] A[bu '1] Riḍa. Convey and be rewarded!</p>
