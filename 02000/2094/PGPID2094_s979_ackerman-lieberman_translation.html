                        <ol><li>Testimony which was given before us, we the witnesses whose signature is at the end</li><li>of this document: on Sunday, the fifth of the month of Adar of the year</li><li>one thousand four hundred and three years, according to the count to which we are accustomed, in Fusṭāṭ</li><li>Egypt, situated on the Nile River. Thus: (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Yaḥyā</li><li>ha-Kohen b. Samuel (who) r(ests in) E(den) and (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) ‘Ulla ha-Levi b. Joseph (may his) e(nd be) g(ood) and Mevaser</li><li>called Bishāra the freedman came before us, and they said to us thus: “We have sought the guidance </li><li>of God, may His Name be exalted, and we have contracted a partnership (shirka) between us. I, Yaḥyā ha-Kohen</li><li>b. Samuel (who) r(ests in) E(den) and I, ‘Ulla ha-Levi b. Joseph (may his) e(nd be) g(ood) have brought out one hundred dinars from our assets</li></ol>

From this total, this Mr. Yaḥyā ha-Kohen had </li><li>a half and a quarter, which is one hundred and sixteen dinars and a half, and </li><li>from this total Mr. ‘Ulla b. Joseph ha-Levi (may his) e(nd be) g(ood) had thirty-eight dinars </li><li>and a half and a third of this total, which was a quarter (of the total,) to be ascribed to him. I, Bishāra the freedman, brought</li><li>twenty dinars from my own assets, making our total capital one hundred </li><li>and seventy-five dinars and a third. I, Bishāra, (agreed to) buy indigo using all the (capital)</li><li>of Mr. Yaḥyā ha-Kohen and of Mr. ‘Ūlla ha-Levi, for one hundred dinars and forty-five dinars,</li><li>and ground (spices) for ten dinars and a third. I, Bishāra, (agreed to) buy in Fusṭāṭ</li><li>what which I saw fit, with the twenty dinars which I had in the middle (that is, in the partnership). I will travel with</li><li>all that, one hundred and seventy-five dinars and a third, to</li><li>Aleppo and Antioch, nowhere else, as my partners have stipulated for me;</li><li>I have accepted this condition from them. Likewise, the two of them have stipulated upon me that I would only sell</li><li>for cash, neither for any loss nor with any forbearance. I took that upon myself effective immediately.</li><li>I will buy from those places (Aleppo and Antioch) that which God, may His Name be exalted, facilitates, and I will transport it to Fusṭāṭ.</li><li>That which will be mercifully bestowed from the Heavens in terms of profit therein (will be calculated) after paying for all provisions</li><li>necessary for that merchandise. As for my own provisions, they will be that connected to  </li><li>the merchandise with me. From the profit therein, Mr. Yaḥyā ha-Kohen b. Samuel (who) r(ests in) E(den) and Mr.</li><li>‘Ūlla ha-Levi b. Joseph (may his) e(nd be) g(ood) will have two thirds which they will split according to their capital (investment), and the </li><li>remaining third will be for me—I, Bishāra the freedman. I took upon myself—I, Bishāra—effective immediately,</li><li>the faith of the Heavens that I acknowledge the trust in this entire partnership (shirka), and I have not concealed</li><li>anything therein from my two partners, nor have I cheated them at all, nor have I overreached from them, not even</li><li>for an amount equivalent to a farthing. Mr. Yaḥyā ha-Kohen and Mr. ‘Ūlla ha-Levi and M(r.) Bishāra took upon themselves </li><li>[…] and not like</li></ol>
