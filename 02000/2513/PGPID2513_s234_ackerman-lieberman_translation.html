                        <ol>
<li>Testimony which was (given) before us&mdash;we the undersigned witnesses. Thus:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the Elder Abū Sa&lsquo;d the Glazier (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Nathaniel b. (our) t(eacher)&nbsp; and m(aster) Joseph the Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den), and (our) tea(cher) and m(aster)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Manasseh Levi, the one called Abū Sahl, b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Eli ha-Levi,&nbsp; nicknamed Abū al-Ḥasan, known as&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>(I)bn al-Maṭar (who) r(ests in) E(den), came before us, and //this// Abū Sahl initiated a&nbsp; loan before us, (borrowing) from this Elder Abū Sa&lsquo;d ten precisely-weighed dinars&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>of gold, in specie, good and correct, of Fusṭāṭ standard weight, and he received them&nbsp; and accepted them in our presence&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>completely and totally, and they came into his possession as an absolute debt and an&nbsp; outstanding loan, incumbent upon him in his lifetime&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>and upon all his heirs after him, with the most certain and most perfect expressions of&nbsp; responsibility and as established by the Sages (may their) m(emory be) f(or a blessing)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>and he turned over to him a pledge, deeds to his residence, stating that he was the&nbsp; owner. Some of these (documents) were original documents and there was also&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>a purchase document written in his name, and the total number was four documents;&nbsp; Abū Sa&rsquo;d also received them</li>
<li>in our presence, for the ten dinars which he loaned to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The payment deadline for that period was fixed, its specification to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>This Abū Sahl obligated himself in the stipulation, as will be explained, and he absolved&nbsp; him of any oath&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>fixed upon him concerning these ten dinars, the aforementioned debt. Then the two of&nbsp; them contracted a partnership&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>for an amount worth twenty precisely-weighed dinars of gold coin, of Fusṭāṭ standard&nbsp; weight,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>excellent and acceptable, as capital for the Elder, this Abū Sa&lsquo;d, aside from (the capital&nbsp; of) this Abū Sahl.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Their partnership (shirka) for this was contracted for six and a half months, the first of&nbsp; which (being) Monday the fif&nbsp;</li>
<li>teenth day of this month which is the month of Kislev, of the year one thousand four&nbsp; hundred and forty&nbsp;</li>
<li>six years, of the Era of Documents. The established (arrangement) between the two&nbsp; of them is that the two of them will buy glass with the twenty&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>aforementioned dina(rs) of capital, and that the two of them will both work at the&nbsp; manufacture&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>of glass. Throughout the duration of their partnership (shirka), the Elder, this Abū Sa&lsquo;d,&nbsp; will work therein&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>21. two shifts each week, and he will not have any other work obligation; and this Abū Sahl&nbsp; will work&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the rest of the week. Thus will the two of them be mutually obligated in the work. They&nbsp; will labor and they will strive and they will seek sustenance from the Creator, praised be He.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The two of them will sell what they make, and they will buy what they (need to) use for&nbsp; that craft, and they will not divide up&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>till the expiration of their (agreement). And the profit which the Creator facilitates&nbsp; therein after returning the capital&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>of this Elder Abū Sa&lsquo;d, payment for all the necessary provisions for this such as for the&nbsp; fire, and&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the wages of helpers and other (costs) typically known in this industry, will be&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>(split) between the two of them in equal halves. The arrangement between them therein&nbsp; is that (the amount) which one of them takes&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>as maintenance for each day, his partner would take the same&mdash;not exceeding it. And at&nbsp; the expiration of the period&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>of their partnership (shirka), the two of them will distribute among themselves the&nbsp; remaining profit; they will distribute it equally. Thereupon each of them obligated&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>himself to deal with all the monies from this partnership (shirka) which he has at his&nbsp; disposal,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>as is right and &ldquo;the voice of justice&rdquo;. For trust and praiseworthy behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>redeem (one) before God, praised be He, even if one of them does not satisfy the other&nbsp; with something he receives&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>therein. Thereupon this Abū Sahl took upon himself, effective immediately, that at the&nbsp; end of the six&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>and a half months, the period of the partnership (shirka) contracted herein between&nbsp; them, when the two of them perform their reckoning,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>he will not take anything from the profit sent him by God that successfully results&nbsp;</li>
<li>until he repays to Abū Sa&lsquo;d from his total share, all ten dinars&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>of the debt which he has to his credit, as mentioned above, completely and totally. And&nbsp; the remainder&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>of his share after that he will take it for himself. And if it happens that sufficient profit does not come to him therein,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>he (Abū Sahl) will have to pay the ten dinars from funds in his own free control, at the&nbsp; close of one year from that&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>date, //without// the presentation of written proof (of the loan). And if he refuses, Abū Sa&lsquo;d will be free&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>to sell the aforementioned residence whose deeds he pledged to him, as God nourishes&nbsp; and provides at&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>that time, and he will receive the ten dinars&rsquo; from its price. The court has the power&nbsp; therein from him (Abū Sahl),&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>it need not wait beyond this aforementioned deadline. This Abū Sa&lsquo;d approved</li>
<li>of waiting for the aforementioned ten dinars according to the aforementioned terms.&nbsp; And this Abū Sahl acknowledged&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>this Abū Sa&lsquo;d&rsquo;s delivery of the entire twenty din(ars), the aforementioned capital&nbsp; ascribe[ed]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>to this partnership (shirka), and he already been engaging in purchases. We called upon&nbsp; each of them to testify&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>before his fellow to all that is ascribable to him, respectively, as regards the debt and the&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>partnership (shirka), and everything of which the stipulation therein consisted; and his&nbsp; obligation was incumbent upon him, effective immediately,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>(effected) without any duress at all, and we performed a qinyan with each of them to&nbsp; his fellow therein without duress or force&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>or compulsion, with neither negligence nor error, without the infirmity of disease&nbsp; among us, nor any of the other factors which invalidate&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;testimony, with a complete and effective qinyan, with an item suitable for doing so,&nbsp; effective immediately, nullifying any secret dispositions and conditions.&nbsp;</li>
<li>We wrote and signed this testimony and gave (it) to the Elder, this Abū Sa&lsquo;d, in order&nbsp; that he would have in his hand&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;a title of right and proof.117 This took place in the middle third of the month of&nbsp; Kislev, dated above, in Fusṭāṭ&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;Egypt, situated on the Nile River, in the jurisdiction of our lord Maṣliaḥ ha-Kohen, head&nbsp; of the Academy of the&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;Price of Jacob, may his name always be like the moon, established forever. But our&nbsp; signatures were delayed till the first ten-day period&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;of Iyyar //of the same year// and is proper and clear and enduring. Hanging between&nbsp; these lines : for him : other : and established and this is their confirmation :&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;And written on an erasure, &ldquo;on the first of Iyyar&rdquo; : And written between the lines: &ldquo;in&nbsp; the very same year&rdquo; : And all of it is established&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;as well, and this is their confirmation : Nathan ha-Kohen b. Solmon ha-Kohen (who)&nbsp; r(ests in) E(den)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Blessing above and below Nathan&rsquo;s name: (Unintelligible)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Nathan ha-Levi s(on of our) tea(cher) Abraham ha-Levi (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li>
