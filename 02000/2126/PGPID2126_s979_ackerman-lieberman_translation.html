                        <ol><li>Testimony which was given before us—we the witnesses whose signature is at the end of this document:</li><li>on   which was   of the month of Adar of the year one thousand and three hundred and ninety-five</li><li>years, according to the count to which we are accustomed, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. [Thus:]</li><li>Mr. Moses b. Abraham (who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us and said thus: “Testify on my behalf, and perform a qinyan </li><li>with me, effective immediately, using all the language of claims, write and sign it and give it to (his) hon(or, our) tea(cher) and m(aster) A[mram]</li><li>the Elder b. (his) ho(nor,) gr(eatness and) ho(liness, our) tea(cher) and ma(ster) Joseph he-Ḥasid m(ay his) s(oul be) b(ound up) i(n the bond of) l(ife,) in order that he would have a title of right and proof.</li><li>That took place in accordance with my intention and approval, in the soundness of my mind and body and the freedom of my will, willingly, without duress</li><li>or force, with neither compulsion, negligence nor error, nor defect therein, nor disease, nor any of the like [from]</li><li>all the factors which invalidate testimony, rather with a full heart and a desirous spirit, that I transfer to him //effective immediately// fou[r]</li><li>cubits of land from my portion in the Land of Israel as a complete, clear and publi[c] gift,</li><li>given and accepted in his hand from this day forward, and appointing him upon them (my) representative</li><li>agent, to extract and receive for himself that due me with M(r.) Maḥbūb b. Ḥibān,</li><li>being a small leather scent-bag which I sent to him by (our) tea(cher) and m(aster,) this Amram //in the amount of their parcel// a deposit with a formal friend (ṣuḥba) of Ḥassūn ha-Levi b.</li><li>Solomon (who) r(ests in) E(den) in his parcel, and I will take delivery of it (the small leather scent-bag) from this Ḥassūn in al-Maḥdiyya, and therein is golden jewelry (worth) 15 thousand</li><li>and a purse containing carnelians, beads, lapis lazuli, and crystal, and two Muslim rosaries //of carnelian and teeth,// long ones. Likewise, further, I sent </li><li>[…] to me some of its price and […]</li></ol>
                    
                        <h3>T-S 13J8.12 recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol><li>to him before the payment to me […] unpierced […]</li><li>he has, in his document and in his reckoning, six dinars and a half. He promised me that he would send it […]</li><li>after that year, but he did not send me anything neither from the aforementioned six dinars and a half</li><li>the small leather scent-bag which I had sent to him through (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Amram, nor from the pre-existing (debt)</li><li>which was six and a ha(lf), which I sent him by means of (our) tea(cher) and master Nissim b. Solomon (who) r(ests in) E(den).</li><li>He received all this for himself and benefited therefrom and took them for himself. When I brought (the matter) to</li><li>adjudication //and I had// established that he take may legal action from now on in the matter, in the court of his choosing, and to announce and to pronounce a ban</li><li>and to fix testimony upon it, and to swear concerning it or to settle however he sees (fit). Likewise, further,</li><li>I have given him permission to fix a time (for adjudication) and to nullify a time (for adjudication) and to establish legal claims and proofs and to nullify legal claims</li><li>and proofs, that which he sees fit is as though I saw it fit. Likewise, I have appointed (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Amram, or whomever</li><li>he stands in his place, to deliver all that which he receives from this Mr. Maḥbūb in the sea with</li><li>one of our fellows. Likewise, I have appointed this Mr. Amram to release this Mr. Maḥbūb</li><li>and guarantee delivery to him on my behalf //therein,// since I have made his receiving (the payment) like my receiving (the payment), and his settlement like my settlement, and his release like my release,</li><li>and his guarantee of responsibility like my guarantee. Whatever (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram, does this with this counterparty of mine,</li><li>M(r.) Maḥbūb, with respect to all //that with which he was entrusted therefrom// is acceptable to me effective immediately. I cannot say to (Mr. Amram), “(I retained you) to fulfill my (agency)</li><li>and not to misrepresent me.” Likewise, further, I have appointed (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram //to appoint// whomever he chooses of his (own) will,</li><li>that which he sees fit is as though I saw it fit, and whomever he appoints as though I, Moses, have appointed him. I am not able to sue (him) for</li><li>anything he does. Everything that is imposed by the court of law, I accept upon myself, effective immediately, whether for (my) credit or for (my) debt,</li><li>for this Mr. Amram and for whomever he might appoint and stands in his place. Likewise, further, I have declared (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram</li><li>to be trustworthy in his word as two proper witnesses, who is (therefore) not obligated in any oath of any</li><li>type, even rider oaths and even ḥerem setam. He is also free from all types </li><li>of oaths and he is completely free and completely released (from any obligation), both in (my) heart and by means of oral (testament), in this world</li><li>and in the world to come. Further, I have declared that effective immediately his agent will be trusted //as two proper witnesses// concerning the matters of this settlement, and I have taken</li><li>upon myself responsibility for all this—upon myself and upon my heirs after me—for (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Amram,</li><li>and upon his heirs after him, as (this agreement) is not like promises and not like formularies, but rather</li><li>(bears) the weight and force of documents of the court which the Sages enacted and which are universally followed, from this day forward,</li><li>forever, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions which would nullify anything from this power of attorney. We, </li><li>the witnesses, performed a qinyan with this Mr. Moses b. Abraham and with (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram b. (his) h(onor,) gr(eatness, and) ho(liness)</li><li>(our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Joseph the Ḥasid, concerning all that is written and specified above, with an item suitable for doing so.</li><li>Proper and enduring. We wrote and signed and gave it to (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Amram, in order that he would have in his hand</li><li>a title of right and proof. Hanging: “effective immediately” : “if he appoints” : The above is enduring and this is its confirmation. Upon an erasure:</li><li>“and a judg(ment)” : Enduring and this is its confirmation.</li></ol>
