                        <ol>
<li>
<p>I inform our Rabbi, the most distinguished Rabbi of Israel, the singular of (our) time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and its wonder from east to west, that the servant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>married a wife and she brought (into the marriage) a dowry. Her father had&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two houses, a large house and a small house. He wrote the small&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>house in her dowry. After a short while, she (lit. the female servant) sold&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>half of a place she owned and bought from her father the half (of the large house). After a short</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>while, her father died. Her brother took over the small house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(written) in her ketubah and resided in it. I have informed our Rabbi of this&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>twice and I have two fatwas in the hand of our Rabbi (that rule) that the house belongs to the girl (i.e. my wife).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But whenever I demand it (i.e. the house) from him, he binds a zunnār around his waist&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and cries, &ldquo;I am a Christian!&rdquo; One hour he is a Chris- tian and the next&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he is a Muslim! The servant fears what will become of this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His mother, the mother of the girl, sold her the remaining half&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the aforementioned large house. Between&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the two houses is a fifty-year-old staircase. Her son (i.e. the son of the mother-in- law, the writer&rsquo;s brother-in-law) said,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The stairway is included in the property rights of my house&rdquo;, that is the house mentioned in the girl&rsquo;s ketubah.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The servant had to buy the stairway&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the girl with another document in a Muslim court. I turned people against</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū l-Majd, the brother of the girl. So he came to the synagogue,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and our Rabbi Perah ya and righteous elders made the symbolic purchase60 from him, in the presence of&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(21 - 22) Abū l-Fad āʾil the elder, may God have mercy upon him, that he confirmed and consented to everything his (my brother-in- law&rsquo;s) mother sold to his sister.</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>Recently, the girl needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to sell the house, but he delayed the matter and said, &ldquo;You will only sell</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Margins:</p>
<p>(25) the house without the stairway, for the stairway is my property and my possession&rdquo;. He started telling anyone who came to inspect61 it (i.e. the house): &ldquo;Buy the [house without]&nbsp;</p>
<p>(26) the stairway&rdquo;. The matter is ruining her. He (i.e. the servant, the writer of the letter) wants by (writing) this (letter) to put an end to (the brother-in-law&rsquo;s demanding) a bribe and ransom from her and her hunger (?) [...]</p>
<p>Top Margin:</p>
<p>(27) And in a place where a dirham is spent, he spends on it half (a dirham).</p>
<p>Verso:</p>
<p>(28) The servant informed the lord what transpired, so act according to what the noble law requires. May your peace increase.</p>
