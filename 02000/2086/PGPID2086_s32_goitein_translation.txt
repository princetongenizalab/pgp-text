Verso
A good and blessed morning! I have to inform you, my lord, that I have not been successful in educating this boy, Abū Manṣūr. Perhaps you can help me in this. Whenever I spank him, I do so excessively; but as soon as I begin, the mistress rushes along and, after having smacked him four or five times, releases him. Had it not been for his illness, I would have killed him with beating, although as a poorly clothed newcomer, he is entitled to some consideration. He is impervious to argument and not at all quiet. As soon as he comes in, he starts fighting with his sister and cursing her incessantly, especially if I am not present. Perhaps you could threaten him with a little spanking and tell him to be reasonable, well-behaved and quiet. Whatever you decide, don't do anything which might anger your mother and father. 
 
I kiss your hands and greet you and inquire about your well-being. And peace.
