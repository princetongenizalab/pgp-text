                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <p>We, the undersigned, together with Abu ʾ1-Ḥasan b. Ḥātim and the two surveyors provided by the Government for the inspection of properties, were present on Tuesday, the last day of the month of Shevat 1447, when the two inspected the house known of old under the name of Hibāt, which is neighboring the house of Abu ʾ1-Ḥasan. The two houses are situated in the lane known as Laban (milk) Lane.</p>
<p>The two surveyors examined the above-mentioned two houses, the one belonging to Abu ʾ1-Ḥasan and the other to Hibāt and his partners. The examination showed that they face each other and are separated only by the lane, and that the house known by the name of Hibāt and his partners tilts over the house of Abu ʾ1-Ḥasan, causing it damage. It is therefore required that condemnable walls in its upper floors be removed and that a newly added floor in the upper part of the house which overlooks the house of Abu ʾ1-Ḥasan, be reduced. Furthermore, rafters and beams of the house of Hibāt and his partners cleave to the front of the house of Abu ʾ1-Ḥasan and press on it because of the tilting of the house. All this constitutes a damage whose removal is required under circumstances as those described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have written this down so as to form a title of right and proof &nbsp;(Written above the lines : )its upper floors because of the tilting of the house. All these conditions are correct.</p>
