<li>Our beloved and eminent ma(ster) and t(eacher) Aaron the cantor the precious one,</li>
<li>may our Rock protect you and increase your welfare and blessings forever.</li>
<li>Our hearts are unto [you and] our yearning for you is great.</li>
<li>Our entreaties (to God) are on your behalf, may the Omni(present) fulfill them and apportion to you</li>
<li>good things and save you from all snares, through His kindness.</li>
<li>The bearer of this note is Shabbat. He is one of the blind</li>
<li>and receives his share with them. He told us that they cheat him by</li>
<li>taking from (New) Cairo. He [reque]sts that I write to you to look into</li>
<li>his matter with them. May you, blessed be God,</li>
<li>do in this (matter) as you are granted abundance from heaven.</li>
<li>May your welfare and blessings inc[rease] forever.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Perfect covenant.</li>
