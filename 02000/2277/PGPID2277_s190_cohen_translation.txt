Rosh ha-Seder
Our beloved and eminent ma(ster) and t(eacher) Aaron the cantor the precious one,
may our Rock protect you and increase your welfare and blessings forever.
Our hearts are unto [you and] our yearning for you is great.
Our entreaties (to God) are on your behalf, may the Omni(present) fulfill them and apportion to you
good things and save you from all snares, through His kindness.
The bearer of this note is Shabbat. He is one of the blind
and receives his share with them. He told us that they cheat him by
taking from (New) Cairo. He [reque]sts that I write to you to look into
his matter with them. May you, blessed be God,
do in this (matter) as you are granted abundance from heaven.
May your welfare and blessings inc[rease] forever. 
Perfect covenant.
