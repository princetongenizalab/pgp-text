                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <p>On Wednesday, the eighteenth of the month of Nisan 1493 we were present with the sheikh Abū ʿl-Faraj, the esteemed notable, the wise and prudent, son of (his) h(onor), (the) g(reat) and h(oly) m(aster) and t(eacher) Moses, the esteemed elder, known as Ibn al-Kallām, (may he) r(est in) E(den), and found him being ill, but his mind present.</p>
<p>He said to us: Please take notice that I owe</p>
<p>To our lord, our master and teacher Moses (may his) Rock) k(eep him), 2 ½ Egyptian dinars;</p>
<p>Also to him another sum, on the claim of which he is trustworthy.</p>
<p>To the sheikh al-Muwaffag, R.k., 4 ⅙ dinars for the poll tax, which he paid for me;</p>
<p>Also to him the price of wheat, for the price of which he is completely trustworthy up to 10 dinars.</p>
<p>To the illustrious Qāḍī Ibn Sanāʾ al-Mulk 1 dinar and 12 dirhams. </p>
<p>To the illustrious faqīh Ibn Ṣawla 4 dinars.</p>
<p>To Abū ʾI-Khayr of Haifa 5 dirhams.</p>
<p>I am giving to my wife called ... the daughter of my maternal uncle, the Sheikh Abū Saʿd \\ (may he) r(est in) E(den) // the entire third of the entire house in the al-Mamṣūṣa quarter in Fusṭāṭ-Miṣr and grant her complete proprietorship over it on condition that she does not marry again after my death. However, if she marries \\ after my death //, she will receive only 10 dinars of Egyptian currency promised here as the late installment of (my gift noted in) her marriage contract.</p>
<p>He passed away from this illness to his eternal abode.</p>
<p>We have written and signed that which has occurred in our presence so that it may serve as a title of right and a proof.</p>
