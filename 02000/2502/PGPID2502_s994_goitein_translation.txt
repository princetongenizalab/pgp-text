Recto
On Wednesday, the eighteenth of the month of Nisan 1493 we were present with the sheikh Abū ʿl-Faraj, the esteemed notable, the wise and prudent, son of (his) h(onor), (the) g(reat) and h(oly) m(aster) and t(eacher) Moses, the esteemed elder, known as Ibn al-Kallām, (may he) r(est in) E(den), and found him being ill, but his mind present.
He said to us: Please take notice that I owe
To our lord, our master and teacher Moses (may his) Rock) k(eep him), 2 ½ Egyptian dinars;
Also to him another sum, on the claim of which he is trustworthy.
To the sheikh al-Muwaffag, R.k., 4 ⅙ dinars for the poll tax, which he paid for me;
Also to him the price of wheat, for the price of which he is completely trustworthy up to 10 dinars.
To the illustrious Qāḍī Ibn Sanāʾ al-Mulk 1 dinar and 12 dirhams. 
To the illustrious faqīh Ibn Ṣawla 4 dinars.
To Abū ʾI-Khayr of Haifa 5 dirhams.
I am giving to my wife called ... the daughter of my maternal uncle, the Sheikh Abū Saʿd \\ (may he) r(est in) E(den) // the entire third of the entire house in the al-Mamṣūṣa quarter in Fusṭāṭ-Miṣr and grant her complete proprietorship over it on condition that she does not marry again after my death. However, if she marries \\ after my death //, she will receive only 10 dinars of Egyptian currency promised here as the late installment of (my gift noted in) her marriage contract.
He passed away from this illness to his eternal abode.
We have written and signed that which has occurred in our presence so that it may serve as a title of right and a proof.
