<li>In the name of God the almighty.</li>
<li>I am writing, my lord and master — may God lengthen your existence and preserve your glory, support and wellbeing — </li>
<li>from my usual place on the 5th day of Elul in good health and prosperity, praise be to God, lord of the universe.</li>
<li>On this very day, the boat of al-Mufaḍḍal al-Ḥayfī arrived from al-Mahdiyya carrying </li>
<li>Abū Yaḥyā b. al-Sakā al-Mahdawī. He reported that five ships had set sail from al-Mahdiyya, may God bring </li>
<li>them [safely]. If God wills, the remaining ships will succeed in setting sail from al-Mahdiyya, may God decree </li>
<li>the all of their safety. He (Abū Yaḥyā) did not have any letters for you, since others had set sail before him. He reported </li>
<li>that your col­league is prospering and that my lord Abū Isḥaq Barhūn, his father and Barhūn b. Ismāʿīl </li>
<li>are travelling in the boat (qārib) of Ibn al-Munajjā. I do not have the letters for you that they are car­rying with them. A letter has arrived for </li>
<li>my lord Abū Isḥaq Barhūn b. Ṣāliḥ, and I have put it together with the other letters. I will hold everything </li>
<li>that arrives for you, God willing. I have nothing (further) to write to you about. If there should be any further </li>
<li>news, I will write to you. Let (the news) be good, if God wills. I send you my best regards.</li>
<li>I, your good friend Barukh, send you my best regards. I have written a letter to my lord Abū l-</li>
<li>Faraj Nissim that is a copy of a letter that arrived for him. I would like it to be held until it can be sent </li>
<li>to him. Mention this fact in your letters to me, if God wills, so that I know it has reached you. The news</li>
</ol>

<li>is very encouraging,</li>
<li>praise be to God for </li>
<li>this. You mentioned the </li>
<li>cloaks (aksiyya), that </li>
<li>someone had withheld the bundle (rizma). ...</li>
<li>My sufficiency and trust is God in his omnipotence.</li>
