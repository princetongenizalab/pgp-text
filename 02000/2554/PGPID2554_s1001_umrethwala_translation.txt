Recto


In the name of God the Almighty. I am writing this letter [to you] - may God elongate my master’s life, and make permanent his glory, support, prosperity, 


safety and bounties - from Alexandria on Friday, 1st of Heshwan, may it bring glad tidings


and well-being and conclude it [the month] with its perpetuity. All praise for God, Lord of all worlds. I got his (your) letter 


which mentioned the letter of Abū Saʿīd, which informed on the deployment of a bag/sac containing 98 dīnars and half, and a bag/sac containing fur and 32 skins.


 Another bag hasn’t arrived [yet], as for fur I have taken it in my possession and will transport it with 


whoever embarks first from our colleagues, God willing! Hence, do not occupy yourself with it. Upon unloading the packages, 


likewise, I will send them with whoever leaves for Fusṭāṭ [first], God willing! And the ship


named Shawwāl, owned by the Amīr Nāṣir al-Dawla, arrived from Mazara in the matter of 2 days, and  the ship of the Empress (is docked) 


in Mazara. The large ship reached from Tripani and the day it embarked from Mazara, 


 reached my master Abū ʿAbd Allah (Ibn Baʿba) and Abū l-ʿAlā Mufaḍḍal on land. We are awaiting their arrival 


 may God the almighty bring them [safely] and may we hear good news by His grace for which we are forever longing. And the son of the qāḍī


 has still not repaid a single penny and we have been constantly demanding from him. May God gather you with your loved ones soon in the state of well being.
