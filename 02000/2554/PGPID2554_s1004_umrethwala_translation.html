<li>
<p>In the name of God the Almighty. I am writing this letter [to you] - may God elongate my master&rsquo;s life, and make permanent his glory, support, prosperity,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>safety and bounties - from Alexandria on Friday, 1st of Heshwan, may it bring glad tidings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and well-being and conclude it [the month] with its perpetuity. All praise for God, Lord of all worlds. I got his (your) letter&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which mentioned the letter of Abū Saʿīd, which informed on the deployment of a bag/sac containing 98 dīnars and half, and a bag/sac containing fur and 32 skins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Another bag hasn&rsquo;t arrived [yet], as for fur I have taken it in my possession and will transport it with&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whoever embarks first from our colleagues, God willing! Hence, do not occupy yourself with it. Upon unloading the packages,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>likewise, I will send them with whoever leaves for Fusṭāṭ [first], God willing! And the ship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of my master the Amīr Nāṣir al-Dawla, arrived from Mazara in the matter of 2 days and it mentioned the ship of the Empress/Lady turned back/around&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from Mazara. The large ship reached from Tripani and the day it embarked from Mazara,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;reached my master Abū ʿAbd Allah (Ibn Baʿba) and Abū l-ʿAlā Mufaḍḍal on land (from?). We are awaiting their arrival&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;may God the almighty bring them [safely] and may we hear good news by His grace for which we are forever longing. And the son of the qāḍī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;has still not repaid a single penny and we have been constantly demanding from him. May God gather you with your loved ones soon in the state of well being.</p>
</li>
