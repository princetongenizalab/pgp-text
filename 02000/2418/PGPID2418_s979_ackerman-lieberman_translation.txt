Recto
This testimony was before us—we, the witnesses, whose signatureappears below. Thus: on Monday, the twentiethof the month of Ṭevet of the year 1520 (of the Era) of Documents, in the town of  Bilbays,situated adjacent to the Land of Goshen, the Elder Faḍā’il  b. the Elder Abū al-Ḥasan the Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den), and the Elder Manṣūr b. the Elder  Abū Sa‘īd the Elder (may his) e(nd be) g(ood), came before us, and said to us, “Perform  a qinyan with us, and testify concerning us,  write and sign using all the appropriate legal formulae  and the expressions of certainty, and all the language of claims, thatthe two of us have collaborated in responsibility for “Two spans of a date palm”—the perfume  and the dye. We brought out the capital of seven hundred dirhams—from this [E]lder Faḍā’il two hundred dirhams, and from this Elder Manṣūrfive hundred dirhams, and we commingled the total. We establishedamongst oursel[ves that the] profit and the loss would be (distributed) equally, and Faḍā’il would be entitled every Friday  … his partner Manṣūr a chicken and a half-waiba of flour—and fourdirhams of rent for the shop each month. Every “freshening vessel”of the clay-worker will be allocated to the Elder Faḍā’il. We performed the qinyan with the aforementioned Elder  Faḍā’il and the Elder Manṣūr, a complete  and weighty qinyan, with an item suitable for doing so, effective immediately, nullifying  all secret dispositions and conditions concerning all that which has been written and specified  above. We wrote two copies. Everything is proper  and clear and enduring. Judah ha-Kohen b. Tobijah the Ḥaver (may his) m(emory  be) f(or a blessing)  Meshullam b.
