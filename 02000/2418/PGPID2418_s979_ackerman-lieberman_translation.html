                        <ol><li>This testimony was before us—we, the witnesses, whose signature</li><li>appears below. Thus: on Monday, the twentieth</li><li>of the month of Ṭevet of the year 1520 (of the Era) of Documents, in the town of  Bilbays,</li><li>situated adjacent to the Land of Goshen, the Elder Faḍā’il  </li><li>b. the Elder Abū al-Ḥasan the Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den), and the Elder Manṣūr b. the Elder  </li><li>Abū Sa‘īd the Elder (may his) e(nd be) g(ood), came before us, and said to us, “Perform  a qinyan with us, and testify concerning us,  </li><li>write and sign using all the appropriate legal formulae  </li><li>and the expressions of certainty, and all the language of claims, that</li><li>the two of us have collaborated in responsibility for “Two spans of a date palm”—the perfume  </li><li>and the dye. We brought out the capital of seven hundred dirhams—</li><li>from this [E]lder Faḍā’il two hundred dirhams, and from this Elder Manṣūr</li><li>five hundred dirhams, and we commingled the total. We established</li><li>amongst oursel[ves that the] profit and the loss would be (distributed) equally, and Faḍā’il would be entitled every Friday  </li><li>… his partner Manṣūr a chicken and a half-waiba of flour—and four</li><li>dirhams of rent for the shop each month. Every “freshening vessel”</li><li>of the clay-worker will be allocated to the Elder Faḍā’il. We performed the qinyan with the aforementioned Elder  </li><li>Faḍā’il and the Elder Manṣūr, a complete  </li><li>and weighty qinyan, with an item suitable for doing so, effective immediately, nullifying  </li><li>all secret dispositions and conditions concerning all that which has been written and specified  </li><li>above. We wrote two copies. Everything is proper  </li><li>and clear and enduring. Judah ha-Kohen b. Tobijah the Ḥaver (may his) m(emory  be) f(or a blessing)  </li><li>Meshullam b. Mevorakh (who) r(ests in) E(den) Berakhot b. Eleazar the Ḥazzan (may his) e(nd be) g(ood)</li></ol>
