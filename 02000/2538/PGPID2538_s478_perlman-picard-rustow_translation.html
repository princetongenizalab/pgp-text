<li>Testimony of what transpired before us, we the witnesses who have signed at the end of this document, thus&nbsp;</li>
<li>it was: in the month of Tammuz of the year 1489 according to the calendar of contracts,</li>
<li>in Fustat, under the authority of our lord the great Shemuʾel ha-Nagid, may his name endure forever,</li>
<li>we the undersigned made a complete and stringent qinyan from the elder Abū Saʿd al-Ḥarīrī (the silker), (also known as) our master and teacher Ḥalfon the honorable elder,</li>
<li>son of our master and teacher Yiṣḥaq the honorable ḥazzan, may his resting place be Eden, with an implement fitting for the performance of a qinyan,</li>
<li>from that moment, with his consent and without any coercion whatsoever, with the annulment of all secret dispositions and conditions, that he took and received</li>
<li>from Abū l-Maʿālī, son of our master and teacher Avraham the elder, may his resting place be Eden, three and half dīnārs of good Egyptian gold,</li>
<li>in accordance with standard specie and weight, and that this reached him completely</li>
<li>and in full. This is [the amount due] for the month of al-Muḥarram of the year 542</li>
<li>according to the Arab calendar, for the ḍamān of Būsh and its environs. He also took</li>
<li>everything that he was owed by him, namely, the ḍamān of the aforementioned Būsh and its environs until the end</li>
<li>of the aforementioned al-Muḥarram. He owes him not even a single dirham from his previous ḍamān from (the period of) the&nbsp;</li>
<li>previous year until the end of the aforementioned al-Muḥarram. He has also released him&nbsp;</li>
<li>from all claims, demands, connections and responsibilities that were</li>
<li>upon them from the beginning of time until now, those of which he was aware and those of which he was unaware,</li>
<li>those that were known to him and those that were not, whatever it might be or amount to,&nbsp;</li>
<li>a total, complete, definitive, conclusive absolution in his lifetime and for his heirs after him,</li>
<li>from everything that relates to the ḍamān of silk in the aforementioned Būsh</li>
<li>and its environs, and from all the oaths concerning anything therein, grave and simple,&nbsp;</li>
<li>even rider oaths and even ḥerem setam, and then we wrote that and signed it</li>
<li>and delivered it to this Abū l-Maʿālī so that it would serve as a proof and deed in his hand from this day onwards. [Everything is] proper,</li>
<li>clear and enduring [&hellip;] and everything is enduring. Saʿadya son of Mevorakh, may his resting place be Eden</li>
<li>Ṣemaḥ ha-Kohen son of Shemuʾel ha-Kohen, may his resting place be Eden.&nbsp;</li>
