Recto

Testimony of what transpired before us, we the witnesses who have signed at the end of this document, thus 
it was: in the month of Tammuz of the year 1489 according to the calendar of contracts,
in Fustat, under the authority of our lord the great Shemuʾel ha-Nagid, may his name endure forever,
we the undersigned made a complete and stringent qinyan from the elder Abū Saʿd al-Ḥarīrī (the silker), (also known as) our master and teacher Ḥalfon the honorable elder,
son of our master and teacher Yiṣḥaq the honorable ḥazzan, may his resting place be Eden, with an implement fitting for the performance of a qinyan,
from that moment, with his consent and without any coercion whatsoever, with the annulment of all secret dispositions and conditions, that he took and received
from Abū l-Maʿālī, son of our master and teacher Avraham the elder, may his resting place be Eden, three and half dīnārs of good Egyptian gold,
in accordance with standard specie and weight, and that this reached him completely
and in full. This is [the amount due] for the month of al-Muḥarram of the year 542
according to the Arab calendar, for the ḍamān of Būsh and its environs. He also took
everything that he was owed by him, namely, the ḍamān of the aforementioned Būsh and its environs until the end
of the aforementioned al-Muḥarram. He owes him not even a single dirham from his previous ḍamān from (the period of) the 
previous year until the end of the aforementioned al-Muḥarram. He has also released him 
from all claims, demands, connections and responsibilities that were
upon them from the beginning of time until now, those of which he was aware and those of which he was unaware,
those that were known to him and those that were not, whatever it might be or amount to, 
a total, complete, definitive, conclusive absolution in his lifetime and for his heirs after him,
from everything that relates to the ḍamān of silk in the aforementioned Būsh
and its environs, and from all the oaths concerning anything therein, grave and simple, 
even rider oaths and even ḥerem setam, and then we wrote that and signed it
and delivered it to this Abū l-Maʿālī so that it would serve as a proof and deed in his hand from this day onwards. [Everything is] proper,
clear and enduring […] and everything is enduring. Saʿadya son of Mevorakh, may his resting place be Eden
Ṣemaḥ ha-Kohen son of Shemuʾel ha-Kohen, may his resting place be Eden.
