                        <p>In Y(our name,) O Mer(ciful) !</p>
<p>I have written you before, most esteemed teacher, about the two boys &mdash; may God keep them alive &mdash; asking you to pay more attention to both of them, especially to Abu Manṣūr &mdash; (may his) Ro(ck) pre(serve him). He should be able to repeat before me on Saturday all he learns by heart and reads during the week, so that my heart may rejoice before I die. However, up till now, this aim has not been attained. I cannot believe that the most esteemed teacher has not kept his promise in this matter &mdash; far be it from him to break his word! Therefore, in future, please do all you can, and you will earn my gratitude and praise, if God will. The boys &mdash; may God keep them alive &mdash; are late and come to school at this time of day because of the teacher of Arabic. Please do not scold him (the elder boy), or spank him. Peace. And salvation may be near.&nbsp;</p>
