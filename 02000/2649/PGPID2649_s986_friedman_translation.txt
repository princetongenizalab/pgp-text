There arranged a match before us, we the [under]signed [witnesses... X]


b. R. Japheth, (may his) e(nd be) g(ood), with Sitt al-Banāt daughter of X] 


the elder, (may his) e(nd be) g(ood). It was decided that the ad[vanced marriage payment would be X dinars, a gift from the time of] 


the wedding and that the delayed marriage payment would be forty din[ars … The wedding will take place after] 


two full years from this matc[h... It was stipulated] 


that this Sitt al-Banāt, called Sa'ida will be trusted in what she says, concerning her house, 


her ketubba, and all f[oo]d [and] drink, on all, for all, by him during his life and by all 


his heirs after him, like two valid trusted witnesses. There will be upon her no oath 


whatsoever, not even an unspecified ban. And (that) he will not marry a wife besides her nor acquire


a slave girl whom she dislikes. Were he, at any time, to commit any of these, he would be required to pay her full delayed marriage payment, 


even though she be the one to demand to separate (=be divorced) from him as result of this. And (that) he does not have against her father 


any condition or claim concerning the trousseau whatsoever. He undertook also that he would follow


commendable ways and not associate with anyone with whom it is not fitting to associate. If, at any


time, it were verified that he had committed any humiliating act, he would owe ten dinars, 


as a gift to the girl. Her father shall, according to his decision — if he decides, to complete (effect)


the marriage, and if he decides to separate from him. He (the groom) may not produce any claim concerning this, whatso-


ever. We performed the binding symbolic act (qinyan) with him for all this, completely and strictly, with an implement suitable


for performing it, as of now, having nullified all disclaimers and stipulations and after having performed a binding symbolic act (qinyan)


for all this, completely and strictly, with an implement suitable for performing it, as of now
