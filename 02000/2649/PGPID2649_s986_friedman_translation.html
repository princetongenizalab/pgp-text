                        <ol>
<li>
<p>There arranged a match before us, we the [under]signed [witnesses... X]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b. R. Japheth, (may his) e(nd be) g(ood), with Sitt al-Banāt daughter of X]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the elder, (may his) e(nd be) g(ood). It was decided that the ad[vanced marriage payment would be X dinars, a gift from the time of]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wedding and that the delayed marriage payment would be forty din[ars &hellip; The wedding will take place after]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two full years from this matc[h... It was stipulated]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that this Sitt al-Banāt, called Sa'ida will be trusted in what she says, concerning her house,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her ketubba, and all f[oo]d [and] drink, on all, for all, by him during his life and by all&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his heirs after him, like two valid trusted witnesses. There will be upon her no oath&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whatsoever, not even an unspecified ban. And (that) he will not marry a wife besides her nor acquire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a slave girl whom she dislikes. Were he, at any time, to commit any of these, he would be required to pay her full delayed marriage payment,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even though she be the one to demand to separate (=be divorced) from him as result of this. And (that) he does not have against her father&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any condition or claim concerning the trousseau whatsoever. He undertook also that he would follow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>commendable ways and not associate with anyone with whom it is not fitting to associate. If, at any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time, it were verified that he had committed any humiliating act, he would owe ten dinars,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a gift to the girl. Her father shall, according to his decision &mdash; if he decides, to complete (effect)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the marriage, and if he decides to separate from him. He (the groom) may not produce any claim concerning this, whatso-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ever. We performed the binding symbolic act (qinyan) with him for all this, completely and strictly, with an implement suitable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for performing it, as of now, having nullified all disclaimers and stipulations and after having performed a binding symbolic act (qinyan)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for all this, completely and strictly, with an implement suitable for performing it, as of now&nbsp;</p>
