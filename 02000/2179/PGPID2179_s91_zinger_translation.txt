Recto


(1–2) What took place before us, we the witnesses undersigned on this document, on the month of Elul, 

 

(3-4) 4994 AM (= 1034 CE) in Fustat-Mitzrayim, 

 

situated upon the River Nile: Since 


Ezra the elder b. Samuel b. 


Ezra, the representative of the merchants, came to us and asked us to go 


to his sister Mubāraka and reconcile her to return 


from her way [...], we went to her and [... threatened her]


 
Recto


that she would be severed from the congregation of Israel. 


Mubāraka did not pay heed to our words and went to the judge 


of judges. The footmen seized him (i.e. her brother) and she humiliated him. 


He was therefore forced to flee from her. She insists 


on her claims and is stubborn in her insolence, demand- ing 


her father's inheritance from her brother in Muslim courts. 


She has about five men 


supporting her who do not fear God. 


We wrote down as our testimony what we know so as 


to forward it (i.e. the deed of testimony) to the seat of our lord, the head 


of the yeshiva, may God protect him, so he may do what will earn him (i.e. the head of the yeshiva) heavenly reward. Peace be on all of Israel.
