<p>(1&ndash;2) What took place before us, we the witnesses undersigned on this document, on the month of Elul,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>(3-4) 4994 AM (= 1034 CE) in Fustat-Mitzrayim,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>situated upon the River Nile: Since&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ezra the elder b. Samuel b.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ezra, the representative of the merchants, came to us and asked us to go&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to his sister Mubāraka and reconcile her to return&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from her way [...], we went to her and [... threatened her]</p>

                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>that she would be severed from the congregation of Israel.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mubāraka did not pay heed to our words and went to the judge&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of judges. The footmen seized him (i.e. her brother) and she humiliated him.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was therefore forced to flee from her. She insists&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on her claims and is stubborn in her insolence, demand- ing&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her father's inheritance from her brother in Muslim courts.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has about five men&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting her who do not fear God.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wrote down as our testimony what we know so as&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to forward it (i.e. the deed of testimony) to the seat of our lord, the head&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the yeshiva, may God protect him, so he may do what will earn him (i.e. the head of the yeshiva) heavenly reward. Peace be on all of Israel.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
