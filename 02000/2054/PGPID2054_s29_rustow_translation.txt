To my lord the teacher Shelomo b. David ibn al-ʿArīshī, may God preserve him, from his disciple Natan b. //Yisḥaq//. 
I am writing to you, my lord—may God prolong your existence and make your glory, support and benefactions eternal—
from Jerusalem, with four days having elapsed in the month of Shevaṭ, may God make its blessings known to us and to you,
to inform you that I long for you very much, with the greatest possible longing, 
and that every time I pass by the majlis and I do not see you in it, the world oppresses me. 
I ask God not to withdraw himself from you and to hasten my meeting with you in a good state and good health, 
amen. I inform you further that I always inquire about you, in every moment, and always ask 
everyone about you. I attended the lesson of the elder Abū l-Faraj b. Asad, may God support him,
at the time of the two dīnār payment to him, and we witnessed it—also at the time of the half-dīnār payment to him
and we witnessed it (as well). When we heard your news, I was very happy. Your sons 
are healthy . . . the girl . . . healthy . . .. Something that happened
to me, my lord, this year [        ]
and until now. The prices are high [        ] 
His wages were a quarter dirham, not enough to live on . . .  [        ]
almost nothing, inexpensive, especilaly me, who [        ]
here, you used to provide me with benefit sometime[s . . . ] 
destruction of (?). I regretted with the regret of the people of [        ]
this winter, in which I was stuck in mud like I've never seen [        ]
the conditions in which we found ourselves. ...  [        ]
[        ] the only one to my lord  [        ]
[        ]
