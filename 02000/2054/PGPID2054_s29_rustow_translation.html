<li>To my lord the teacher Shelomo b. David ibn al-ʿArīshī, may God preserve him, from his disciple Natan b. //Yisḥaq//. </li>

<li>from Jerusalem, with four days having elapsed in the month of Shevaṭ, may God make its blessings known to us and to you,</li>
<li>to inform you that I long for you very much, with the greatest possible longing, </li>
<li>and that every time I pass by the majlis and I do not see you in it, the world oppresses me. </li>
<li>I ask God not to withdraw himself from you and to hasten my meeting with you in a good state and good health, </li>
<li>amen. I inform you further that I always inquire about you, in every moment, and always ask </li>
<li>everyone about you. I attended the lesson of the elder Abū l-Faraj b. Asad, may God support him,</li>

<li>are healthy . . . the girl . . . healthy . . .. Something that happened</li>

<li>almost nothing, inexpensive, especilaly me, who [        ]</li>
