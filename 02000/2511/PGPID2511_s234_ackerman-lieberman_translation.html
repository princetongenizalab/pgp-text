                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>Proceedings (of what) took place before us&mdash;we, the undersigned witnesses&mdash;thus:</li>
<li>Mr. Kathīr b. Abraham (who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us, and he had with him a&nbsp; document from&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>our lord Samuel the Nagid, the great Nagid of the people of the Lord of Hosts, prince</li>
<li>of princes, &nbsp;Nagid of the Nagids, right (hand) of royalty, crown of the Nesi&rsquo;ut, may his</li>
<li>service be eternal, established forever like the moon. It (the document) demanded the&nbsp; appearance of the widow of Binyām</li>
<li>b. Ibrahīm (who had come) summoning him to the Glory of the Negidut in the matter</li>
<li>of the orphans of the aforementioned Binyām. Indeed, they only have what he provided&nbsp; for their needs,</li>
<li>namely, the shops which their father bequeathed them in the town of Malīj, near</li>
<li>Fusṭāṭ Egypt. That which he assessed for their subsistence has not been collected from&nbsp; their rent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Thus the two judges fixed for them a single dinar each month&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>for their provisions and clothing . They (the judges) released them from the&nbsp; declaration</li>
<li>which their father swore, which was under the care of the two courtiers (our) tea(cher)&nbsp; and m(aster)</li>
<li>Shemariah ha-Kohen, the fullness of beauty, and his partner (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Samuel b.</li>
<li>14. (his) h(onor), g(reatness, and) h(oliness, our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Judah, known as&nbsp; (I)bn Asad, (who) r(ests in) E(den), (an amount) worth twenty&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>dinars which will be in the hand of Kathīr, their paternal uncle, who will trade with it&nbsp; and will add its profit&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>to that which will be collected from the rent of the shops, and he will give them a single dinar&nbsp;</li>
<li>each month. He came and took ten raṭls of silk in our presence</li>
<li>equivalent to the twenty dinars, from the two aforementioned courtiers,</li>
<li>(our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Shemariah ha-Levi and (our) tea(cher) and m(aster)&nbsp; Samuel. (Our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Kathīr b.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Abraham said, &ldquo;Be witnesses for me, performing a qinyan from me, effective&nbsp; immediately; write and sign</li>
<li>for me with all the appropriate legal formulae and expressions of certainty</li>
<li>and with all the language of claims, that I have received and taken</li>
<li>these twenty dinars, and it has come into my possession and custody.</li>
<li>I have taken upon myself (responsibility for) any danger to it; and I will send to the sons</li>
<li>of my brother Binyām, (who) r(ests in) E(den), the orphans, a dinar each month,&nbsp; without&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>refusal or resistance, nor demanding proof, nor&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>defect by means of a defect reducing the payment of this amount.&rdquo; We performed a&nbsp; qinyan with&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Mr. Kathīr b. Abraham (who) r(ests in) E(den), a complete and weighty qinyan, with an&nbsp; implement suitable for doing so&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>concerning all that written and detailed above. That which was before us,</li>
<li>we wrote and signed; and that took place on Wednesday&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the twenty-first day of the month of&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ṭevet which was in the year 146261, in the town of Minyat Ashna,62 which is near&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fusṭāṭ Egypt, which is situated on the Nile River, the jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>of our lord Samuel the great Nagid, Nagid of the people of the Lord of Hosts,</li>
<li>may his service be eternal, established forever like the moon. Proper and clear and&nbsp; enduring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Solomon b. Zer&lsquo;a (who) r(ests in) E(den) Peraḥya ha-Kohen b. Aaron (who) r(ests in)&nbsp; E(den)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Jachin ha-Kohen b. Saadiah (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li>
</ol>
