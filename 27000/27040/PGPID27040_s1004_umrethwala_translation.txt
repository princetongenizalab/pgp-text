In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate
The slave of the lofty presence, the most glorious, respected, and courteous,  may God perpetuate the days of its glory and elevate its stature…..and strength
and doom its enemies <vacat> conveys his obeisance in the exalted and courteous presence, and reports to it
to ask the mighty presence, may God multiply its glory, by granting them the noble decree
