<li>On the date Monday, 28th of Av, may God turn it for the better, of the year 5335 of the creation [=1575], prattle</li>
<li>and quarrel and dispute had happened. Everyone who wanted to be appointed to the duties of the late, the honourable R. Jacob the cantor, because he was the chief cantor</li>
<li>and a beadle in the Bet Simcha synagogue, and a [children's] teacher&mdash;may he rest in heaven&mdash;was found unsuitable for it. None of them was acceptable. He who</li>
<li>wants it stubbornly stood up against our master Exilarch Aaron&mdash;may his Rock and Redeemer [=God] protect him&mdash;and against the honourable R. Joseph al-Tawrīzī&mdash;may his Rock and Redeemer protect him&mdash;the judges. Thus, the aforementioned</li>
<li>judges order, according to what they saw "with the eye of fear [of God]," and chose R. Judah al-Tawrīzī the physician&mdash;may his Rock and Redeemer protect him&mdash;to be a chief cantor,</li>
<li>because he has a pleasant voice and he is expert on every matter; and to be a beadle of the synagogue, because he is suitable for it. He will</li>
<li>serve 3 years without salary; and should obey the aforementioned judges' orders; and he should not disobey them in any religious matter.</li>
<li>He should fulfil the duties of the synagogue's service, as the former beadles have done; and he should fulfil</li>
<li>the duties of the cantorship in weddings, circumcision celebrations, and mourning ceremonies, and should not be negligent in doing any of it, in neither large nor</li>
<li>small matters. He should behave humbly with the congregation and relate to them with a good heart, and greet the congregation, their old and their young,</li>
<li>and not do it lazily. He should not say: "I am working without salary, nobody has a claim on me, and I will do</li>
<li>only what I choose"; and he should serve his friend as well as his enemy, in greetings and condolences and the like. Then R.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Judah al-Tawrīzī was brought, and heard all of what is written about him above, and he agreed with all that was mentioned above,&nbsp;</li>
<li>and accepted it for himself, according to what is mentioned above for the aforementioned period. After that, the aforementioned judges assigned</li>
<li>that it is not possible for any of the congregation (members)&mdash;may they be blessed&mdash;to be appointed instead of him, nor to replace him, because he is doing it only "in the name</li>
<li>of heaven" [= with pure intentions], and there is no option for any to object to him with obstinancy. And [...] everything that was done. All of that happened of their [free] will</li>
