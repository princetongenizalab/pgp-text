<li>This is to inform you, my lady, dear sister &ndash; may God accept me as a ransom for you &ndash;</li>
<li>that I have become seriously ill &ndash; with little hope of recovery &ndash;</li>
<li>and I have dreams indicating that my end is near.</li>
<li>My lady, my most urgent request to you,</li>
<li>if God, the exalted, indeed decrees my death,</li>
<li>is to take care of my little daughter and make efforts to give her an education,</li>
<li>although I know well that I am asking you for something unreasonable, as there is not</li>
<li>enough money &ndash; by my father! &ndash; for maintenance, let alone for</li>
<li>education. However, she has a model in our mother, the saint.</li>
<li>Do not let her appear in public, and do not</li>
<li>neglect her Sudanese nurse, Saʿāda, and her son,</li>
<li>and do not separate them from her, for she is fond of her</li>
<li>and I have willed the Sudanese nurse to her. However,</li>
<li>the younger slave girl, ʿAfāf, shall be given</li>
<li>to Sitt al-Sirr &ndash; but nothing else &ndash; and this only after our debts</li>
<li>to Abu Saʿd and others will have been paid. Cursed</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>be he who acts against my dying wish. (I say this), for I have noticed</li>
<li>more than once that you like the elder one more than the younger one;</li>
<li>however, you know well that I took an oath more than once // and the last one in her presence //</li>
<li>that I shall not will anything to Sitt al-Sirr,</li>
<li>for reasons that I cannot mention, but which you know.&nbsp;</li>
<li>My lady, let Abu l-Barakāt&nbsp; &ndash; may I be his ransom &ndash;</li>
<li>come and treat me, for I am in a very serious condition. Please do (pl.) not act against</li>
<li>anything I have mentioned to you (pl.). Cursed be he who separates</li>
<li>the old servant from my younger daughter, by selling her</li>
<li>or otherwise. My lady, only God knows how I wrote</li>
<li>these lines!</li>
