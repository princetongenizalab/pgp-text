                        <p>This is to inform you, my lady, dear sister &ndash; may God accept me as a ransom for you &ndash; that I have become seriously ill &ndash; with little hope of recovery &ndash; and I have dreams indicating that my end is near.</p>
<p>My lady, my most urgent request to you, if God, the exalted, indeed decrees my death, is to take care of my little daughter and make efforts to give her an education, although I know well that I am asking you for something unreasonable, as there is not enough money &ndash; by my father! &ndash; for maintenance, let alone for education. However, she has a model in our mother, the saint. Do not let her appear in public, and do not neglect her Sudanese nurse, Saʿāda, and her son, and do not separate them from her, for she is fond of her and I have willed the Sudanese nurse to her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the younger slave girl, ʿAfāf, shall be given to Sitt al-Sirr &ndash; but nothing else &ndash; and this only after our debts to Abu Saʿd and others will have been paid. Cursed be he who acts against my dying wish.</p>
<p>(I say this), for I have noticed more than once that you like the elder one more than the younger one; however, you know well that I took an oath more than once &ndash; and the last one in her presence &ndash; that I shall not will anything to Sitt al-Sirr, for reasons that I cannot mention, but which you know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My lade, let Abu l-Barakāt&nbsp; &ndash; may I be his ransom &ndash; come and treat me, for I am in a very serious condition. Please do (pl.) not act against anything I have mentioned to you (pl.). Cursed be he who separates the old servant from my younger daughter, by selling her or otherwise.</p>
<p>My lady, only God knows how I wrote these lines!</p>
