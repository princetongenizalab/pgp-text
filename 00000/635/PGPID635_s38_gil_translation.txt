In Thy Name, oh Merciful!
We, the company undersigned at the end of these lines, declare
 (3-5) that we agree that 1⅔ dinars shall be deducted from the collection from the Estate that is dedicated for the sake of the poor, in order to pay the poll tax of al-Shaykh al-Najīb, our Master and Leader Abraham b. R. Yaḥyā ha-Levi, of blessed memory. Also, that this sum shall be (considered)
 
 
as due him for supervision of the repairs for one year, as the equivalent of
half a dirhem that he used to receive every day on which repairs were done,
(8-9) out of the sum of two dirhems received by the overseer. Al-Shaykh al-Najīb once renounced this half a dirhem and did not receive it during the repairs
 
at the funduq, (accomplished) by al-Shaykh Abū ʿImrān, the Elect of the Priests, may God preserve him forever.
This is a matter in which there is no harm; rather it is of great use, to safeguard him
(12-13) from trouble (caused) by his debt for the poll tax. Also, the repairs to the Estate will profit from his presence and experience. He will be the one to decide what to spend in the course of the operations in a way (full) of
 
integrity and excellent efficiency. Greetings. This decision
(15-16) was agreed upon in the yeshiva of our Leader Moses, the Great Leader, may our God preserve, and our Mighty Rock guard him, in the presence of the judges and those of the elders that were present.
