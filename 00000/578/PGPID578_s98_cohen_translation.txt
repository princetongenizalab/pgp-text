Recto 
(1-2) The Creator, powerful and great, knows how I yearn for my master the parnas and trustee—may God prolong your life and make your honored position and prosperity permanent and crush your  enemies. 
(3) May  the Creator, praised be He, unite us soon through [His] mercy. 
(4) Were I to describe to you—may God make your honored position permanent— how thankful I am to you, and my praise 
(5) for you and my portrayal of  your good qualities, it would take too long. May the Creator—great be  [His] po[wer]—
(6) embellish your praiseworthiness and bestow upon you  a good end. I humble myself before my master the parnas 
(7)—may God  make your honored position permanent—burdening you whenever I have  a request (or: need), knowing that you will act 
(8) on it as you are accustomed to doing for me. The reason for this letter is that I have 
(9) a request,  asking you to represent me and to act on my behalf out of 
(10-11) your  kindness to which I have become accustomed. When I was in al-Mahdiyya, where I traveled a number of years ago, I met Abū Isḥaq Abraham 
(12)  b. Faraj al-Raḥbī—may God make his honored position permanent—with  whom I had had dealings of “friendship” 
(13) and “companionship.”He  spotted in my possession a piece of ambergris  weighing 72
(14) ounces, and whiter than Dabīqī robes. He asked me to sell it to him, 
(15) but I  said: “I will not sell it. Rather, I am going to transport it [w]ith [me to the  East.” He then sa]id to me: “In Syria 
(16) you will get a [b]etter price.” He did not leave me alone until I sold ha[l]f of [it] to him on the condition  that he would do a service for [me] 
(17) wi[th] the part of it that is on my own personal account. He transported the piece of ambergris [t]o Syria and arrived 
(18) safely. He sold it to Tamīm b. Masʿūd for a good price.  He then acquired with the mo[ney]
(19-20) some brazilwood.The price of brazilwood changed (while it was)in his possession, whereupon he  sold it to people from Byzantium (al-rūm) for fifty percent more. I have his letters in which he attests to that. Then he said: “I will carry 
(21) what  is on your own personal account to the Maghreb.” [I] w[rote] to him to  turn over what is on my personal account 
(22) to the son of my brother.  He made two journeys [and mo]re (there) but did not pay (him) anything.  So I wrote and sent him a letter 
(23) with a Maghribī boy named Ibn Benaya, asking him to pay him. I said 
(24) to the boy: “Take whatever he  pays you and issue him a release regarding it.” News reached m[e] 
(25)  that he had paid the aforementioned boy twenty something, but I have not received 
(26) any of it. I am tired of writing so much to him, namely, al-Raḥbī, and having him make me promises and then get the be[tter of me].
(27) News has reached me that he is in Fustat, and I was about to come up [but it was difficult?] 
Margin Right 
for me on accound of my eye (?). Therefored I have humbled myself [before] you and drawn up for you a power of attorney against himand enclosed it with this let[t]er of  mine. I ask you, [my m]aster, to renew your solicitude toward me and  summon him before his [ex]cellency ou[r] l[ord] the ill[ustr]ious [He]ad,  the Nasi, [the Nasi] of all Israel —[m]ay his splendor be exalted and his  throne become great—or before his deputies, and ask him about the piece of ambergris mentioned above. If he acknowledges it, have him render an account of its sale and also what earnings resulted from that and from (the  sale of) the brazilwood. After the accounting, demand from him both the  proceeds and an oath that he has fulfilled. 
Margin Top 
 the trust in this matter; he is obliged to take an oath upon a Torah scroll because he is a partner. Do your maximum on my behalf and do for me that for which I will be forever grateful. Do not flag or show disregard. And if, God forbid, you are overcome in this matter
Verso
(1) by indolence or failure, at  least detain him for me and write to me to come to you [...] 
(2) perhaps Ibn Shu‘ayb and Ibn Ḥashīsh will derive benefit from my coming. If he is prudent he will [not] 
(3) make it necessary for me to come,since there is  nothing to be gained by inconveniencing me. Rather, if you deem it best to meet with hi[m] 
(4) before he appears in court, you should say to him:  “Do not ruin our relationship.You 
(5-6) know what I did for you in the matter of Ibn Ḥashīsh and the other one.” If something can be agreed upon outside of court among you, him, and Daʾūd the son of my sister, y[ou should] all d[o] it. If not, a court judgment  would be the most decisive thing. 
(7) Take on my behalf what is my God-given right, and let me receive your [nob]le lette[r regarding] what you have done in this matter.  I am relying 
(8) upon you as to whether I should come or not. For you and  your welfare and whatever request you might have, I sh[all be] 
(9-10) your  benefactor and beloved friend, if God wills. I wish you kindest personal regards and the same to my master Abū [. . .]—may God sustain him— and to my master Abū ʿAllan Ḥa[ssān?...]—may God [make his] honored position [permanent].
