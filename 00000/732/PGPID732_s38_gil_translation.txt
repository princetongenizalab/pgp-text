Recto


.... 


....appointed my friend, the son…


.....it is easier for me to walk than to ride an animal, so that when 


 . . . . my life, and the indispositions and diseases are over and the body is in good health 


 . . . . al-Mumḥē, may God guard you, that the parnās Musāfir, may God preserve him, 


 . . (donated) to. The heqdēsh belonging to the Synagogue of Cairo 5 dinars, that he handed over


(7-9) to Ṣāʿid rōsh ha-qehillōt, of blessed memory, with which to buy 5 fir trees from Alexandria for our synagogue and carry them here in honor, there being no need to pay 25 dinars for them here. But (fate) decided that Ṣāʿid should not go to Alexandria and he died here, that

 
 

 well-known death. Then we requested the money from his wife and informed her . . . 


(11-12) and recorded the evidence about Ṣāʿid’s debt of 5 dinars and that he received them a few days before his decease in order to buy fir wood with them for the heqdēsh; but death overtook him. So we requested 

 

 his wife, and she testified for herself that we have taken from him more then those 5


 dinars that indeed belong to the heqdēsh, but there is a claim of 20 irdabbs wheat, the market price being of 3 


 irdabbs a dinar; the sum paid 6 2⁄3. The claim also was that he returned 2 dinars by  24 dir., but nothing was recorded to his credit. There should also be included in the 5 dinars 1 1/2 dinar that 


 I took, so that the balance of money owed to the heqdēsh of it was of 3 1/2; therefore, the rest owed by the qōdesh 


 according to the claim is of 5 1/6 So that perhaps you should remind the


heqdēsh . . . . to give her what she claims.


 
Recto, margin


 .... with me Maḥmūd (?) since the others would desire 


 . . . with me. And may your welfare increase for ever and ever, neṣaḥ yeshaʿ yiqārēv.
