                        <p>Your servant Abī Saʾīd kisses the ground before my lord, the elder al Rāṣūy. May God increase your income, stabilize your success and enhance your honored position. May he preserve your boy for you and never forsake you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My lord, had I not known that my lord is possessed of the fear of God, generosity, and high principles, I would not have bothered you. And, by my faith, had not the knife reached the bones, I would not have spoken out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your servant is today in dire circumstances. He (God) knows that I hardly earn enough for eating bread; for I earn only 7 &frac12; dirhems per week, and some weeks even less. I ask now God and your excellency to encompass me with your solicitude with regard to the fees of the orphan boys in my school, three of the wife of the Persian who lives in the caravanserai and Joseph the Maghrebi, for whom already four months are owed without me saying a word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now ask your excellency kindly to give an order to pay me their fees so that I should have something to spend for the holidays. I might perhaps like to taste a piece of meat, for I have not bought meat more than eight times from last Pentecost to this Pentecost. God knows that I would not have mentioned this to my lord, had I not known that my lord does not tolerate such a state of affairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, some little orphan girls live with me who are deprived of everything one needs in this world &mdash; yes, no less than this. Should we not make for them some sort of food for the holiday?&nbsp;</p>
<p>May my lord not be angry with me. By my religion, I have already said to my lord that I regret to speak out like this, but it was called for by sheer necessity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May God let you never be in need but support you with His help. May your wellbeing increase and never decrease and may Heaven give you double reward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your servant wishes to receive an answer without anyone knowing it. And peace.&nbsp;</p>
