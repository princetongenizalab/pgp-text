                        <ol>
<li>
<p>(1-3) The servant, the daughter of Abraham the cantor, m(ay he rest in) E(den), the wife of Khalaf b. Hārūn known as tāj al-maʿālī (the Crown of the Lofty).</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>In Y(our name), O M(erciful),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Happy is he who is thoughtful of the wretched; in bad times may the Lord keep him from harm&rdquo; (Psalm 41:2)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May the creator, may His praise be great, answer the pious prayers for your excellency, our lord, the light of our eyes, the crown over our heads,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the turban of our magnificence, our Gaon Maṣliʾaḥ ha-Kohen, head of the Academy of the Pride (Gaon) of Jacob, may your name be&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ever &ldquo;like the moon, established forever&rdquo; (Psalms 89:38). May He bring about the days of the savior in your lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;May He annihilate anything disg[raceful to you] and destroy those who hate you. May He not expose you to any evil and may He be in your aid&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and increase the shares of happiness which he bestows upon you. May He save you from any calamity&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and may He keep alive the venerable lords, nobles, the youths (i.e. Maṣliaḥʼs children), the trunks of the holy Yeshiva, and place them in&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your station in your lifetime while granting you a long life span. So it shall be done for the holiness of His name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The servant informs your illustrious station of the state of injury,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hardships and harm in which I am with my husband. He keeps casting me out of the house&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and demands from me the iftidāʾ. You know the matter of my father, (may he) R(est in) P(eace), and that my mother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remained after him a widow with not an hour&rsquo;s maintenance. She has no money to herself and only with difficulties&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and by renting out (her labor) does she provide for others. Every time he casts your servant out he leaves me without&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maintenance. It has now been (like this) for eight months. I have been afraid to come&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and complain to you due to the great awe of your illustrious station.11 I am close to perishing.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I seek the aid of God, the exalted, and of your loftiness to examine my state. Either&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he improves his behavior with me or let him provide what is incumbent upon him. For the humiliation (al-hawān) and the hunger&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cannot be tolerated, neither the constant evictions. At the time I was&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>still at home, I suffered his parents, one of them a cripple, you know&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of his situation. Her mother was the one preventing her. The servant does not have from whom to seek protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>except from God and your loftiness for I am alone and an orphan. Act&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with me in a manner that will bring you close to God, may He be praised, and earn you a reward (for helping) me. Do not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enable (him) to wrong her and (their) leaguing together against her. And [peace].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>May the welfare of your excellency increase forever. Great Salvation!</p>
