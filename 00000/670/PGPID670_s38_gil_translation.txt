Recto


I inform our Master al-Shaykh 


Abūʾl-Maʿālī, may God preserve him, that this 


our Master Aaron ha-Levi ha-Zāqēn the son of our Master Joseph 


ha-Levi ha-Bursiqī, of blessed memory, is heavy-laden 


in the compound singled out for Jerusalem, 


may it be reconstructed soon in our times and in the times 


(7-8) of His entire people of Israel. And that he is one of the first Jerusalemites, there being no doubt nor suspicion concerning him. 

 

He is requesting (his due) from (the man) who (is in charge) of the allocations of the compounds  


(10-11) of the Jerusalemites, since he is in a great distress. He declares that if he


 


received his share now 


(13-14) he would disengage himself with it (of his distress) and at the time of the (regular) distribution he would not request anything. So please write 

 

a note to R. Solomon ha-Melammēd 


regarding (the sum) that you consider proper. 


Greetings.
