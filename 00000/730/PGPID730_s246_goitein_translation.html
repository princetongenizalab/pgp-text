<li>
<p>This is what we ask your excellency, our master, the prominent Rav, may God make your exalted position permanent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your leadership solid. Please let us have your legal opinion about what has to be done in the following matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A long time ago, female captives, among them little girls, arrived here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman took a little girl into her house in order to bring her up, doing this as a pious work. That woman had</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three virgin girls and two boys, grown up bachelors. She brought the girl up,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who stayed with her five or four years until she came of age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[One of the two boys] of that woman asked for her hand. They consulted the local judge, (may) G(od) k(eep him), whether this marriage was permissible. He said:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"It is." They arranged the marriage and gave her as outfit whatever God had blessed them with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[However, after the marria]ge she did not stay with her husband longer than four</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[weeks and re]turned to the house of the woman, in which she had been brought up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[...] and said: I shall not stay with this man one single hour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[The elders and the jud]ge, (may) G(od) k(eep him) urged her all the time to reconsider the matter, but she said:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[...]. They exercised on her all kinds of pressure and talked to her in different</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ways, but she said: "I shall not stay with this] man even if he pours gold over my head."&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[...]. Then the woman's children drove her out of the house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[...] she did not agree, but [...].&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
