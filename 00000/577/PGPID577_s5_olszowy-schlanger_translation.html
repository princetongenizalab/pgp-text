<li><span lang="en">This is the formula of the Egyptian ketubba</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">of the Karaites.</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">In the name of the Everlasting God. The God made him prosper (II Chron. 26: 5). In the Lord</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">they will be justified (Is. 45: 25). The Mighty God will look from His elevated heaven, and will zealously defend</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the sanctity of His name. He will rebuild His temple and His hall, and return</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">His Glory to His throne. He will bring Şemaḥ, may his name increase, and promptly gather together</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the dispersed ones of His people, Amen. Let us begin in the</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">appropriate and lucky moment, in the lifetime of our Lord Şemaḥ, the nāsī,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the descendent of the Man of Rest, and in the lifetime of the groom and the bride, the light</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and joy, and in the lifetime of the Karaites, the blossoming vine.</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">On the day so-and-so of the week which is day so-and-so of the month</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">so-and-so, of the year one thousand three hundred forty</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">seven of the era of the Greeks, in the land of Egypt,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">in the city of Fusṭāṭ which is situated on the river Nile.</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">On this day so-and-so son of so-and-so, the groom, declared about himself before</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">the elders who sign below in this document, in a qinyan, according to the will</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">of his soul, desire, wish and aspiration, and he is not coerced, not mistaken,</span></li>

<li><span lang="en">above, and that she took upon herself all the conditions they stipulated between them.</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">And so-and-so son of so-and-so, the agent, came and took us for witnesses about himself, in a qinyan, according to his will</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and wish, that he betrothed the aforementioned such-and-such, the young girl, the virgin, daughter of so-and-so</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">to so-and-so son of so-and-so, to be his wife and companion according to the custom of the pure, faithful and suitable daughters of Israel</span></li>

<li><span lang="en">and holiness, by the mohar mentioned above, on the conditions mentioned in this deed</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">of betrothal. May they build and prosper, and rejoice in the joy of Jerusalem, the city of the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">Zion, the holy of Israel. O Lord, please, save us, make us prosper.</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">And this is the opening of the beginning of the document of betrothal. In the lifetime of our Lord, His Glory, Highness,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">Holiness, Ṣemaḥ, the nāsī, son of his Glory, Highness, Holiness, the nāsī, 'Asā, and in the lifetime of the fiancé</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and the fiancée, their Rock will increase their soul and rejoice. O God, do not despise, do not disdain the dispersed ones</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">but gather them together promptly from all the parts, Amen. This is the formula</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">for a Karaite woman and a Rabbanite man. And that he will not bring to his house</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">where she dwells as his wife, the fat tail, the two kidneys and the lobe</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">of the liver, nor the meat of a pregnant animal, or the bread of the Gentiles,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">or their wine, or their abomination. And he will not light the candle on Sabbath evenings,</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and there will be no fire in his house on Sabbaths and he will not make love with her on Sabbaths</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">and festivals, as if they were week days. He will not force her</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">to profane the festivals of the Lord of the Hosts, according to the sighting of the Moon and the finding</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">of the aviv in the Land of Israel, because she is from the Karaites and belongs to their custom. And if</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">he breaks and changes anything from these arrangements, he will have to pay the delayed mohar</span></li>
<li><span lang="en">at the request [of divorce] issued when he breaks the arrangement. And she will have</span></li>
