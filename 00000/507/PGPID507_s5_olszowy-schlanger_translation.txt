… this affair, in a full, valid qinyan, and also in addition
… her ketubba. The total of the belongings including half a house
… and a half. And Solomon ben ᶜAmram declared before
… [that] all these belongings arrived to his house, and together with the half of the house
… [are under his jurisdiction, with him] and in his possession, and that he took upon himself to keep them
[like everything that belongs to him, and will not change anything from them] without the knowledge of his wife, and without her consent.
[He also took upon himself the responsibility for this ketubba] and upon his estate after him, except for what
[is lost or worn out. And if], God forbid, this Ḥusn leaves this world
[without a child from this husband of hers, all that] she brought with her will return to her heirs from her paternal family, and
[this Solomon, her husband, will not owe] anything from the delayed mohar. And they united themselves in agreement
[both together, that they will behave] in purity and honesty, and that they will observe
[the festivals of the Lord according to the sighting of the Moon, and finding] the aviv in the Land of Israel. And we performed the qinyan with
[the dear groom, Solomon ben ᶜAmram], about what is written and explained above
[and we wrote, signed and gave to Ḥusn daughter of] David, to be in her possession as a proof, and right and testimony,
[according to the custom of Moses and Israel, may they build] and prosper. There follow the names of the witnesses
