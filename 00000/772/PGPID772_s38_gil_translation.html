<li>
<p>There were present (in court) Ṣubḥ and his wife and it was legally acquired from both of them that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they relinquish any claim to the 9 qīrāṭs of&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the compound known as Dār al-Ṣabbāgh,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shirkat al-ʿAniyīm, which is in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the lane of al-Ḥarrānī. The two of them will in no way&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sell, or donate, or rent it,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or bring in tenants, or collect any&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rent, until our Master Isaiah has received the full acquittal&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of what he will say .. of theirs, namely those 9 (qīrāṭs)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;There were present Ṣubḥ and his wife and it was legally acquired&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from both of them together that they&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(12-14) accepted that the Honorable al-Shaykh (A)bū Naṣr, our Master Isaiah, the administrator of the Estate of the Poor, should handle for them the repairs of 1&frasl;4 + 1/8 of the compound&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>owned by them in Fustat, in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ, in the lane&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of al-Ḥarrānī, known as Dār b. al-Ṣabbāgh. Also, that they will fully trust him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>regarding (the sum) which, he will say, was spent for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(18-19) the said repairs, just as (one would trust) two able and trustworthy witnesses. They allowed him (to do) whatever he&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>would find necessary regarding this (matter). Both of them together&hellip;.</p>
