There were present (in court) Ṣubḥ and his wife and it was legally acquired from both of them that 


they relinquish any claim to the 9 qīrāṭs of 


the compound known as Dār al-Ṣabbāgh, 


Shirkat al-ʿAniyīm, which is in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ 


in the lane of al-Ḥarrānī. The two of them will in no way 


sell, or donate, or rent it, 


or bring in tenants, or collect any 


rent, until our Master Isaiah has received the full acquittal 


of what he will say .. of theirs, namely those 9 (qīrāṭs) 


 There were present Ṣubḥ and his wife and it was legally acquired 


from both of them together that they 


(12-14) accepted that the Honorable al-Shaykh (A)bū Naṣr, our Master Isaiah, the administrator of the Estate of the Poor, should handle for them the repairs of 1⁄4 + 1/8 of the compound 

 
 

owned by them in Fustat, in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ, in the lane 


of al-Ḥarrānī, known as Dār b. al-Ṣabbāgh. Also, that they will fully trust him 


regarding (the sum) which, he will say, was spent for 


(18-19) the said repairs, just as (one would trust) two able and trustworthy witnesses. They allowed him (to do) whatever he 

 

would find necessary regarding this (matter). Both of them together….
