may He cover them with the cover of His wings, what all the comm[uniti]es of Israel have contributed, may God bless them and what they have done concerning the captives, may God release them from imprisonment. 
We are [sending] you a letter with the honorable, his h(onor), g(reatness), (and) h(oliness), our master and teacher Aaron ha-Levi, the hon(orable), the excellent scribe, (may his) R(ock) p(rotect him). He will read it to the community. He is accompanied by a parnas sent from our midst. When he reads it to you, my brothers, take heed of it as is to be expected from the likes of you, and you will gain thereby the great reward. Act upon it in the same way as we, all the judges and the elders and the student(s), have all acted, going around, night and day, urging people in the synagogues, the markets, and at the doors of dwellings, in order to collect something toward this great goal. Having contributed as much as we ourselves are able, you, too, should do for them as befits your generosity and your [renown] as seekers of merit [through] kindness and 1ove. Write to tell us the total amount you obtain on their behalf, through God the ex(alted's) favor and your own. Exert yourselves to collect it quickly and send it to us with our above-mentioned dignitary, R. Aaron ha-Levi. You do not need anyone to goad you to perform religious duties. May God the exa(lted) not let you experience adversity and may he protect you and enfold you with his abundant mercy, May your welfare increase forever. Tamm[uz] (1)480 (of the Era of Documents). 
Moses the son of Maimon, (may the) m(emory of the) r(ighteous) be (blessed).
