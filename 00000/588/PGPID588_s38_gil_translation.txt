Recto


The honorable elders declare that they 


settled the account of al-Nādīv, the result 


of the account being that there is a balance to his credit 


to the end of Shaʿbān for 


the repairs, 19 1⁄2 (dinars) in gold 


owed by the qōdesh. Of this, 


9 3/4 (dinars) in gold he owes the qōdesh. (Also) for the lease 


for 4 months, ending 


(9-10) Dhūʾl-ḥijja, he owes the qōdesh 3 dinars. (Balance,) 6 3⁄4 (dinars) in gold. 

 

So they agreed that he spend 


on his own for the repair  of his brewery 


10 1/2 dinars, the share of 


the qōdesh in it being 5 1/2 (dinars). Then 


the qōdesh will have to refund him 12 (dinars) in gold. 


(16-17) It was agreed also that he has another dinar to be divided in two, and it was agreed that he will purchase 

 

a pair of pillars for the room; 


whatever price he pays he will not charge 


the qōdesh more than 


a cost of 1 dinar. 


 
Verso


The marble of the balustrade 


of beneath the bādhanj 


will also have its total (cost) divided in two. 


He rented half 


of the compound for 3⁄4 


dinar a month. We will deduct 


from the 12 dinars 3⁄4 (dinar) 


for 16 months beginning Muḥarram 


of the year [5]51. We will write on this 


a deed of lease in a Muslim court.


Therefore we, who have signed 


at the bottom of this note, asked al-Nādīv 


about all these matters and he agreed (to it) 


before us entirely and made us witness 


for himself regarding all of it 


and instructed us to record it to his charge. 


Accordingly, we confirmed it during


the middle ten days of Adar riʾshōn 


1467. Ephraim b. R. Meshullām.
