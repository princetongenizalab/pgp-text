Recto

I am writing — may God lengthen the existence of my lord the ḥaver, the illustrious member of the yeshiva, may God lengthen 
his existence and make eternal his glory, support, happiness, benefaction and protection
and smite your enemies — from Alexandria, with two days left in Tammuz — may God conclude it 
for us and for you in the most favorable manner — in a state of good health and wellbeing, but longing 
for you, may God in his kindness and blessing bring near the time of our meeting in the best of cir­cumstances.
I inform my lord that I previously sent to you some letters in which I informed you of what I did 
with respect to the yarn (ghazl). I have had it made for you into a large turban, 25 cubits long, and into a bolt of cloth (shuqqa) 20 
cubits long. I received 31 dirhams from ʿAwwāḍ, which I paid to the artisan for 
the bolt of cloth and the large turban. I also paid 4 dirhams for the unravelling of the yarn. After he had completed the work, 
I succeeded in getting the craftsmen to reduce the price by 3 dirhams.  I will use this sum to pay the bleacher (muṣaffī). After 
this had transpired, ʿAṭiya b. Shammāʿx carrying with him a blue wrapping cloth (khirqa) which contained a quantity of cotton, yarn and combed flax (kattan manfush).  I weighed the combed flax and it came to 11 'uqiva.  I will have this spun for you at the cost of one-half an 'ugiya (i.e., I will pay the spinner 1/2 'uqiva for his labor, instead of paying him in cash).  I have already informed you that there still remains one and a quarter ratl misri of your yarn that was not used by the artisan (i.e. the weaver).  I will collect all (the remaining yarn) and prepare it (for the weaving) of another bolt of cloth.
I have also informed you of the circumstances concerning the cloak (milhafa).  The flax from which it was woven was of dif­ferent qualities, and consequently its "whitening" (tabvid) was not uniform and it has a brown coloring.  If you wish to have it bleached and fulled (cleansed), please inform me accordingly in your next letter; otherwise, I can send it to you as it is.
I had reached an agreement with the artisan who wove the cloak that he would do this for 22 qirat and I subsequently received an additional discount of two and one-half dirhams.  I paid him a half dirham for the unravelling of the yarn and for a dirham-weight of silk.  His (total) fee came to 37 and one-half dirhams.
Thirty dirham-weights of the cotton belonging to you remain as they are - untouched.
[In my letter] I asked you about the delivery of the Tabari cloak and requested that you get its price from Abu Yusuf. Please let me know in your letter whether or not you have col­lected any money.  I send you my best regards.
Greeting to R. Nissim, may God preserve his life; and greet­ings to Abu Yusuf at-Trablusi and his brother. And I, Marduk b. Musa, send special greetings to you and to R. Nissim. God is my sufficiency.
Address
My lord, the haver. R. Nahray b. Nissim
May God prolong his life and preserve his glory and grace.
From the one who is grateful for his kindness, Marduk b. Musa.
