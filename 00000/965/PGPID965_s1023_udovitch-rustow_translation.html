                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I am writing &mdash; may God lengthen the existence of my lord the ḥaver, the illustrious member of the yeshiva, may God lengthen</li>
<li>his existence and make eternal his glory, support, happiness, benefaction and protection</li>
<li>and smite your enemies &mdash; from Alexandria, with two days left in Tammuz &mdash;&nbsp;may God conclude it</li>
<li>for us and for you in the most favorable manner &mdash; in a state of good health and wellbeing, but longing</li>
<li>for you, may God in his kindness and blessing bring near the time of our meeting in the best of cir&shy;cumstances.</li>
<li>I inform my lord that I previously sent to you some letters in which I informed you of what I did</li>
<li>with respect to the yarn (ghazl). I have had it made for you into a large turban, 25 cubits long, and into a bolt of cloth (shuqqa) 20</li>
<li>cubits&nbsp;long. I received 31 dirhams from ʿAwwāḍ,&nbsp;which I paid to the artisan for</li>
<li>the bolt of cloth and the large turban. I also paid 4 dirhams for the unravelling of the yarn. After he had completed the work,</li>
<li>I succeeded in getting the craftsmen to reduce the price by 3 dirhams.&nbsp; I will use this sum to pay the bleacher (muṣaffī). After</li>
<li>this had transpired, ʿAṭiya b. Shammāʿ arrived carrying with him a blue wrapping cloth (khirqa) that contained cotton,</li>
<li>yarn and combed flax (kattān manfūsh). I weighed the combed flax and it came to 11 ʿuqiyya. I</li>
<li>will have this spun for you at the cost of one-half an ʿuqiyya (i.e., I will pay the spinner 1/2 ʿuqiyya for his labor, instead of paying him in cash). I have already informed you that there still remains</li>
<li>one and one-quarter raṭl miṣrī of your yarn that was not used by the artisan. I will collect all (the remaining yarn) for you and prepare it (for the weaving)</li>
<li>of another bolt of cloth.&nbsp;I have also informed you of the circumstances concerning the cloak (milḥafa). The flax from which it was woven</li>
<li>was of dif&shy;ferent qualities, and consequently its "whitening" (tabyīḍ) was not uniform and it has a brown coloring. If you wish</li>
<li>to have it bleached and fulled, please inform me accordingly in your next letter; otherwise, I can send it to you as it is.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto - right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I had reached an agreement with</li>
<li>the (artisan) who wove (the cloak that he would do this for)</li>
<li>22 qirat and I subsequently</li>
<li>received an additional discount of two qīrāṭs.</li>
<li>I then paid him, in addition</li>
<li>to the two qīrāṭs, two</li>
<li>and a half dirhams</li>
<li>and paid half a dirham</li>
<li>for the unravelling of the yarn</li>
<li>and for a dirham-weight of silk.&nbsp;</li>
<li>His (total) fee came to</li>
<li>37 and a half dirhams.</li>
<li>There remain to you</li>
<li>thirty dirham-weights of the cotton</li>
<li>as they are,</li>
<li>untouched.</li>
<li>I asked</li>
<li>you, my lord,</li>
</ol>
