                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I am writing, may God prolong the existence of my lord the elder and make eternal his glory,</li>
<li>support, happiness and wellbeing,&nbsp;from Alexandria on Sunday,</li>
<li>with 8 days remaining in the month of [...],&nbsp;may God conclude it for you and for us in the most favorable manner, in a state of</li>
<li>wellbeing and health; may God bring near the time of a meeting between us in the most favorable</li>
<li>of circumstances. I have already informed you, my lord, that I have previously sent you a letter in which I communicated to you</li>
<li>the situation with respect to the 13 purses that I have with me: they are finished, praise be to God.</li>
<li>Among them was a purse on which was written the name of Yūsuf [b. Barhun?], and a second,&nbsp;</li>
<li>mixed purse with your name and his name on it; and a third purse upon which</li>
<li>is written, "From Mūsā b. Yaḥyā." I do not know, my lord,</li>
<li>to whom this last bag belongs.&nbsp;In your letter, inform me to whom this third purse belongs. I asked,</li>
<li>my lord, in my previous letter that you purchase for me</li>
<li>sandals with two straps (zimāmayn), and also&nbsp;for Abū ʿImrān and Abū l-Faḍl.</li>
<li>Before I travelled (from Cairo to Alexandria), you said to me: "I will have</li>
<li>a pair of rural (rīfī) sandals made for you." Please send them. Also, purchase for me</li>
<li>a raṭl of pepper, a raṭl of cinnamon, two quires (dastayn) of paper, bayān ink,</li>
<li>and an inkstand [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]. They should be round, so that they can be used for a leather bag.</li>
<li>I would like, my lord, for you to acquire these items one at a time, until I have received them all.</li>
<li>On this very day, the barge (qārib) of Ibn Mulayka arrived</li>
<li>from Lukk (eastern Libya). He (the captain of the vessel?) mentioned that the amīr Jubbāra returned the ship and all</li>
<li>the heavy cargo that he had removed to Barqa. I hope that this information is correct.</li>
<li>I ask God to reunite all those who had goods in this ship with their goods.</li>
<li>Prior to his departure, Ibn ʿUqbān left me instructions to dispatch one-sixth [...].&nbsp;</li>
<li>I have learned that the [...] that I sent with him the elder Abu Saʿd</li>
<li>has done something that distresses him. By God, this has greatly distressed me.</li>

<li>I would like you, my lord, to send</li>
<li>me these items,</li>
<li>for I am in need of them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>I am walking around barefoot.</li>
<li>Please let me know how much</li>
<li>you fetched for the</li>
<li>wrap (mayzar). If</li>
<li>my lord has</li>
<li>any requests</li>

<li>I send you my best regards.&nbsp; My best regards to the Rabbi; tell him of my yearnings for him.&nbsp; Likewise, to my lord the elder, Abu Zikri.&nbsp; Tell the latter the story about the ship.&nbsp; I hope it is correct.&nbsp; And place.</li>
