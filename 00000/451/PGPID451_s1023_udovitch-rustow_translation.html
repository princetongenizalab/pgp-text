<li>I am writing, may God prolong the existence of my lord the elder and make eternal his glory, </li>
<li>support, happiness and wellbeing, from Alexandria on Sunday, </li>
<li>with 8 days remaining in the month of [...], may God conclude it for you and for us in the most favorable manner, in a state of </li>
<li>wellbeing and health; may God bring near the time of a meeting between us in the most favorable </li>
<li>of circumstances. I have already informed you, my lord, that I have previously sent you a letter in which I communicated to you</li>
<li>the situation with respect to the 13 purses that I have with me: they are finished, praise be to God.</li>
<li>Among them was a purse on which was written the name of Yūsuf [b. Barhun?], and a second, </li>
<li>mixed purse with your name and his name on it; and a third purse upon which</li>
<li>is written, "From Mūsā b. Yaḥyā." I do not know, my lord,</li>
<li>to whom this last bag belongs. In your letter, inform me to whom this third purse belongs. I asked, </li>
<li>my lord, in my previous letter that you purchase for me</li>
<li>sandals with two straps (zimāmayn). Before I travelled (from Cairo to Alexandria) you said to me: "I will have a pair of rural (=rifi) sandals (shoes) made for you." Please send them.  Also, purchase for me a ratl of pepper, and a ratl of cinnamon, and two quires of paper and bayan ink, and an inkstand [     ]           they should be round, so that they can be used for a leather bag.  I will be grateful, my lord, as you acquire these items one at a time, until I have received them all.</li>
</ol>
<p>On this very day the barge of Ibn Mulayka arrived from Lukk. He (presumably the captain of the vessel) mentioned that the Amir Jubbara returned the ship and all the heavy cargo which he had removed to Barqa.  I hope that this information is correct.  I pray that God will reunite with their goods all those who had goods in this ship.</p>
<p>Prior to his departure, Ibn <sup>x</sup>Uqban left me instructions with respect to the dispatch of one-sixth [..]•  I have learned that the [....] which I sent with him [       ] the elder Abu Sa<sup>x</sup>d [ ] has done something which distresses him.  By God, this has greatly distressed me.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to you were you to send me these items, for I am in great need of them.  I am walking around barefoot. Please let me know how much you fetched for the sari (mayzar). f my lord has any requests, please honor me with their execution</p>
<p>I send you my best regards.  My best regards to the Rabbi; tell him of my yearnings for him.  Likewise, to my lord the elder, Abu Zikri.  Tell the latter the story about the ship.  I hope it is correct.  And place.</p>
