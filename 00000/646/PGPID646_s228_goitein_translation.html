                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>And as far as the argument in favor of the two synagogues and the two authorities is concerned, (it has already been refuted by) Ibn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sijilmasi, for when two authorities are permissible, there would be permissible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three and even more, and this would lead to endless anarchy,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the robbing of land and goods, to the rape of women and the end of rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefaction bestowed (on me) then would be no benefaction at all, and it would be impossible to get even from the simplest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>man what was due from him.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is the law of our religion that there should be no authority above</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>the authority of Jerusalem, for the Holy City is the place towards which all (Jews) turn in prayer, and God, may He be exalted, has ordained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the commands of the Head who will be in Jerusalem shall be obeyed and his leadership&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>followed, and that he who disobeys him, disobeys God. This is expressly stated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in their Torah. And just as the body cannot exist with two heads, so there is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no learning in a town with two rabbis. These synagogues of the Iraqis are attributed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to them, because they have the custom of keeping a second day after</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they keep with us a holiday. This was permitted to them by the Heads of Jerusalem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a special favor so that they could pray there on the day of their holiday, which is on the day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>following our holiday, which they keep together with us, but nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>else. The proof of the truth of what your servants have said is that in Palestine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are various places, in which there are synagogues of Iraqis, but these are solely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for prayer, and they have not in them a Judge or any other official. All they are allowed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to do is granted to them as a favor on the side of the Head who is in Jerusalem all the time, for they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>come to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage. This affair is a machination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the partisans of Joseph, who agitate for the leaders of Iraq. For they have connived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with him, that if he should succeed in getting your signature, approving him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a headship, this would strengthen them in what they intended to do for Joseph and his like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, our Lord &mdash; may God pray upon him and upon his pure (i. e. defunct) fathers &mdash; in his farsightedness will</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grant the request of his servants to repudiate those people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who try to split up what is bestowed upon your servant; for,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when he will get a partner in this benefaction, it will become a vexation. The pure excellencies (i. e. the defunct notables) have made grants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in many letters to many Heads in the course of time &mdash; the archives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>testify to this &mdash; but they have never given to anyone of them a partner, in what they bestowed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>upon them, for the letter of the Government &mdash; may God bestow glory upon its victories &mdash; is laid down ...&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A(nd the well-being of your) H(ighness) m(ay increase), n(ot) d(ecrease); and Peace!&nbsp;</p>
