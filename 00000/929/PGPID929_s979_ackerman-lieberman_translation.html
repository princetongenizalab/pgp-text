                        <ol><li>Record of testimony which was before us—we, the undersigned witnesses—on Friday</li><li>the ninth day of the month of Tishri of the year one thousand and three hundred and twenty-eight years</li><li>according to the count to which we are accustomed, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. Thus:</li><li>‘Ammār b. Joseph the Dyer said to us, “Be witnesses upon my behalf, and perform a qinyan from me, effective immediately, a complete qinyan,</li><li>write and sign using all the language of claims, and give it to Samuel ha-Kohen b.</li><li>Moses b. Ṣemaḥ, in order that he would have a title of right and proof  effective immediately, that I am acting</li><li>with the intent of my soul and (in accordance with) my desire, and I am not under duress nor compulsion, rather in accordance with my want and desire.</li><li>I have received from him everything which I had in partnership (shutafut) between the two of us,</li><li>and nothing whatsoever of mine remains with him—neither silver nor gold, not even the value of</li><li>a farthing; neither capital nor earnings—nothing whatsoever, whether called “property”</li><li>or not called “property”, whether real property or chattel, whether a deposit or an inheritance, </li><li>or whether from the funds we had in Malīj with (that is, invested with) ‘Amīr, Faraj, Khalaf, and ‘Aqūb, or whether with others—</li><li>whether Faraj b. Salīm or Iṣḥaq b. Dimashqiya—anything which we have with //any//one—</li><li>I have totally and completely withdrawn myself. This Samuel,</li><li>my former partner, retains the right to all these claims, for all that which I, ‘Ammār, had</li><li>in partnership (shutafut) with Samuel, or I had (deposited) in his possession, I have received and I have been paid in full to</li><li>completion, nullifying all secret dispositions and secret dispositions of secret dispositions, and secret dispositions which emer[ge from secret dispositions,]</li><li>to the end of all secret dispositions. Likewise, all secret dispositions and conditions which we have made and which have been made </li><li>on my behalf are null and void, neither proper nor enduring, using all the language</li><li>by which the Sages nullified secret dispositions and conditions. I have accepted responsibility for this document of renunciation</li><li>upon myself and upon my heirs after me, with the weight and force of all legal documents of admission and loan and documents</li><li>of renunciation which the Sages enacted and which are universally held, from this day forward, for (this document) is not like promises</li><li>and not like formularies. We performed a qinyan with this Mu‘amar and this Samuel concerning everything written</li><li>and stipulated above, with an item suitable for doing so. Everything hanging (between the lines): “Enduring”. Proper and enduring.</li><li>Jacob b. master Joseph of the Court (whose) s(oul is at) r(est)</li></ol>
