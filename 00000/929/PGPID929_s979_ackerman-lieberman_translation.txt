Recto
Record of testimony which was before us—we, the undersigned witnesses—on Fridaythe ninth day of the month of Tishri of the year one thousand and three hundred and twenty-eight yearsaccording to the count to which we are accustomed, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. Thus:‘Ammār b. Joseph the Dyer said to us, “Be witnesses upon my behalf, and perform a qinyan from me, effective immediately, a complete qinyan,write and sign using all the language of claims, and give it to Samuel ha-Kohen b.Moses b. Ṣemaḥ, in order that he would have a title of right and proof  effective immediately, that I am actingwith the intent of my soul and (in accordance with) my desire, and I am not under duress nor compulsion, rather in accordance with my want and desire.I have received from him everything which I had in partnership (shutafut) between the two of us,and nothing whatsoever of mine remains with him—neither silver nor gold, not even the value ofa farthing; neither capital nor earnings—nothing whatsoever, whether called “property”or not called “property”, whether real property or chattel, whether a deposit or an inheritance, or whether from the funds we had in Malīj with (that is, invested with) ‘Amīr, Faraj, Khalaf, and ‘Aqūb, or whether with others—whether Faraj b. Salīm or Iṣḥaq b. Dimashqiya—anything which we have with //any//one—I have totally and completely withdrawn myself. This Samuel,my former partner, retains the right to all these claims, for all that which I, ‘Ammār, hadin partnership (shutafut) with Samuel, or I had (deposited) in his possession, I have received and I have been paid in full tocompletion, nullifying all secret dispositions and secret dispositions of secret dispositions, and secret dispositions which emer[ge from secret dispositions,]to the end of all secret dispositions. Likewise, all secret dispositions and conditions which we have made and which have been made on my behalf are null and void, neither proper nor enduring, using all the languageby which the Sages nullified secret dispositions and conditions. I have accepted responsibility for this document of renunciationupon myself and upon my heirs after me, with the weight and force of all legal documents of admission and loan and documentsof renunciation which the Sages enacted and which are universally held, from this day forward, for (this document) is not like promisesand not like formularies. We performed a qinyan with this Mu‘amar and this Samuel concerning everything writtenand stipulated above, with an item suitable for doing so. Everything hanging (between the lines): “Enduring”. Proper and enduring.Jacob b. master Joseph of the Court (whose) s(oul is at) r(est)
