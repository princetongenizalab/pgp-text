        <p>S. D. Goitein, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/1453907">"Tyre-Tripoli-'Arqa: Geniza Documents from the Beginning of the Crusader Period,"</a> <em>Jewish Quarterly Review</em> 66, no. 2 (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1975), 69–88.</p>

<p>This is to inform the honorable elders that the bearer of this letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a prominent personality from ʾArqa who suffered great calamities and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>many misfortunes. His children and wife were taken captive and he lost everything he possessed, remaining "naked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and bare." "I went away full, and God has brought me back empty."&nbsp;He learned that his children</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>and wife were alive. He searched after them from one place to another, but found</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only one boy and the wife, while the others had been murdered. The captives are under</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the hand of a man who stood security for them until they would be ransomed. This man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was a benefactor to people, and now he travels seeking the mercy of God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the compassion of "the munificent from the people of the God of Abraham." They do all the time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>works of charity with him and deeds of lovingkindness. May God reward them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"For He is a God of recompense," He will requite. And "almsgiving saves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from death," etc.&nbsp;</p>
