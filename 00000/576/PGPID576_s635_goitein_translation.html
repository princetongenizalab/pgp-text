                        <ol>
<li>&nbsp;This is a copy of the engagement contract of Abū Manṣūr Ṣemaḥ., son of Rabbānā Japheth [known as] the elder</li>
<li>Abū ʿAlī, the perfumer, to Sitt al-Khāṣṣa, the daughter of the elder Abū ʾl-Barakāt Ibn al-Lebdī.</li>
<li>On Monday, the fifth day of the month of Kislev of the year 1458</li>
<li>&nbsp;of the era of the documents [November 11, 1146], in Fustāt, Egypt, which is situated on the Nile River and which is under the jurisdiction</li>
<li>&nbsp;of our lord Samuel, the great Nagid-may his name be forever, M. Ṣemaḥ, the young man, son of M.</li>
<li>and R. Japheth the elder, son of M. and R. Tiqvā, the elder, the Friend of the yeshiva-may he rest in Eden-concluded a match with Sitt al-Khāṣṣa, his fiancee,</li>
<li>a virgin, the daughter of M. and R. Berakhōt, the elder-may he rest in Eden. His obligation is a first instalment of 40</li>
<li>&nbsp;certified dinars, to be given as a gift at the time of the wedding, and a final instalment of 100 certified</li>
<li>&nbsp;dinars. Abū Manṣūr Ṣemaḥ, the fiance, presented the 40 dinars of the first instalment,</li>
<li>&nbsp;and the elder Abū ʾl-ʿAlā Musallam, the perfumer, son of Sahl, received them from him. The wedding is set for the month of</li>
<li>&nbsp;Kislev of the coming year-may we be destined for life in it-which is the year 1459. Ṣemaḥ assumed these obligations toward Sitt al-Khāṣṣa: She</li>
<li>will be regarded as trustworthy in all that concerns food and drink</li>
<li>in the house, no suspicion may be cast upon her, nor can he demand from her an oath concerning any of these</li>
<li>&nbsp;things, not even a supplementary oath. He may not marry another woman, nor retain</li>
<li>&nbsp;a maidservant whom she dislikes. Should he do any of these things, the final instalment is hers, and he must</li>
<li>&nbsp;release her [from the marriage bond by divorce]. In the case that there are no children, half of what remains of the dowry returns to her family. She may choose the place</li>
<li>and the domicile where she wishes to live. The rent of her properties is hers, she may spend it for whatever purpose she prefers;</li>
<li>&nbsp;he has no say in the matter. Should he nullify this engagement contract and not</li>
<li>marry her during the said Kislev, she will receive 20 dinars. This is a debt</li>
<li>and an obligation, binding [as from now]. We made the symbolic purchase from M. Ṣemaḥ, the young man, for Sitt al-Khāṣṣa, the fiancee,</li>
<li>according to all that is recorded above, a purchase which is definite and strict, made with the proper object for such a transaction.</li>
<li>We also made the symbolic purchase from Sitt al-Sāda, the daughter of the elder Abū Naṣr, the physician, the mother of Sitt</li>
<li>&nbsp;al-Khāṣṣa, the fiancee, in the most rigorous terms, binding as from now: Should her</li>
<li>daughter Sitt al-Khāṣṣa nullify the engagement contract and refuse to marry</li>
<li>&nbsp;the fiance during the said month of Kislev, she would owe the fiance</li>
<li>&nbsp;20 [dinars ... J This has taken place after the verification of her identity.</li>
