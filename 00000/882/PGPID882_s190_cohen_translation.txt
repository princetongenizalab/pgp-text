Recto

What shall I say to my beloved Kohen, the righteous and pure
R. Phineas. I send you this day a letter
of entreaty and supplication, for the sake of the Creator, who[se]
word you revere and fear, that you not delay me anymore.
We are on the road to the Land of Isra(el), and the only
thing that is delaying me is the balance of the pesiqa
that is in your honor's hands. From here on there should be no giving up.
Rather, have it collected today and tomorrow I shall depart
for there, in honor of you. Similarly, I sent a letter to his honor
my lord the Rav and Judge R. Ḥananel. For the sake of
the Creator, please do not keep me waiting another
minute beyond today, because
we are about to leave. Also speak to the collector
about a small pesiqa for my son today. Don't make
me delay till tomorrow to depart for there. Know that
your reward will be very great in this world and in the next.
I pray for your honor at all times, and may the O(mnipotent) save
you from every trouble and injustice and
reward your actions in th(is) wo(rld) and in the w(orld) to come and reward
you with sons who study Torah,
as, your beloved and admirer, who prays for
your honor, wish. David b. Benjamin, m(ay his) s(oul be) b(ound) in the (bundle of life). 

Verso, address
To his honor the pious Kohen R. Phineas
