<li>What shall I say to my beloved Kohen, the righteous and pure</li>
<li>R. Phineas. I send you this day a letter</li>
<li>of entreaty and supplication, for the sake of the Creator, who[se]</li>
<li>word you revere and fear, that you not delay me anymore.</li>
<li>We are on the road to the Land of Isra(el), and the only</li>
<li>thing that is delaying me is the balance of the pesiqa</li>
<li>that is in your honor's hands. From here on there should be no giving up.</li>
<li>Rather, have it collected today and tomorrow I shall depart</li>
<li>for there, in honor of you. Similarly, I sent a letter to his honor</li>
<li>my lord the Rav and Judge R. á¸¤ananel. For the sake of</li>
<li>the Creator, please do not keep me waiting another</li>
<li>minute beyond today, because</li>
<li>we are about to leave. Also speak to the collector</li>
<li>about a small pesiqa for my son today. Don't make</li>
<li>me delay till tomorrow to depart for there. Know that</li>
<li>your reward will be very great in this world and in the next.</li>
<li>I pray for your honor at all times, and may the O(mnipotent) save</li>
<li>you from every trouble and injustice and</li>
<li>reward your actions in th(is) wo(rld) and in the w(orld) to come and reward</li>
<li>you with sons who study Torah,</li>
<li>as, your beloved and admirer, who prays for</li>
<li>your honor, wish. David b. Benjamin, m(ay his) s(oul be) b(ound) in the (bundle of life).&nbsp;</li>
