                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In Your Name, Oh Merciful!.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not ask--my lord and master, the illustrious, noble benefactor&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the doyen of the House of David and the Sharif of the Jewish community&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the great prince, fortress, tower, Prince of the Diaspora&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of Israel; his h(onour), his g(reatness), his holiness) our master and l(ord) Solomon, may God exalt the throne&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of his rule and grant him his wishes and desires in eternity- -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-what happened to your servant (....) at the time when he arrived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;in this country, after he had been in danger from the Tatars&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three times. The last was that they arrived on the morning of the Fast,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when we were in al- ʿImrāniyya. They remained outside the town killing&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everybody who was on his way to or from the town, while we stayed in the synagogue waiting for what&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the enemy would do from hour to hour. Indeed, God had mercy upon us and they went away from us.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When night had fallen, we tried to get to the mountain, still without having eaten. However, we did not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>find the way. Thus we passed the night under the hedge of an orchard&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>right until morning, when we tried again to reach the mountain. However a s they came&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>between us and the mountain, we turned back to get to the farm; but saw on our&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>way fifty riders and when we tried another route, we saw on it&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about a hundred. I and those who were with me said the confession of sins, for we were sure&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be killed. However God put into my heart to cross over to hedge of&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raspberry- a thick one, and I took cover under it, I and the boy;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Tatars went by that hedge, twenty five&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>riders of them; had one of them stretched forth his whip, it would have reached&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>us. We remained there till noon, when they rode away from&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that vicinity and went up to the mountain, where we remained eight&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>days, eating the leaves of oak-trees and old bread. Finally&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we went down finding the country full of dead. When we arrived,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we learnt that in that night rumour spread that we had been killed.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But God helped, had m&egrave;rcy and saved us. However, the fact&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that I had not the privilege to see you was as though I was killed and that I&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arrived and did not find you. May God unite us as he has separated us.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
