the  Wise and Sage Teacher, of blessed memory, and (we recognize) his poverty and destitution. And since we admit his request we wrote
and signed for him, that he should have his poll tax given from the estate of the heqdēsh as all
former receivers do. Also that he receive bread from "the basket of the alms" together with all those who receive bread. Therefore we wrote
