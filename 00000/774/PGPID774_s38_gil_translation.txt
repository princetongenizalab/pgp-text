Recto


In Thy Name, oh Merciful: 


The undersigned whose testimony was recorded on this court record were present on the spot when the lawsuit was brought 


by Musāfir b. ʿAmrām against Saʿīd b. ʿAllūn, known as al-Qudsī regarding a tiara 


which Musāfir b. ʿAmrām said that he had sent with him to Tyre, but he (i.e. Saʿīd b. ʿAllūn) did not 


deliver it. For this reason there was a discussion among them, consisting in short of the following: 


Sa'id b. ʿAllūn al-Qudsī said that if he presented to Musāfir a letter coming 


to him from Tyre in which this tiara would be mentioned, he (i.e. Musāfir) would have to pay as qōdesh 10 


dinars to the poor of Jerusalem. He took an oath from him on this several times. Then Musāfir was presented with 


several letters from Tyre, and said that his oath referred to a letter from his father-in-law; 


so he was presented with a letter from his father-in-law; but(?) his oath had been that if he was presented with any letter 


whatsoever, from anybody in Tyre, he would have to pay as qōdesh 10 


dinars. So since Musāfir b. ʿAmrām requested them to write down their attestation 


of it, they attested and affixed their signatures beneath these deeds, on Sunday, 


(14-15) 28 Av, corresponding to the month Rabīʿ al-awwal of the year 442.
