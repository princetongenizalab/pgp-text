<p>In Thy Name, oh Merciful:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The undersigned whose testimony was recorded on this court record were present on the spot when the lawsuit was brought&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by Musāfir b. ʿAmrām against Saʿīd b. ʿAllūn, known as al-Qudsī regarding a tiara&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which Musāfir b. ʿAmrām said that he had sent with him to Tyre, but he (i.e. Saʿīd b. ʿAllūn) did not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deliver it. For this reason there was a discussion among them, consisting in short of the following:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sa'id b. ʿAllūn al-Qudsī said that if he presented to Musāfir a letter coming&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him from Tyre in which this tiara would be mentioned, he (i.e. Musāfir) would have to pay as qōdesh 10&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars to the poor of Jerusalem. He took an oath from him on this several times. Then Musāfir was presented with&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>several letters from Tyre, and said that his oath referred to a letter from his father-in-law;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so he was presented with a letter from his father-in-law; but(?) his oath had been that if he was presented with any letter&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whatsoever, from anybody in Tyre, he would have to pay as qōdesh 10&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinars. So since Musāfir b. ʿAmrām requested them to write down their attestation&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of it, they attested and affixed their signatures beneath these deeds, on Sunday,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(14-15) 28 Av, corresponding to the month Rabīʿ al-awwal of the year 442.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
