In Thy Name, oh Merciful! etc. 


 Here is what happened: There appeared before us al-Shaykh 


 Abūʾl-Surūr, our Master and Leader Peraḥyā, 


 the son of our Master and Leader Jacob, the parnās, 


 known as b. al-Fāsī, of blessed memory, and said 


 to us: I have a compound in the lane of 


 the synagogue which is known as "of the Babylonians" 


 that is adjacent to the place now known as


 the apartment of Simḥā al-ʿAkkāwī 


 al-Ḥaffār, 


 a part of which I have inherited from my mother 


 Sitt al-Bayt, the daughter of our Master David, 


 known as al-Dhahabī, of blessed memory, and its remaining part


 came into my possession from Abū Naṣr, 


 known as b. Khīṭ al-Barāda 


 Harūn b. Mubārak, of blessed memory,


 in a legal way, before a Muslim court, as attested 


 by the letters that I have with me. 


 As to the description of its boundaries, it is found in two Arabic letters 


 one of which 


 
recto, left column


 is on the name of my mother and the other one 


 on my name, (so that) there is no need to enumerate its boundaries 


 herewith. I have decided to 


 dedicate it so that its rent 


 be spent each month for 


 oil to burn in the two synagogues, 


 of the Babylonians and of the Palestinians,


may God preserve both of them forever, 


 in two equal parts,


after having deducted (the sum) needed for 


 its (i.e. the compound's) necessary improvement, 


 such as the repair of its 


damaged parts and so forth…
