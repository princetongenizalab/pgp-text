Recto
My lord and master and one to whom I am much indebted... 
I asked God for guidance and, relying on the nobility of your character, I am returning you the dinar, for it is not good. 
You will receive also 500 sheets of paper which were in my possession, and in the possession of the son of m(aster) Obadiah, who is ill at present, and which belong to the son of Obadiah. Take notice of this. 
There is nothing new with me except that I shall be on my way to you next week, if God, the exalted, so decrees. And complete peace upon my lord and great master and God's mercy! 
An excuse, please.
