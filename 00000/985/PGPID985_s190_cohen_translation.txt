Recto

This man was one of the notables of his community in his place, and he was rich.
The ruler of his land imposed a punishment upon him, so he fled from there
to Damascus. Then he left Damascus for the
land of Israel, but brigands attacked him, looting all (he had)
and injuring him. He is in p[a]in. When he reached the Holy
City, he said, "I shall go to Egypt where they will perhaps give me [s]omething
for the road so I can I return to my place." It is the haver's
habit, (may your) R(ock) p(rotect you), to be good to all who come to
Egypt, so may you be so with this man. Be his intercessor
and advocate and speak to our elders
in the holy community, those who are in the synagogue and those who
are at home. May the haver give him proper advice so that he may return
to his home. May the honored King reward you. May the haver inform
the community about the power of chari[t]y that is given to those who regularly stretch forth their hands,
all the more so to those who have f[allen] from their [w]ealth. I await the arrival
of your letter about what is being done for him and also about your situation
and every affair and every need (cf. Daniel 3:16). May your welfare increase, and regards
to all the admirers and benefactors, the e[lders] and the cantor and the entire
community [ ... 4]795 [1034-35].Â
