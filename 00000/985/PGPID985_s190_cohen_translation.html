<li>This man was one of the notables of his community in his place, and he was rich.</li>
<li>The ruler of his land imposed a punishment upon him, so he fled from there</li>
<li>to Damascus. Then he left Damascus for the</li>
<li>land of Israel, but brigands attacked him, looting all (he had)</li>
<li>and injuring him. He is in p[a]in. When he reached the Holy</li>
<li>City, he said, "I shall go to Egypt where they will perhaps give me [s]omething</li>
<li>for the road so I can I return to my place." It is the haver's</li>
<li>habit, (may your) R(ock) p(rotect you), to be good to all who come to</li>
<li>Egypt, so may you be so with this man. Be his intercessor</li>
<li>and advocate and speak to our elders</li>
<li>in the holy community, those who are in the synagogue and those who</li>
<li>are at home. May the haver give him proper advice so that he may return</li>
<li>to his home. May the honored King reward you. May the haver inform</li>
<li>the community about the power of chari[t]y that is given to those who regularly stretch forth their hands,</li>
<li>all the more so to those who have f[allen] from their [w]ealth. I await the arrival</li>
<li>of your letter about what is being done for him and also about your situation</li>
<li>and every affair and every need (cf. Daniel 3:16). May your welfare increase, and regards</li>
<li>to all the admirers and benefactors, the e[lders] and the cantor and the entire</li>
<li>community [ ... 4]795 [1034-35].&nbsp;</li>
