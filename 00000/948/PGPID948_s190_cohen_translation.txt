Recto
Your slave, the wife (= widow) 
of the cantor Ben Naḥman 
 
[I(n the name of the)] M(erciful) 
Your slave informs your excellency the Gaon, may your rule be established foreve[r], about her situation and that of her son, their hunger and nakedness. To date, [because of] these people, I have been banished for five months. We are perishing from the su[ffering] we have experienced. I am de[solat]e with no one to speak about [m[y case. A long time has passed and I wish that you would kindly look upon me with a merciful eye. Your slave's brothers are not able to show themselves in public on account of the poll tax. My husband did not pass away and forsake me without having me dwell in the house, sustaining myself and my son with whatever else comes from rental income. However, my husband's children and their aunt threw me out and forcibly took control of the place. The documents regarding the house were in my possession, and when the wall fell into disrepair and they needed to repair it, the deed to the house was taken from me. They have had it until the present. Since they took the documents from me they have been saying: "We owe you nothing. The house is ours, and you have no share in it." Your slave's belongings have been in the apartment since the day I left the house. My husband’s sister owes your slave five months’ rent and I have not collected from her.
It is very proper that you show favor to your slave and her son. May t(he) h(oly one) b(lessed be) H(e) double your reward and be your succor. May he grant you noble holidays like these. To you belongs the lofty decision in this matter. May your welfare and the welfare of your songs increase and not diminish. And so may it be his will.
