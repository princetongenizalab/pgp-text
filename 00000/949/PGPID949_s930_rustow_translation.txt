Rustow, Heresy, pp. 215-218, partial translation
5-12) You sought intercession before the caliph and the vizier, may they live eternally, in the matter of freeing the prisoners, may God bring them out into the light. We were hoping for their release from darkness and shadows and for their bonds to be sundered, but lo and behold, documents [ketavim] have come from Damascus [saying] that they are still in prison, although their chains and yokes have been removed. But their jailers are punishing them daily, and they are suffering. May the King of Glory send his word, heal them, and take them out into the light, and may [the government officials] come to see [the prisoners'] righteousness. [They had been offered release, on condition that they] swear by God and by the life of the caliph, may he live eternally, that they will never again be called by the title ḥaver and never serve the house of Israel in all of Palestine, in greater or lesser service, neither in law nor in any other matter. And [the brothers] responded, “We want to hear the words of this edict [ha-peteq ha-ze] from the mouth of its author and we will answer according to what…” [a small hole in the manuscript follows].
21-25) [The Fatimid government’s edict the Karaite’s set of demanding stipulations against the Rabbanites, about which he complains:] even our overlords [the caliph, vizier, and local governors?] would not make conditions for their slaves as [the Qaraites] have done. The essence of the conditions is that the ban not be proclaimed again on the Mount of Olives; that the Qaraites separate out for themselves one shop in the market of the Jews to slaughter and sell meat without [Rabbanite] inspection or supervision; that the rest of the butchers, if they have a pregnant ewe or cow, not sell it to one of the Jews [consumption of pregnant animals was prohibited under Qaraite law]; that if it is a holiday for [the Qaraites], the Rabbanites not come and try to desecrate it by opening their shops; that the rabbis not exercise authority over them; [and] that the imprisoned ḥaverim come neither to the Holy City nor to Ramla.
28) I have already compromised as much as I can. [above] I will not agree to even one of their conditions, nor will the ḥaverim.
29-31) Perhaps [the notables] will take letters for us to the government, may God defend it, in Ramla and Damascus, [asking] that they not force us to agree to this stipulation. And the letters that I have mentioned, and that our brothers have mentioned, do not seem disadvantageous. Time is short, for it is not hidden from you that the elders in Ramla and in Damascus… [a large lacuna interrupts the sentence]. We rely upon the Lord our God.
33-34) Because of my sins, I have become weak, and there is no strength left in me to write, nor to read that which I might ask to be written in my name.
