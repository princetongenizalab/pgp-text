                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>
<p>May God lengthen the life of my lord and master and preserve his well-being, happiness, safety, sufficiency and protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am writing from Alexandria on the twelfth day of the month of Av &mdash; may God visit upon you its blessing and the blessing of all the months that follow, and may it return</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for you for many years to come in which [we will witness] _the rebuilding of His temple, Amen_ &mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in a state of wellbeing and not lacking for anything &mdash; praise be to God, lord of the universe &mdash; to inform you that your letter arrived, and from it, I learned of your news and wellbeing and rejoiced very much at your (favorable) circumstances.&nbsp;You mentioned the matter of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the letter that Rabbi Moses left with Yūsuf al-Marjānī. I asked Yūsuf about it, and he said: "The only&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>letter in my possession is the one that Ibn al-Qāsh has written." So he said to me: "Take it," and I told him I would wait for your letter to arrive (with further details).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the moment, the only news we have from the West con&shy;cerns the barge (_qārib_) that arrived, may God bring us good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;news. As for the news of the bundle (rizma) that arrived labeled for Abū Saʿīd and his brother,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it was opened in the Dār Abū Rūḥ, and they found a qinṭār and 40 jarawī raṭls of wax inside. I was quite distressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by this, because it does not bode well for the people (literally: &ldquo;it is not a good beginning / omen for people&rdquo;). In the middle of it, there was bundle of silk (_khazz_) labeled for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord Abū Ṣḥaq Barhūn, your partner. The wax was removed from the bundle for Abū Isḥāq</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and it was repacked as it was. The elder Abū Ṣḥaq Ibrāhīm b. al-Iskandarānī then took possession of it. If a Nile boat (ushārī) arrives,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he (Ibn al-Iskandarānī) will see that the package is loaded onto it. Whatever goods arrive for you from the luggage, I will take delivery of them and send them on to my lord Abū Ṣḥaq Barhūn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The elder Abū l-Bishr Sulaymān is leaving tomorrow, travelling overland. I will send</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the shawls with him for you, as well as the _siddur_ (prayerbook). I have already delivered the letter to my lord the _ḥazzan_ (cantor) Shela.&nbsp;I had</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asked you to get 10 dīnārs for me from Abū Ṣḥaq with which to purchase a bale of flax for me. You did not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>men&shy;tion anything about this in your letter except to say that you would purchase a bale of flax for me. The letter that arrived&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for you (from the West?) with my lord Abū l-Bishr Sulaymān &mdash; I sent it to you with him. I am doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even more than you asked me to with [ ] respect to the olive oil, the soap and the other items.&nbsp;Let me know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the prices of _shesh_ (silk) in Fustat, and also the price of lasīn (a different kind of silk), because I have a few raṭls that I would like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to send. I was going to write to Abū Zikrī Elḥanān to tell him that I haven't seen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any letters from you, but then your letter to me arrived. I would like you to buy me two uqiyyas of [...].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should be of good quality. Then send it on. Also buy me a glazed, fired ceramic (vessel) and give it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Elḥanan. This has to be done, as I have (already) informed you.&nbsp;I spoke to Salāma and rebuked him for coming back (to Alexandria).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He said that when the ships arrive, he'll return to Fustat together with the olive oil, God willing.&nbsp;I send you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my very best regards. Also best regards to my lord Abū Ṣḥaq Barhūn. Tell him about the bales taken delivery of from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the barge (_qārib_) of Nuʿmān &mdash; 21 bales and 9 barqalos.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <p>1&ndash;10. My lord Abū Ṣḥaq Avraham b. al-Iskandarānī took delivery of 3 bales belonging to Yeshuʿa b. al-Makhmūrī.</p>
<p>11&ndash;15. The total comes to 24 bales and 9 barqalos.</p>
<p>16&ndash;22. I have stacked the 9 barqalos and some of the bales in the warehouse.</p>
<p>23&ndash;26. Some remains (unstacked), so I have placed them in the courtyard (_arṣa_).</p>
<p>27&ndash;30. I have taken a receipt (_ruqʿa_) for 21 bales and 9 barqalos.</p>
