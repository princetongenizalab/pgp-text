</li>
<li>
<p>(14-15) and guarded forever. May they not be changed. May they be maintained and not suppressed, set upright and not blackened. May God protect and shelter them, and succor them in His umbrage; attract them to His goodness and strengthen them against any evil. Reward them with His bounty, have mercy and pity. Thus He will do, since He is refuge&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;and strength. Receive great greetings from us, your loving and beloved brethren, the congregations that dwell in the city of Tyre,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;who tremble, are in fear, and sigh over the affliction of the low city, the renowned one. Who cry over its diseases and the might of its afflictions.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Since its straits have been multiplied and its calamities have came together. We supplicate and implore the mighty One, increase prayer and chanting, to relieve them, and to hasten&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;His pity for them. May He act this way, and withdraw wrath. It is manifest and known before God that we array benedictions for you often and in every assembly. We do not&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;withhold nor skip them amongst the benedictions for the congregations of the nation of God, our mighty One, may it increase and never wither. As to the contents of this our letter to you: There came to us His Honorable Great Holiness,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(21-22) our Master Joseph the son of our Master Abraham, of blessed memory, known as al-Sūmīsāṭī, and told us that he received letters from the notables of your community, may God preserve them, concerning a compound that is in the vicinity of your Great Synagogue, about which there occurred conflict and quarrel. Some people said that it was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;heqdēsh for the synagogue and that there was a man who withheld it from (the synagogue),saying that he bought it from its owner. There was an enormous conflict caused by this compound&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(24-25) among you. This compound is known as (the compound) of Hillā b. Joseph b. Hillā. It so happened that the owners of this compound, namely my Master Mevōrākh and my Master Mufarrij, the sons of our Master Joseph, of blessed memory, the son of our Master Hillā, were in our city of Tyre, that is (situated) on the shore of the Great Sea of the sunset, so we asked them&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>(26-27) about this aforesaid compound. So Mevōrākh and Mufarrij, namely the sons of Hillā b. Joseph b. Hillā, answered telling us: We truth- fully inform you that this compound, that belonged to our father, Hilla, in the city of Ṣōvā, is in the vicinity of the Great Synagogue; it is known&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;by the name of our father and his ancestors; it is a celebrated one, so that there is no need to mention the bordering properties. Our father dedicated its rent to the Great Synagogue.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;... and our father, of blessed memory, was gathered (to his people) while the compound was under his authority. He did not sell it to anybody in the world nor donate it as a gift. After his&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;death we remained its heirs, since there is no heir of our father except ourselves. We did not sell this compound nor appoint any proxy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;over it. Any man who comes claiming that our father sold it, or that we sold it, or that we appointed somebody as proxy to sell this compound, or&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;(if there comes) a man in our name, he bears false witness, speaks lies, his talk is empty, and nobody should give heed to what he says.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Any man who claims that he has a deed against our father or against us, let him set it forth, since we know that if a man sets forth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(34-35) such a deed against us it is forged, so the dishonor of who set it forth will be revealed. And Mevōrākh and Mufarrij, namely the sons of Hillā also answered before us: We dedicated the rent of the aforesaid compound to the Great Synagogue which is in Ṣōvā&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;..... and advanced the rent of this compound since the day it was held by the tenant&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;.......... and to save ... of the rent and to spend it on the needs of the Great Synagogue (to) which&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;we dedicated .... We do not need the money of this compound, but if, God forbid&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;.. we will sell, and (nobody) has this right, since it is on this condition that we dedicated its rent. So after we listened to the words&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;.... of the sons of Hillā and their judiciousness, we wrote and imprinted our deposition in this letter and sent it&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;to you, to appease quarrel among you, eliminate conflict, and withdraw discord. And may God from His dwelling make you dwell safely,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;abide in quietude, remove from among you any quarrel, conflict, dispute, and discord, and plant among you love, affection, amity,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;justice, and peace. And may He hasten, in your days, the gathering of His flock, the building of His Sanctuary, and the coming of His Anointed. Written on the first of the month of Marheshwan&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;in the first year of the shemiṭṭā,, the year 4789 of the creation. And then, greetings.&nbsp;</p>
