<p>.... and four hundred according to the era to which we are accustomed here in Fustat of Egypt which&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is situated on the Nile River. This happened to pass: There appeared in the Great Court before His Honorable and Great Sanctity, our Master and Leader, our Lord&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>David the Great Nāsī, the Head of the Diasporas of all Israel, the son of His Honorable and Great Sanctity, our Master and Leader, our Lord Daniel,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Great Nāsī, the head of the Yeshīvā Geʾōn Yaʿaqōv, may he rest in honor, Meshullām b. (empty space)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>known as Ibn Shurayq al-Dimashqī, and this is what he told us : Bear witness against me and transfer the ownership&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from me as from now on, using all expressions conveying titles of right; write, and sign, so that it be a right and an evidence,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that I made waqf of the compound, which I own in the city of Damascus, that is adjacent to the Great Synagogue to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.... I Meshullām b. (empty space), known as Ibn Shurayq, to the Great Synagogue and it is sold (to it). From now on it is&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>heqdēsh to the Great Synagogue. It belongs to it inclusive of all its belongings and boundaries, from the depth of the earth to the height of the sky and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its entrances and exits. I did not leave anything in it for myself, nor any of its rights,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor for my heirs after my passing away. Whoever might come, from the four directions of the world, son or daughter, brother or sister,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>near or far, a Jew or an Aramean, and contest what I have dedicated ....&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>above, his words will be void, and considered as a shard found on a street, that has no substance. And any deeds issued to oppose or to nullify this deed are void&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and will not be considered for a case in court. And I took the (transfer of) possession on myself&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which is not like securities, nor like formularies of deeds, but has the severity (and compulsion like any deed)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>made according to the statutes of our masters and that is usual among people. From this day and for ever, having nullified any (future) protests or conditions&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by any expressions stated by our masters as fit to nullify protests or conditions with. And we acquired from the said Meshullām&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everything that is written and specified above, by an instrument that is fit to serve for acquisition. Sound, firm,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and valid. And so we wrote and signed and handed over to whoever is entitled to it Damascus, so that it be held by them&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a right and an evidence; (the words) "any deeds issued (to assert) something or to nullify", that are written between the lines, are valid, and here is their validation;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;void&rdquo; that is written between the lines, is valid, and here is its validation.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
