He brought</li><li>the Elder Abū al-Faraj al-Bazzāz to us, who said, “I came to the shop</li><li>of this m(aster) Mōda‘, and the Head of the Congregations was there, and m(aster) Abraham al-‘Assāl was there,</li><li>and m(aster) Mōda‘ said to us, “Testify on my behalf concerning this Elder m(aster) Abraham</li><li>al-‘Assāl, that there is no longer a joint enterprise (mu‘āmala) between me and him, not in what //is his// alone nor</li><li>what is his wife’s.” The Head of the Congregations performed a qinyan with him concerning that in our presence</li><li>with an item suitable for doing so. We wrote and signed concerning</li><li>that which was before us, in order that there would be proof and a legal claim. That was in the middle ten-day period of</li><li>the month of Av of the year 1414 (of the Era) of Documents. Hanging between the lines: “w(hat) he posseses”.  They are</li><li>established and this is their confirmation: Isaac b. Samuel (may his) m(emory be) f(or a blessing)</li><li>Abraham b. Shemaiah the Ḥaver h(e shall) l(ive a) h(appy life,) a(nd his children shall) i(nherit the) l(and) great-grandson of Shemaiah Gaon (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>Japheth b. Abraham (may his) s(oul find) r(est)</li></ol>
