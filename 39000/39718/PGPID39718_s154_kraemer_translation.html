<li>In your name, O merciful one. Those who love your teaching enjoy well-being; </li>
<li>they encounter no adversity. </li>
<li>His eminent dignity — diadem of glory, our master </li>
<li>and teacher, light of our eyes, breath of our desire, crown of our head </li>
<li>and our glory, peerless in his generation, our lord Moses, the great rav, </li>
<li>the fortress and tower, sign and wonder of the time, </li>
<li>from East to West, son of the honorable, great and holy master and teacher of ours </li>
<li>Maimon, the great rav in lsrael, may he rest in paradise </li>
<li>— surely knows [the greatness] of my yearning for him, my delight in seeing him, </li>
<li>and my regret for not being near him. May God, the exalted, sustain all of </li>
<li>the communities through him, and crown them with glory in his lifetime. Amen. </li>
<li>I inform him, may God maintain his good fortune, of the vicissitudes that came over me </li>
<li>by way of calamities and illnesses, </li>
<li>which diverted me from corresponding with him. And as God put off the </li>
<li>appointed time, there came to mind the strophic poem having the melody, "Why continue concealing </li>
<li>when my secret is out," etc., which contains some of his </li>
<li>traits coinciding with my yearning and love for him. And following </li>
<li>its melody is the mukaffir Prayer of the Lights. </li>
<li>-20. God is my witness that only He and love for you will stir my spirit. </li>
