In your name, O merciful one. Those who love your teaching enjoy well-being; 
they encounter no adversity. 
His eminent dignity — diadem of glory, our master 
and teacher, light of our eyes, breath of our desire, crown of our head 
and our glory, peerless in his generation, our lord Moses, the great rav, 
the fortress and tower, sign and wonder of the time, 
from East to West, son of the honorable, great and holy master and teacher of ours 
Maimon, the great rav in lsrael, may he rest in paradise 
— surely knows [the greatness] of my yearning for him, my delight in seeing him, 
and my regret for not being near him. May God, the exalted, sustain all of 
the communities through him, and crown them with glory in his lifetime. Amen. 
I inform him, may God maintain his good fortune, of the vicissitudes that came over me 
by way of calamities and illnesses, 
which diverted me from corresponding with him. And as God put off the 
appointed time, there came to mind the strophic poem having the melody, "Why continue concealing 
when my secret is out," etc., which contains some of his 
traits coinciding with my yearning and love for him. And following 
its melody is the mukaffir Prayer of the Lights. 
-20. God is my witness that only He and love for you will stir my spirit.
