[In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.]
[God’s prayers, blessings, enduring benefactions and most perfect]
[greetings and salutations on our lord and master]
[the imām …, commander of the faithful, and upon his]


pure [fathers] and [most nobl]e so[ns, prayers enduring until the day of judgment.]


The slave kisses the ground and reports that he has in the village of [ ]


in the district of al-Bahnasā fifty date-palms and [ ]


in a partnership between him and a man known as Tabdūs/Tadrūs b. [ ]


the Christian date-palm grower. He asks and beseeches 


the issuing of a lofty decree, may God increase its n[obility and loftiness]      


to the mutawallī al-ḥarb (military commander) over the ?? of al-Bahnasā? and the fiscal supervisors (mushārifīn) and appointees (mustakhdamīn)


and the rest of the governors, deputies and officials (mutaṣarrafīn) protecting (him) and watching over (him)


and supporting him and preventing obstruction that would cause harm to the slave in this matter,


and supporting him and what is rightfully established for the slave 


as a benefaction for him and a favor to him.


To our lord, may God’s blessings be upon him, belongs the exalted opinion in this matter, God the exalted willing.

Praise be to God and his prayers upon our lord Muḥammad and his family.
God suffices for us; what a fine keeper is He.
