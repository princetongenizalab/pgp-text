<li>What do the master jurisprudents say, may God grant them success in what will please Him,</li>
<li>regarding a man who died and left a property amounting to 3.5 shares. His heirs were his two brothers,</li>
<li>who each received 1.75 shares and who each sold his respective share rather than take possession of them(?).</li>
<li>Some time after this, it came out that the original [deceased] brother had [already] sold one share out of the property that he [[left]] had, i.e.,</li>
<li>the 3.5 shares, and [in fact] he willed to each one [of the brothers] 1.25 qirats (= shares). Thus [each of the brothers] sold a half qirat more than he actually possessed.</li>
<li>Is the sale valid, and are they each obligated to [recover?] the half qirat from the buyer? [Or was] the sale [invalid]</li>
<li>from the beginning? If it was invalid, must the buyer pay the seller the [rent for the?]</li>
<li>years during which he lived in his possession, or not? Grant us a ruling, may God have mercy upon you.</li>
