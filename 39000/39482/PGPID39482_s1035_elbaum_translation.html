                        <p>What do the master jurisprudents say, may God grant them success in what will please Him, regarding a man who died and left a property amounting to 3.5 shares. His heirs were his two brothers, who each received 1.75 shares and who each sold his respective share rather than take possession of them(?). Some time after this, it came out that the original [deceased] brother had [already] sold one share out of the property that he [[left]] had, i.e., the 3.5 shares, and [in fact] he willed to each one [of the brothers] 1.25 qirats (= shares). Thus [each of the brothers] sold a half qirat more than he actually possessed. Is the sale valid, and are they each obligated to [recover?] the half qirat from the buyer? [Or was] the sale [invalid] from the beginning? If it was invalid, must the buyer pay the seller the [rent for the?] years during which he lived in his possession, or not? Grant us a ruling, may God have mercy upon you.</p>
