                        <ol>
<li>(Iftitāḥ: protokoll) In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;To our mistress, the noble lady, may God make her dominion eternal, secure her high rank, perpetuate her loftiness&nbsp;</li>
<li>and crush her enemies. In (return for) the bestowal of a benefaction and the rendering of a benefit&nbsp;</li>
<li>the beneficence of God, transcendence be to Him &ndash; may her thanks be disseminated for her and her reward stored up for her.&nbsp;</li>
<li>(Matn or baʾdiyya: expositio) Included in what is administered in her dīwān &ndash; may it continue to be filled with the perpetuity of her reign &ndash; is a communal mosque&nbsp;</li>
<li>with pious foundations from which twenty dīnārs are distributed annually to the person who preaches and upholds the lofty daʿwa.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Their remainder (i.e. of the income from the foundations) is distributed for the repair of the mosque and the salary of its superintendent and its mu&rsquo;adhdhin. And her slave&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;has a deputy charged with the office of preaching it (i.e. the daʿwa), known as Mūsā ibn Azhar. Recently he presented himself&nbsp;</li>
<li>and complained about the delay of the income for the office of preacher and about the strong desire of the tenants to defer it&nbsp;</li>
<li>and dissolve this foundation. And he mentioned that the debt owed by those living there until the end of Rajab in the year 415 is&nbsp;</li>
<li>about ten dīnārs. (Qiṣṣa or ruqʿa: petitio) Her slave asks for a benefaction in the form of a decree (manshūr) from her Presence,&nbsp;</li>
<li>may she be preserved, to the governor of the district and the administrator of its jurisdiction, strengthening the hand of the aforementioned (preacher)&nbsp;</li>
<li>in extracting (income) from these foundations according to what came before and what will resume, strengthening his affair, assisting him,&nbsp;</li>
<li>aiding him, and being solicitous towards him in everything that occurs regarding the repairs of the congregational mosque,&nbsp;</li>
<li>protecting its property and defending it, or in any occurrence of injury to this foundation, so that prayers for her may be abundant&nbsp;</li>
<li>during these days of (her) illustriousness. (Ḥukm or marsūm: dispositio) The exalted resolution in this matter belongs to her, if God wills.</li>
<li>(Khawātim: eschatokoll, including ḥamdala and taṣliya) Praise be to God and His prayers be upon Muḥammad the prophet and his pure family, and the sons of the Prophet&rsquo;s descendants, the rightly guided imāms, and save them.</li>
