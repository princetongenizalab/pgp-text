Which we must talk about [ ] this question [                    ]
The true meaning of their statement [ ] the law of the kingdom is the law (dina de-malkhuta dina) [    ] because we
saw that this inquirer had made this his prooftext and the foundations on which he built
his legal query and we will discuss the question itself afterwards. We say
that what we learned from the statements of the rabbis about this is rabbi Shemuʾel said:
The law of the kingdom is the law, etc.” Since we [already] clarified the meaning
of the saying the law of the kingdom is the law and we believe that it is sufficient
for the true people of knowledge, let us apply [this principle] 
to the question [that was presented to us]. We say that the matter of the partakers in the partnership (shirka) 
mentioned in this question necessarily follows one of the two following possibilities: either 
they made stipulations between them or they did not. (1) If they made 
stipulations between them, the money is counted accordingly without gain or loss, because  
the law follows rabbi Yehuda, who says “every stipulation that pertains to his money stands.” 
This saying is applicable to anyone whose partnership is sound because for any 
partnership that is not sound, the stipulations are also unsound. A sound partnership requires 
eight aspects. The first one is that the two partners should be of sound mind. 
The second is that two partners should be free. The third is that partners should have reached puberty.
The fourth is that the partners are free to dispose of their property. The fifth is that 
their respective share in the capital is known and clearly defined.
