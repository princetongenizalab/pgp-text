<li>Which we must talk about [ ] this question [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ]</li>
<li>The true meaning of their statement [ ] the law of the kingdom is the law (dina de-malkhuta dina) [&nbsp; &nbsp; ] because we</li>
<li>saw that this inquirer had made this his prooftext and the foundations on which he built</li>
<li>his legal query and we will discuss the question itself afterwards. We say</li>
<li>that what we learned from the statements of the rabbis about this is rabbi Shemu æel said:</li>
<li>The law of the kingdom is the law, etc.&rdquo; Since we [already] clarified the meaning</li>
<li>of the saying the law of the kingdom is the law and we believe that it is sufficient</li>
<li>for the true people of knowledge, let us apply [this principle]&nbsp;</li>
<li>to the question [that was presented to us]. We say that the matter of the partakers in the partnership (shirka)&nbsp;</li>
<li>mentioned in this question necessarily follows one of the two following possibilities: either&nbsp;</li>
<li>they made stipulations between them or they did not. (1) If they made&nbsp;</li>
<li>stipulations between them, the money is counted accordingly without gain or loss, because&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the law follows rabbi Yehuda, who says &ldquo;every stipulation that pertains to his money stands.&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
<li>This saying is applicable to anyone whose partnership is sound because for any&nbsp;</li>
<li>partnership that is not sound, the stipulations are also unsound. A sound partnership requires&nbsp;</li>
<li>eight aspects. The first one is that the two partners should be of sound mind.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The second is that two partners should be free. The third is that partners should have reached puberty.</li>
<li>The fourth is that the partners are free to dispose of their property. The fifth is that&nbsp;</li>
<li>their respective share in the capital is known and clearly defined.</li>
