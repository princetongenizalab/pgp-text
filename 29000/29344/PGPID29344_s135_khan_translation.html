<p>their leader and their scholars had suffered harm for two years the pure presence, may God make his rule eternal, charitably issued</p>

<li>
<p>a mighty decree, on account of which the harm done to them ceased, until a man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>called Nātān ibn Ibrāhīm arrived from the West, claiming the position of thehead of our Academy, who had been head of this Academy for sixteen years.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>but it turned out that he was preoccupied with his illness and his travels,4 andcaused the slaves to fear one another. The situation of the slaves has become desperate</p>

<p>of the government to open their synagogue and permit them to pursue their livesas is their custom and to restrain the hand of those who treat them overbearingly.</p>
