[In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.]  


Aḥmad [ … ] ibn al-Shaykh ʿAlī ibn al-Akhḍar acknowledged  


with a legal acknowledgement that he has received from al-Muzbid  


Abū al-Khayr, the physician, all the rent that he owed  


and that was recorded as owed by him in the lease that is in the possession of this Aḥmad.


This took place on the third of the month of Rabīʿ I of  


the year six-hundred and seven. I witnessed this for him  


It was written by ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Hārūn.
