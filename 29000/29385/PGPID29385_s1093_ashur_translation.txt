I, Joseph Rosh ha-Seder son of  Rabbi Jacob “the Head of the Rabbis’ House” wrote this Siddur of Rav [Saa]dya Gaon – may his memory be blessed –
[in Ca]iro in the month of Iyyar [1]512 (of the Era of Documents =1211 CE) for myself,
and in Iyyar 1[5…] in Cairo I found a siddur written in Saadya Gaon’s own hand,
and I’ve compared and proofread it letter by letter and word by word, and I’ve vocalized it.
May God make it a good sign upon me and upon all Israel. Amen
