                        <ol><li>On Thursday [ the t]wenty-fifth da[y] of the month of Tammuz in the year one thousand three</li><li>hundred and ninety-[fi]ve, according to the cou[nt] to which [we are accustomed], in Fusṭāṭ Egypt situated on the Nile</li><li>River, thus: M(r.) Yaḥyā b. M(r.) Samuel (who) r(ests in) E(den) [app]eared before us in the court, and sued M(r.) </li><li>Amram b. M(r.) Abraham (who) r(ests in) E(den) concerning … I have merchandise with him  which arrived …, </li><li>Siklatun clothing and silk; and a pierced piece of silver, and scammony, and saffron, and he bought for himself</li><li>with [its pro]ceeds merchandise in exchange: wool, spices and unspun linen, and cinnamon, and he accounted for </li><li>all this, and an account for fourteen and a quarter din(ars) remained with him. We asked this M(r.) </li><li>Amram concerning this and he said, “I did not take charge of anything he mentioned, rather I took</li><li>from him a quantity of silver coinage, and I sent it to Abū al-Ḥusayn al-Tinnīsī who assumed responsibility for its aforementioned</li><li>sale to M(r.) Japheth b. Abraham (who) r(ests in) E(den), and he prepared an account sheet concerning it. I calculated </li><li>its amounts for it, and I settled (accounts) with him, and [nothing] remains with him from that residual.” This M(r.) Yaḥyā asked</li><li>if he would delay the case, since this M(r.) Amram is traveling, and there was a power of attorney between them for the sum total</li><li>in their account, and they asked him if he would delay his case till the return of this M(r.) Amram from his journey</li><li>so that the claim for this M(r.) Yaḥyā will take priority when the Sage sits (and evaluates the case) and this M(r.) Amram agreed to this,</li><li>and at that the two of them took leave. We wrote down and signed what happened before us in order that it would be a title of right and proof.</li><li>Scratched out: the two of them took leave. And it is correct and this is its confirmation.     Hillel the Ḥazzan b. ‘Alī (may his) m(emory be) f(or a blessing)</li><li>‘Alī ha-Kohen b. Yaḥyā (whose) s(oul is at) r(est)</li><li>Yair b. Ephraim (whose) s(oul is at) r(est)</li><li>Peraḥya b. Natan …</li></ol>
