                        <p>The slave kisses the ground, paying obedience to God the ex(alted), before the seat of our lord the nagid, may your glory be exal[t]ed and your honor be increased and may (God) grant your sons long life, bless them, protect them, and see that they acquire great prestige. Amen. I inform you that the elder Abuʾl-ʿIzz b. ʿImrān, (may his R(ock) p(rotect him), owes me money. Your slave knows that he has nothing and that he is poor. The truth is that your slave was having quires of the Torah copied for him, but the person who was copying them left for Palestine (Shām). Your slave heard that the most illustrious elder Abuʾl-ʿIzz, (may his) R(ock) p(rotect hlm), has a good manuscript hand, so your slave asks our lord, may your glory be exalted, to order him to [c]opy at least two quires per week (he doesn't stipulate how many weeks), that is, if he confirms that he owes me. If he can only give a little, I shall drop the claim, though I shall not drop my hope for the mercy of God the ex(alted). It amounts to about sixty dirhems. Let him copy for me until he discharges what he owes. When he discharges it, I will forgive the advanced payment for his copying before he copied anything. This favor I ask from God the ex(alted) and from our lord, may your glory be exalted. May Go[d] bring redemption during the lifetime of our lord. Everything in our lives comes from God and from our lord. May God ma[k]e you ever the refuge for those seeking [r]efuge [...] in His mercy and make you [...] in His presence with all. And peace.</p>
