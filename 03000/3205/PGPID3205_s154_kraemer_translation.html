<li>I wish to inform the esteemed haver, may God preserve him,&nbsp;</li>
<li>that the letters which he wrote to me&nbsp;</li>
<li>and what pertains to them have arrived by means of the elder&nbsp;</li>
<li>Barakāt b. lsmāʿil al-Bazzāz, may he rest in paradise.&nbsp;</li>
<li>They report what happened to his brother,&nbsp;</li>
<li>may he rest in paradise, who was killed, as the One who is righteous&nbsp;</li>
<li>in all His ways determined. (The deceased) left his brothers as his heirs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>(Barakāt) mentioned to me that his brother had left goods&nbsp;</li>
<li>with certain men with whom he had business dealings.</li>
<li>Do your utmost to summon the litigants</li>
<li>and to caution and intimidate them&nbsp;</li>
<li>in the name of God, may He be honored and extolled, so that they confess&nbsp;</li>
<li>in the absence of clear evidence. And mediate&nbsp;</li>
<li>among them; perhaps you can settle the issues&nbsp;</li>
<li>by compromise. If the litigants are unresponsive,&nbsp;</li>
<li>then any(one)of them who does own up to the partnership should swear&nbsp;</li>
<li>an oath of partners. And whoever equivocates and refuses to&nbsp;</li>
<li>acknowledge a partnership, in the absence of clear evidence against him,&nbsp;</li>
<li>should have a ban pronounced in his hearing.</li>
<li>May his welfare increase!</li>
