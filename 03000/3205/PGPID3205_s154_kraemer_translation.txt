I wish to inform the esteemed haver, may God preserve him, 
that the letters which he wrote to me 
and what pertains to them have arrived by means of the elder 
Barakāt b. lsmāʿil al-Bazzāz, may he rest in paradise. 
They report what happened to his brother, 
may he rest in paradise, who was killed, as the One who is righteous 
in all His ways determined. (The deceased) left his brothers as his heirs. 
(Barakāt) mentioned to me that his brother had left goods 
with certain men with whom he had business dealings.
Do your utmost to summon the litigants
and to caution and intimidate them 
in the name of God, may He be honored and extolled, so that they confess 
in the absence of clear evidence. And mediate 
among them; perhaps you can settle the issues 
by compromise. If the litigants are unresponsive, 
then any(one)of them who does own up to the partnership should swear 
an oath of partners. And whoever equivocates and refuses to 
acknowledge a partnership, in the absence of clear evidence against him, 
should have a ban pronounced in his hearing.
May his welfare increase!
