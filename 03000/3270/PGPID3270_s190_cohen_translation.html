                        <p>Your slave woman, the wife // widow //,</p>
<p>destitute and debt-ridden&nbsp;</p>
<p>with four orphans&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the name of "Him who looks after the poor and broken-spirited" (Isaiah 66:2). I have made God the ex(alted) my intercessor with your excellencies, my masters, the illustrious lordly judges, and with the elders of Israel, may their Rock [bless them] with the best of blessings, so that [you kindly bestow] upon me something to conceal myself and the fo[ur] who are with me, and with which I can satisfy my hunger and theirs. We are five souls, desolate, naked, and starving, having no one to turn to except God the ex(alted) and my masters the illustrious elders,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"who sow by all waters" (Isaiah 32:20), who act with kindness toward all. I and my children never, ever uncover our faces, not to a group of people or to individuals. However, necessity has now forced us to do this. May you look upon us with a merciful eye and obtain reward because of us. May you not neglect us. After this petition the only thing left is life through your kindness or death as a result of your neglect, far be it from you. May God the ex(alted) accept from us our pious prayers for you. May your welfare increase for ever.&nbsp;</p>
