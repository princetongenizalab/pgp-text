                        <p>We the undersigned witnesses on this wr[it] state that we know the situation of Sulaymān b. Ḥasan, and that he is poor, with few possessions. We do not know if he possesses any real estate or cash. He owes Baqā ha-Levi b. Ṣāliḥ three and a half dinars, which the latter has claimed from him in a Muslim court. He is not able to pay the fee for the police guard. So they threw him into prison. He has asked us, the undersigned, to report what we know about his situation. This was on the same Monday the eighteenth of Sivan 1486 (June 9, 1175) in the city of Minyat Ziftā, so that it be a conveyance of right and a proof.</p>
