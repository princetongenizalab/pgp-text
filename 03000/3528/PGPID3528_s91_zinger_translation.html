                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>The testimony of what took place before us, we the undersigned witnesses:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Ghalib the cantor known as Abū Manṣūr b. Mr. Ḥalfon, the seller of olive oil, m(ay he rest in) E(den), quarrelled&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with his sister from his father and mother, Bārra ('innocent') bt. Mr. Halfon the seller of olive oil, m(ay he rest in) E(den), regarding a house&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that Bārra alleged that her father designated as inheritance for her to the exclusion of her brother, Mr. Ghālib. However,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no right was confirmed to her about the house over which they quarrelled except the upper floor&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of \\the small// house when she previously pre- sented the court with \\a deed// in the hand of our Lord David,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the great nasi, the nasi of all Israel, son of our lord and prince Hezekiah, the head of all the diasporas&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of Israel, may they rest in honour, indicating that Mr. Ḥalfon, her father, gave her the upper floor&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the small house. She (also) presented the court with a deed written&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Muslim courts indicating that her father gave her as a dowry the entire aforementioned house,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but (the document) was not confirmed that day, thus her brother said: "This deed is forged,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and no right is confirmed to her by this deed neither in Jewish nor Muslim courts."&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disputes and arguments took place between them and the matter reached the point that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she brought him before a Muslim court. She was deemed deserving of a ban by the (Jewish) court for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her transgression of bringing her brother to Muslim courts and abandoning the living&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(16 - 18) laws of God. Just when she was about to be placed under the ban, the elder Abū &lsquo;Alī Mr. Yefet the elder the glory of the congregation b. Mr. Abraham the elder, m(ay he rest in) E(den), was nominated from among peace-loving righteous elders (to reach a compromise between them). He asked the court (or: the judge) to grant her a delay (from the ban) until he could convene her&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with her brother in his home and mediate between them. Therefore, we the undersigned entered&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the house of the aforementioned elder Abū 'Alī. Mr. Ghālib and his sister were present.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aforementioned elder spoke to them [at length] and reproached Bārra, saying:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Only the upper floor is confirmed to you by the Hebrew deed, and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Muslim [deed] does not confirm to you anything." She responded deceivingly: &ldquo;No! My father gave me&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this house and it is mine!" The aforementioned elder Abū &lsquo;Alī said to her:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;And the other house, the large one, which is adjacent to this house, do you have&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>something with which you claim your father gave it to you also?" She said: "No, I do not have&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any right over the other house at all and no pretext." We spoke gently with her&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to take what God made for her lawful and abstain from demanding what is not hers&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by right, but she refused and did not accept (this). We wrote down what took place before us, signed it,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and gave it to Mr. Ghālib the cantor so it will be evidence and testimony. This was&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a long time ago and when&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
