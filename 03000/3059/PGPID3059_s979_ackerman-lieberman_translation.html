Joseph forbidding either of them from marrying, and when</li><li>she demanded this testimony of us, we established it in the month of Sivan 1460</li><li>(of the Era) of Documents, and it was written as a title of right. Judah b. Solomon the Scribe (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>Solomon ha-Levi b. Samuel (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>These witnesses signed in our presence:</li><li>Ḥiyya b. Isaac (who) r(ests in) E(den)   Ephraim b. Meshullam (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>The Glory of the Negidut, may he be lifted up appeared. His representatives kiss his hand and inform</li><li>his Glory, may God protect his Excellency, about the appearance of the witnesses, and their signing</li><li>before us, (attesting) to everything above. After that, we took precautions:</li><li>and we performed a qinyan from Tamīm the groom, a complete qinyan, that he had in his possession ten dina(rs)</li><li>which would become a complete obligation upon him for the (maintenance of) the poor of Fusṭāṭ if it were revealed that there existed some impediment concerning the marriage.</li><li>We explained this so that you could express your opinion in the matter. And peace.</li><li>Ḥiyya b. Isaac (who) r(ests in) E(den)   Ephraim b. Meshullam (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li></ol>
