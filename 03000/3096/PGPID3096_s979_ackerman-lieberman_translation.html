(our) teacher and our master</li><li>[…] … the beloved student, the pious, (who) r(ests in) E(den), in order that he would have proof, that we—in accordance with the intention</li><li>of our souls—[…] this (person) as a partner with us in the sugar-factory. And we, all three of us, have agreed</li><li>to be equal in terms of profit and loss; thus, if there is profit, it will be divided into three and [for each]</li><li>one of the thr[ee of us, a th]ird, and if there is a loss, likewise, it will be divided into th[ree, and each]</li><li>one of the three of us will take a third  […] the Elder Mufaḍḍal fifty gold Fusṭāṭ dinars,</li><li>to his Elder, the Elder Abū al-[…], to be deposited in his hand …</li><li>[...] … [...] … the owners …who sell the raw sugar to us.

The three of them agreed</li><li>to be partners in the profit and loss all the days of the partnership in the factory. We performed a qinyan [with]</li><li>the three of them, with an item suitable for doing so, orally, effective immediately, nullifying all secret dispositions</li><li>and conditions, according to what we heard from their mouths, in a partnership which they stipulated between them</li><li>in the year … according to the old system. And there is one blank space preceding filled in with dots. This is their confirm[ation.]</li><li>Everything is trustworthy and clear, proper and enduring.</li><li>Jehiel b. master Eliakim the A[leppan]</li></ol>
