                        <p>On Sunday, 27th of Sivan 1470 [1159 CE], His Honor, Greatness, and Holiness, the young man, Nathan [&hellip;], the esteemed elder son of His Honor, Greatness,&nbsp; and Holiness [&hellip;] Hakohen, the esteemed elder, concluded a match with Sitt al Baha, daughter of His Honor, Greatness, and Holiness, our teacher and master Abraham the cantor, the elder, may he rest in Eden. And they both agreed that&nbsp; the mohar will be forty gold dinars, of which he shall pay her in advance [&hellip;] ten&nbsp; gold dinars [&hellip;] from the day of marriage, which is set to take place on Elul. And there will remain incumbent on her thirty gold dinars, good, excellent. And he undertook upon himself that Sitt al- Baha, the fianc&eacute;e, will be regarded by him as&nbsp; trustworthy in the conduct of her household in all matters concerning food and&nbsp; drink and claims, and that he will not keep a slave girl disliked by her. &nbsp;And if he will do any of the above, he has to pay her late installment and divorce her, if she&nbsp; chooses to do so. And she will live [&hellip;] in a Jewish neighborhood [&hellip;]. And we&nbsp; performed a qinyan between His Honor, Greatness, and Holiness the esteemed&nbsp; elder, son of [&hellip;] Hakohen, and the esteemed elder [father of &hellip; Sitt] al- Bahā, the&nbsp; aforementioned fianc&eacute;e, on the above-mentioned stipulations. Strong, firm and&nbsp; valid [&hellip;] son of Yeshuʿa, may he rest in the garden of Eden.&nbsp;</p>
