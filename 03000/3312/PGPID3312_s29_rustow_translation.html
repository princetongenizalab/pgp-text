<li>His servant,</li>
<li>Sedaqa b. Tāmār&mdash;</li>
<li>in your name, O merciful one&mdash;</li>
<li>who seeks refuge in God and in his excellency our lord, may God establish</li>
<li>his glory, multiply his loftiness and smite his enemy.</li>
<li>His situation is not hidden from him, and the poverty he is experiencing,</li>
<li>as well as the abundance of dependents and debts demanded</li>
<li>from him by evil creditors. He had</li>
<li>a partnership with Abū l-Ḥasan b. al-Tadmurī and Sayyid al-Ahl</li>
<li>b. al-Jashū in a ḍamān for the release-tax (munfalit) of the Fayyūm. Perhaps</li>
<li>he is aware of this and it is not hidden from him. His servant</li>
<li>had drawn up a deed of acknowledgment between himself and them so that his name would be</li>
<li>with them, among the Jews, without having his name in</li>
<li>the dīwān. He agreed to this, trusting them and thinking</li>
<li>well of them. But when trouble came to the door, they discarded him,</li>
<li>turned away from him, suppressed him and disregarded his situation,</li>
<li>while he kept pursuing them, believing they would show remorse</li>
<li>and probity. During this period, they promised him that</li>
<li>they would provide [him] with sustenance for him and his family and</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>would settle the matter with the creditors and pay off</li>
<li>some of his debt. Then they arranged with him that he should remain quiet</li>
<li>and refrain from (pursuing) them. When they obtained great</li>
<li>benefaction and succeeded in what they acquired, they threw off</li>
<li>his servant. Some of the creditors have become forceful toward him,</li>
<li>and imprisonment has struck him for four</li>
<li>days, while he is sick with eye inflammation, his family is perishing</li>
<li>and all of them are in a very bad condition. Heaven forfend that</li>
<li>during his rule&nbsp;there should be someone as oppressed as his servant.</li>
<li>Abū l-Maʿālī b. Khawajak knows what has taken place</li>
<li>between his servant and them. He asks for his favor</li>
<li>in summoning him and hearing what he has to say,</li>
<li>and in arranging to release his servant from prison</li>
<li>before the Sabbath. His resolution is successful, if God wills.</li>
