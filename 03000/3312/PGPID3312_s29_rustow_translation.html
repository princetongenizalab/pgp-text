<li>His/her servant,</li>
<li>Sedaqa b. Tāmār&mdash;</li>
<li>in your name, O merciful one&mdash;</li>
<li>who seeks refuge in God and in his excellency, our lord, may God establish</li>
<li>his glory, multiply his loftiness and smite his enemy.</li>
<li>His situation is not hidden from him, and the poverty he is experiencing,</li>
<li>as well as the abundance of dependents and debts demanded</li>
<li>from him by evil creditors. He had</li>
<li>a partnership with Abū l-Ḥasan b. al-Tadmurī and Sayyid al-Ahl</li>
<li>b. al-Jashū in a ḍamān for the release-tax (munfalit) of the Fayyūm, and perhaps</li>
<li>he is aware of this and it is not hidden from him. His servant</li>
<li>had drawn up a deed of acknowledgment between himself and them so that his name would be</li>
<li>with them, among the Jews, without having his name in</li>
<li>the dīwān. He agreed to this, trusting them and with thinking</li>
<li>well of them. But when trouble came to the door, they discarded him,</li>
<li>turned away from him, suppressed him and disregarded his situation</li>
<li>while he kept pursuing them, believing they would show remorse</li>
<li>and probity. During this period, they promised him that</li>
<li>they would provide [him] with sustenance for him and his family and</li>
</ol>

<li>and would settle his matter with the creditors and pay off</li>
<li>some of the debt, then they arranged with him that he should be quiet</li>
<li>and refrain from pursuing them. When they obtained great</li>
<li>fortune and succeeded in what they acquired, they abandoned</li>
<li>her servant, and some of the creditors</li>
<li>have become forceful against him, and imprisonment has struck him for four</li>
<li>days while he is sick with eye inflammation and his family is perishing</li>
<li>and all are in the worst condition, and I fear that there would be</li>
<li>in her days someone oppressed like her servant</li>
<li>And Abu al-Ma'ali ibn Khawajak knows what is</li>
<li>between her servant and them, and he asks for her favor</li>
<li>that she summon him to her and hear what he has to say</li>
<li>and arrange for getting her servant out of prison</li>
<li>before Saturday, and her opinion is successful, God willing</li>
