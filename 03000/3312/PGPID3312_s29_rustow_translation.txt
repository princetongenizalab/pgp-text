Recto

His/her servant,
Sedaqa b. Tāmār—
in your name, O merciful one—
who seeks refuge in God and in his excellency, our lord, may God establish
his glory, multiply his loftiness and smite his enemy.
His situation is not hidden from him, and the poverty he is experiencing,
as well as the abundance of dependents and debts demanded
from him by evil creditors. He had
a partnership with Abū l-Ḥasan b. al-Tadmurī and Sayyid al-Ahl
b. al-Jashū in a ḍamān for the release-tax (munfalit) of the Fayyūm, and perhaps
he is aware of this and it is not hidden from him. His servant
had drawn up a deed of acknowledgment between himself and them so that his name would be
with them, among the Jews, without having his name in
the dīwān. He agreed to this, trusting them and with thinking
well of them. But when trouble came to the door, they discarded him,
turned away from him, suppressed him and disregarded his situation
while he kept pursuing them, believing they would show remorse
and probity. During this period, they promised him that
they would provide [him] with sustenance for him and his family and

Verso
and would settle his matter with the creditors and pay off
some of the debt, then they arranged with him that he should be quiet
and refrain from pursuing them. When they obtained great
fortune and succeeded in what they acquired, they abandoned
her servant, and some of the creditors
have become forceful against him, and imprisonment has struck him for four
days while he is sick with eye inflammation and his family is perishing
and all are in the worst condition, and I fear that there would be
in her days someone oppressed like her servant
And Abu al-Ma'ali ibn Khawajak knows what is
between her servant and them, and he asks for her favor
that she summon him to her and hear what he has to say
and arrange for getting her servant out of prison
before Saturday, and her opinion is successful, God willing
