Recto

His servant,
Sedaqa b. Tāmār—
in your name, O merciful one—
who seeks refuge in God and in his excellency our lord, may God establish
his glory, multiply his loftiness and smite his enemy.
His situation is not hidden from him, and the poverty he is experiencing,
as well as the abundance of dependents and debts demanded
from him by evil creditors. He had
a partnership with Abū l-Ḥasan b. al-Tadmurī and Sayyid al-Ahl
b. al-Jashū in a ḍamān for the release-tax (munfalit) of the Fayyūm. Perhaps
he is aware of this and it is not hidden from him. His servant
had drawn up a deed of acknowledgment between himself and them so that his name would be
with them, among the Jews, without having his name in
the dīwān. He agreed to this, trusting them and thinking
well of them. But when trouble came to the door, they discarded him,
turned away from him, suppressed him and disregarded his situation,
while he kept pursuing them, believing they would show remorse
and probity. During this period, they promised him that
they would provide [him] with sustenance for him and his family and

would settle the matter with the creditors and pay off
some of his debt. Then they arranged with him that he should remain quiet
and refrain from (pursuing) them. When they obtained great
benefaction and succeeded in what they acquired, they threw off
his servant. Some of the creditors have become forceful toward him,
and imprisonment has struck him for four
days, while he is sick with eye inflammation, his family is perishing
and all of them are in a very bad condition. Heaven forfend that
during his rule there should be someone as oppressed as his servant.
Abū l-Maʿālī b. Khawajak knows what has taken place
between his servant and them. He asks for his favor
in summoning him and hearing what he has to say,
and in arranging to release his servant from prison
before the Sabbath. His resolution is successful, if God wills.
