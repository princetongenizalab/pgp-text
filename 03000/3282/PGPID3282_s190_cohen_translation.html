                        <p>Your slave woman who is alone</p>
<p>desolate, and destitute&nbsp;</p>
<p>the daughter of Rāfiʿ the silk worker&nbsp;</p>
<p>(or: silk merchant)</p>
<p></p>
<p>In (your) name, O Mer(ciful)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am writing this petition with my blood and tears, seeking aid from God // be pra(ised) // and your excellency my master, the most illustrious head, the great Nagid, the noble lord, may God perpetuate your leadership over Israel, make constant (Divine) favor and your happiness, protect you and take care of you, and destroy your enemies and those who envy you. I am distressed, impoverished, alone, enduring va[riou]s kinds of suffering and especially "nakedness." I have no outer garment to conceal me, nor anything to cover my head. I sent you a petition before this one about the same thing, but you did not favor me with anything. You know, may God perpetuate your greatness, that I and people like me have nothing but the mercy of God the ex(alted) and your mercy. To whom shall I apply if not to you and to whom shall I turn. I ask you (margin:) not to turn me away disappointed by your lack of favor. If you will be so kind, appoint someone to take up a collection for me so that I can buy a veil to cove[r] my head during the upcoming holiday, may God bless you and allow you to celebrate it for many years to come. Accept from me my pious prayers and earn abundant recompense. To you belongs the lofty decision. And peace and praise be to illustrious God.</p>
