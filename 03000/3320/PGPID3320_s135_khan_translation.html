<p>small [children] and that the head of the police [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their father and their mother. He did not leave money [</p>

<p>in it. He left them a small house, in which they might settle [</p>

<p>from the factory. It was also surrounded and [ ]</p>

<p>He did not work in a government office for one day. He was a tradesman []</p>

<p>He had a brother who was a clerk in the government office known [as] an&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>abjectly poor man. The slaves have in their possession .... between him [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his death. On his death they were registered with the aforementioned qāḍī al-qu[ḍāh] ]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Makārim. There was animosity between him and 'Abū Zikrī, the companion of [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and he wanted to do him harm. At that time he drew up documents relating to the payment of a debt in his name that had no&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>validity, as he had done for many other people..... Out of fear of punishment&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he wrote a promissory note for six-hundred dInars. He sold all the personal belongings of&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>his wife and received gifts from his brother and others until he raised four-hundred dīnārs.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When &rsquo;Abū Zikrī died the penalty for the debt was rescinded, since the government officials&nbsp;</p>

<p>in this just time knew that it was an injustice. He wanted &nbsp;them to return</p>

<li>
<p>to him what he had paid out, but his death forestalled him. His brother remained alive after him for a time without anything</p>

<p>being demanded from him. The justice of these glorious days will prevent injustice being done to</p>

<p>the slaves and their being required to pay something for which they are not liable. They humbly request</p>

<p>an investigation into their case, so that they may be treated in a just and impartial manner</p>

<p>and they may be granted equality with other people who enjoy justice</p>

<p>and mercy. They further request the issuing of a gracious rescript, with the motto of al-&lsquo;Ādil at its head,</p>

<p>(commanding) [[the investigation of]] their release and the restoration of their rights, in order that they may thereby live</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a new life, and let it be made known in the lands and the urban settlements, as a just act for them and their right.]</p>
