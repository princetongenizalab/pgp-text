<p>small [children] and that the head of the police [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their father and their mother. He did not leave money [</p>

<li>
<p>in it. He left them a small house, in which they might settle [</p>

<p>from the factory. It was also surrounded and [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did not work in a government office for one day. He was a tradesman []</p>

<p>He had a brother who was a clerk in the government office known [as] an&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>abjectly poor man. The slaves have in their possession .... between him [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his death. On his death they were registered with the aforementioned qāḍī al-qu[ḍāh] ]&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Makārim. There was animosity between him and 'Abū Zikrī, the companion of [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and he wanted to do him harm. At that time he drew up documents relating to the payment of a debt in his name that had no&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>validity, as he had done for many other people..... Out of fear of punishment&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he wrote a promissory note for six-hundred dInars. He sold all the personal belongings of&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his wife and received gifts from his brother and others until he raised four-hundred dīnārs.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When &rsquo;Abū Zikrī died the penalty for the debt was rescinded, since the government officials&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in this just time knew that it was an injustice. He wanted &nbsp;them to return</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him what he had paid out, but his death forestalled him. His brother remained alive after him for a time without anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>being demanded from him. The justice of these glorious days will prevent injustice being done to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the slaves and their being required to pay something for which they are not liable. They humbly request</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an investigation into their case, so that they may be treated in a just and impartial manner</p>

<p>and they may be granted equality with other people who enjoy justice</p>

<p>and mercy. They further request the issuing of a gracious rescript, with the motto of al-&lsquo;Ādil at its head,</p>
</li>

<p>(commanding) [[the investigation of]] their release and the restoration of their rights, in order that they may thereby live</p>

<p>a new life, and let it be made known in the lands and the urban settlements, as a just act for them and their right.]</p>

<li>
<p>[ ] The heirs of &rsquo;Abū al-Faḍā&rsquo;il</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] son of Baqā&rsquo;, the Jewish merchant,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] died on the seventeenth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of &Scaron;a&lsquo;bān, in the year five-hundred and forty-five.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He left as his heirs three daughters, a servant ... and a wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slaves were not aware of anything until</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the head of the police in Fusṭāṭ came to their home together with two witnesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and they registered all the possessions of the father of the slaves and sealed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>them. They did not leave anything for the slaves worth a single dirham</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>without sealing it, neither in his place of residence nor in the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>factory. The slaves did not know the reason for this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>since their father was a merchant who had dealings with merchants</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and merchants' representatives. He was well known in this capacity. He had no&nbsp;dealings with government offices,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not even for one day, nor did he undertake to farm taxes for them. The justice&nbsp;of these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>glorious days, which has filled the wide lands,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will prevent injustice being done to the slaves. They humbly request</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the issuing of the exalted command, may God increase its efficacy, _</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in a gracious rescript, headed by the motto of al-&lsquo;Ādil, to release them, to restore&nbsp;their father's property to them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to remove any obstruction (regarding their rights) to the residential property</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the factory, to grant them power to recover</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what is owed to them from every one who is in debt to their father,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or other dues, and to prevent anyone removing their rights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and being able to have access to their father's property, so that they may thereby&nbsp;live</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a new life, and let it be made known in the lands and the urban settlements,</p>
