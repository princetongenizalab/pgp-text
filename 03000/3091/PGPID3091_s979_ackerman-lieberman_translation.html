                        <ol><li>[…req]uirement of respons[ibility…]</li><li>[…] the profit and loss in halves, exactly, and from […]     </li><li>a non-interest-bearing loan with the […] he will reckon it, and as for that which was not established, his statement will be (trusted) as two proper trustworthy witnesses.</li><li>I took these conditions upon myself for him in accordance with my wish [… and] I [wrote] this document for him, in order that it would be in his hand and the hand of his heirs after him, upon me and upon my heirs after me</li><li>well-ordered, proper, enduring, and durable, according to which they will be successful in their plea before any court, no[t] like formularies or like prototypes of documents, rather as the most certain and most perfect of that which was outlined by our Sages,</li><li>(may their) m(emory be) f(or a blessing), in the like, and all my correspondence in any script or language which would exclude something or invalidate this document, be it hereby nullified effective immediately before you and considered like a potsherd (thrown) in the marketplace</li><li>which is without substance, and for every court which would rely upon it (as a legal source), they may not rule from them, and I have nullified all secret dispositions and conditions and secret dispositions concerning secret dispositions and secret dispositions that may develop from </li><li>secret dispositions forevermore which may be made for me and which we have made concerning this document as established by the Sages. We performed a qinyan with (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Manasseh ha-Kohen b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Saadiah the Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>and with h(is honor our) tea(cher) and m(aster) this Joseph the trustworthy Parnas b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Solomon the Elder, (who) r(ests in) E(den), al-Qudsī, with an item suitable for doing so, concerning all that which is written and explained above, and </li><li>we wrote and signed this testimony and gave it to (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) this Joseph the Parnas, in order that he would have in his hand a title of right and proof, and thus the Elder Abū al-Ḥasan (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) this Manasseh ha-Kohen b. (our) t(eacher) and m(aster) </li><li>Saadiah ha-Kohen (who) r(ests in) E(den) said to us, “Between me and (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Joseph the trustworthy Parnas there was a partnership (shirka) for this amount, in a document recorded as to term and date prior to the date of this document,</li><li>and he said to me that it has been lost and he did not have it. And if it reappeared, it would be considered void, since the condition(s) between us therein had already lapsed.” Then we, the undersigned witnesses, asked (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) this Joseph the trustworthy</li><li>Parnas concerning that, and he said, “Yes. The loss did indeed happen.” And he confirmed that the condition(s) between the two of them therein had already lapsed, and that [no] claim remained for him therein. We, the witnesses, performed a qinyan with (our) tea(cher) and m(aster)</li><li>this Joseph the trustworthy Parnas, a complete and effective qinyan, with an item suitable for doing so, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions, which he has nullified effective immediately. Neither he (that is, his testimony) nor any written record </li><li>that may be presented (concerning the relationship) between him and between this M(r.) Manasseh ha-Kohen will be given or accepted other than this one written now with this date recorded above. We wrote and signed this testimony</li><li>in order that there would be a title of right and proof, during the middle ten-day period of the month of Iyyar in the aforementioned year, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt. Everything is proper and clear and enduring.</li><li>Written on an erasure: “nass”: All is established and this is their confirmation.</li></ol>
