Recto

In (Your) name, O Mer(ciful). "The name of the Lord is a tower of strength to which the righteous man runs and is safe" (Proverbs 18:10). 
"The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom and his tongue speaks," etc. (Psalm 37:30). 
" But the lowly shall inherit the land, and delight in abundant we(ll-being)" (Psalm37:11).
I inform your precious excellency, his honor, greatness and holiness, (ou)r maste(r) and teache(r)
Obadaiah the wise and discerning, the scholar, son of his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher
Benayahu the elder, the precious, the benefactor and generous one, "the Crown of the Elders," may his Rock protect him
and be his succor, that the bearer of these lines is his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher
Maṣliaḥ the honored elder, the scholar, the wise and the discerning, son of our
master and teacher Jacob the honored elder (who) r(ests in) E(den). He is modest and ashamed,
having fallen from his wealth and having formerly been a doer of charitable deeds and kindness. Fate ("Time") snared him
in its net and forced him to resort to human beings. He came to Fustat
trusting in your kindness, for he had heard the reputation of the beneficent elder, your father.
When he comes to you, do with him as is in keeping with your good habit and your upright
nature, per chance t(he) h(oly one) b(lessed be) H(e) will provide for him through your good hands, "for good things
are brought about through the agency of good men." What you do should be done discreetly
and swiftly, because he must be on shipboard for Passover.
May the Lord of Hosts double your reward and be your succor and cover you with the cover of
His wings and save you from every enemy and adversary. Accept greetings of
drops of water, first from Him who dwells on high and then from your slave Nethanel
b. Ḥalfon, who asks after your welfare and prays for your great prosperity,
that God make it permanent, Selah.
