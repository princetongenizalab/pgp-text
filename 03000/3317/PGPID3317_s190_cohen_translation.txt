Recto

In (Your) name, O Mer(ciful). "The name of the Lord is a tower of strength to which the righteous man runs and is safe" (Proverbs 18:10). 
"The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom and his tongue speaks," etc. (Psalm 37:30). 
" But the lowly shall inherit the land, and delight in abundant we(ll-being)" (Psalm37:11).
I inform your precious excellency, his honor, greatness and holiness, (ou)r maste(r) and teache(r)
Obadaiah the wise and discerning, the scholar, son of his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher
Benayahu the elder, the precious, the benefactor and generous one, "the Crown of the Elders," may his Rock protect him
and be his succor, that the bearer of these lines is his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher
Maṣliaḥ the honored elder, the scholar, the wise and the discerning, son of our
master and teacher Jacob the honored elder (who) r(ests in) E(den). He is modest and ashamed,
having fallen from his wealth and having formerly been a doer of charitable deeds and kindness. Fate ("Time") snared him
in its net and forced him to resort to human beings. He came to Fustat
trusting in your kindness, for he had heard the reputation of the beneficent elder, your father.
When he comes to you, do with him as is in keeping with your good habit and your upright
nature, per chance t(he) h(oly one) b(lessed be) H(e) will provide for him through your good hands, "for good things
are brought about through the agency of good men." What you do should be done discreetly
and swiftly, because he must be on shipboard for Passover.
May the Lord of Hosts double your reward and be your succor and cover you with the cover of
His wings and save you from every enemy and adversary. Accept greetings of
drops of water, first from Him who dwells on high and then from your slave Nethanel
b. Ḥalfon, who asks after your welfare and prays for your great prosperity,
that God make it permanent, Selah.

I inform your honor my honored and pre[ci]ous lord, "the Crown of the El[ders"],
the benefactor and generous one, "the Glory among Men," "the Diadem of the Speakers," may God protect you
"and cover you in the cover of [His] tent and raise you high upon a rock" (Psalms 27:5) our master and teacher Maym[ū]n
of the good name, whose reputation is renowned throughout the world and whose fragrance carries farther
than all the powders of the merchants like clean myrrh. May God save you from the judgment of de[ath]
and from its decrees and snares. I inform my lord that were it not for your good reputation and worthy [...]
would not have come to Fustat. I hope that you, my lord, will not [abandon me]
and that God, in His mercy, will not forget me. I also wish that your honor would [ask]
your friends who are like you, per chance God will make [t]h[em]
have pity on me and they will help me. For I am in need and pressed [...]
from His full hand. May He never put you in need of gifts from human beings. [I pray ]
to the Creator and to you, for I want to go on my way home in peace tomorrow or the day after, 
because I want to be on shi[pboard] for Passover.
I cannot lift my voice or my head because of the shame. [I] come not [as a w]arner
but as one who reminds. May God protect your flowers, O my lord and [...],
our master and teacher Jacob the wise, the discerning, the benefactor and g[enerous one, "the Diadem]
of the Speakers," him and his brothers; may their Rock protect them and save them from all bad
[de]crees, and may He pass on to them your merit and good deeds, [and p]eace.
Also, I ask my lord to arrange for me the get (divorce document). May I be able to merit
to see your countenance. Peace. I wish for it to be done dis[creetly]
and not in public.
