                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In (Your) name, O Mer(ciful). "The name of the Lord is a tower of strength to which the righteous man runs and is safe" (Proverbs 18:10).&nbsp;</li>
<li>"The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom and his tongue speaks," etc. (Psalm 37:30).&nbsp;</li>
<li>" But the lowly shall inherit the land, and delight in abundant we(ll-being)" (Psalm37:11).</li>
<li>I inform your precious excellency, his honor, greatness and holiness, (ou)r maste(r) and teache(r)</li>
<li>Obadaiah the wise and discerning, the scholar, son of his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher</li>
<li>Benayahu the elder, the precious, the benefactor and generous one, "the Crown of the Elders," may his Rock protect him</li>
<li>and be his succor, that the bearer of these lines is his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher</li>
<li>Maṣliaḥ the honored elder, the scholar, the wise and the discerning, son of our</li>
<li>master and teacher Jacob the honored elder (who) r(ests in) E(den). He is modest and ashamed,</li>
<li>having fallen from his wealth and having formerly been a doer of charitable deeds and kindness. Fate ("Time") snared him</li>
<li>in its net and forced him to resort to human beings. He came to Fustat</li>
<li>trusting in your kindness, for he had heard the reputation of the beneficent elder, your father.</li>
<li>When he comes to you, do with him as is in keeping with your good habit and your upright</li>
<li>nature, per chance t(he) h(oly one) b(lessed be) H(e) will provide for him through your good hands, "for good things</li>
<li>are brought about through the agency of good men." What you do should be done discreetly</li>
<li>and swiftly, because he must be on shipboard for Passover.</li>
<li>May the Lord of Hosts double your reward and be your succor and cover you with the cover of</li>
<li>His wings and save you from every enemy and adversary. Accept greetings of</li>
<li>drops of water, first from Him who dwells on high and then from your slave Nethanel</li>
<li>b. Ḥalfon, who asks after your welfare and prays for your great prosperity,</li>
<li>that God make it permanent, Selah.</li>

                        <ol>
<li>I inform your honor my honored and pre[ci]ous lord, "the Crown of the El[ders"],</li>
<li>the benefactor and generous one, "the Glory among Men," "the Diadem of the Speakers," may God protect you</li>
<li>"and cover you in the cover of [His] tent and raise you high upon a rock" (Psalms 27:5) our master and teacher Maym[ū]n</li>
<li>of the good name, whose reputation is renowned throughout the world and whose fragrance carries farther</li>
<li>than all the powders of the merchants like clean myrrh. May God save you from the judgment of de[ath]</li>
<li>and from its decrees and snares. I inform my lord that were it not for your good reputation and worthy [...]</li>
<li>would not have come to Fustat. I hope that you, my lord, will not [abandon me]</li>
<li>and that God, in His mercy, will not forget me. I also wish that your honor would [ask]</li>
<li>your friends who are like you, per chance God will make [t]h[em]</li>
<li>have pity on me and they will help me. For I am in need and pressed [...]</li>
<li>from His full hand. May He never put you in need of gifts from human beings. [I pray ]</li>
<li>to the Creator and to you, for I want to go on my way home in peace tomorrow or the day after,&nbsp;</li>
<li>because I want to be on shi[pboard] for Passover.</li>
<li>I cannot lift my voice or my head because of the shame. [I] come not [as a w]arner</li>
<li>but as one who reminds. May God protect your flowers, O my lord and [...],</li>
<li>our master and teacher Jacob the wise, the discerning, the benefactor and g[enerous one, "the Diadem]</li>
<li>of the Speakers," him and his brothers; may their Rock protect them and save them from all bad</li>
<li>[de]crees, and may He pass on to them your merit and good deeds, [and p]eace.</li>
<li>Also, I ask my lord to arrange for me the get (divorce document). May I be able to merit</li>
<li>to see your countenance. Peace. I wish for it to be done dis[creetly]</li>
<li>and not in public.&nbsp;</li>
