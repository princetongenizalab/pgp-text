                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In (Your) name, O Mer(ciful). "The name of the Lord is a tower of strength to which the righteous man runs and is safe" (Proverbs 18:10).&nbsp;</li>
<li>"The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom and his tongue speaks," etc. (Psalm 37:30).&nbsp;</li>
<li>" But the lowly shall inherit the land, and delight in abundant we(ll-being)" (Psalm37:11).</li>
<li>I inform your precious excellency, his honor, greatness and holiness, (ou)r maste(r) and teache(r)</li>
<li>Obadaiah the wise and discerning, the scholar, son of his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher</li>
<li>Benayahu the elder, the precious, the benefactor and generous one, "the Crown of the Elders," may his Rock protect him</li>
<li>and be his succor, that the bearer of these lines is his honor, greatness and holiness our master and teacher</li>
<li>Maṣliaḥ the honored elder, the scholar, the wise and the discerning, son of our</li>
<li>master and teacher Jacob the honored elder (who) r(ests in) E(den). He is modest and ashamed,</li>
<li>having fallen from his wealth and having formerly been a doer of charitable deeds and kindness. Fate ("Time") snared him</li>
<li>in its net and forced him to resort to human beings. He came to Fustat</li>
<li>trusting in your kindness, for he had heard the reputation of the beneficent elder, your father.</li>
<li>When he comes to you, do with him as is in keeping with your good habit and your upright</li>
<li>nature, per chance t(he) h(oly one) b(lessed be) H(e) will provide for him through your good hands, "for good things</li>
<li>are brought about through the agency of good men." What you do should be done discreetly</li>
<li>and swiftly, because he must be on shipboard for Passover.</li>
<li>May the Lord of Hosts double your reward and be your succor and cover you with the cover of</li>
<li>His wings and save you from every enemy and adversary. Accept greetings of</li>
<li>drops of water, first from Him who dwells on high and then from your slave Nethanel</li>
<li>b. Ḥalfon, who asks after your welfare and prays for your great prosperity,</li>
<li>that God make it permanent, Selah.</li>
