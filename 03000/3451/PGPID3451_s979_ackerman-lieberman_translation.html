That which the [exalted] C[reator] facilitates [in terms of]</li><li>profit after returning the capital, and after paying for all the [necessary] provisions […]</li><li>and a shop and other (things) typical in this industr[y … eleven]</li><li>qīrāṭs for the Elder, this Abū al-Barakāt, from the profit … […]</li><li>for the Elder, this Abū al-Faraj, eleven qīrāṭs therefrom […]</li><li>in the profit and the two additional qīrāṭs as remuneration for [his trouble and work, and if,]</li><li>God forbid, there is the opposite of a profit, it will be divided in equal halves between the two of them […]</li><li>We called the Elder Abū al-Faraj to testify to a loan of all that which this [Abū]</li><li>al-Barakāt […] which is the capital in this partnership (shirka) and that amount is fifty [dinars …]</li><li>also that which he specified therein, and its total being [a single] dirham, coming into his hand, and the acceptance of all […]</li><li>to him in this partnership (shirka), and approval of that which was decided therein for the profit […]</li><li>… he also established … remuneration for his trouble and work, and if he has no attachment … […] this [Abū al-]</li><li>Barakāt therein, since he has the right of disposal therein, without (the approval of Abū al-Barakāt), and the requirement of [trans-]</li><li>acting, all of it was in his hand. We called the Elder th[is] Abū al-Barakāt to testify […]</li><li>as to what was decided concerning the profit and its opposite concerning those two qīrāṭs of prof[it…]</li><li>this […] remuneration for his trouble and work, his surplus over him beyond that which they divided […]</li><li>We performed a qinyan with each of them and his fellow concerning that which is ascribable to him, respectively, in t[his partnership (shirka) …]</li><li>That which is specified in this document, a complete and effective qinyan, with an item suitable [for doing so,] </li><li>nullifying all the secret dispositions and conditions, with neither duress nor force nor compulsion, with neither negligence [nor error, with neither illness]</li><li>nor disease among the two of them, nor any of the like from all the factors which invalidate testimony, and without any sort of duress at all. This testim[ony]</li><li>we wrote and signed in two copies, letter by letter and word by word, and we gave each of them one</li><li>copy, in order that he would have a title of right and proof obligating his fellow. In their whole transaction, if someone cancels</li><li>this partnership (shirka) before the end of the period fixed above, he will be obligated (to pay) his fellow </li><li>fifty dinars as a complete gift, effective immediately. The two of them will be obligated in all these stipulations, and they were satisfied with it.</li><li>We performed a qinyan with each of them likewise, with the most certain stipulations of acquisitions. That was in the month of S[ivan] dated above.</li><li>There is an erasure upon “in the profit” and upon “the two qīrāṭs”. Everything is proper and clear and enduring. Our signatures were dela[yed]</li><li>until Av : Nathan ha-Kohen b. Solomon ha-Kohen (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>Yeshu‘a b.
