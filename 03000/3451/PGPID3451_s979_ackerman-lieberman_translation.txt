This testim[ony]we wrote and signed in two copies, letter by letter and word by word, and we gave each of them onecopy, in order that he would have a title of right and proof obligating his fellow. In their whole transaction, if someone cancelsthis partnership (shirka) before the end of the period fixed above, he will be obligated (to pay) his fellow fifty dinars as a complete gift, effective immediately. The two of them will be obligated in all these stipulations, and they were satisfied with it.We performed a qinyan with each of them likewise, with the most certain stipulations of acquisitions. That was in the month of S[ivan] dated above.There is an erasure upon “in the profit” and upon “the two qīrāṭs”. Everything is proper and clear and enduring.
