(1-2) His H(onor), Mr. Sar Shalom, may the Rock [preserve him] b. his H(onor), Mr. Yeshuʿa m(ay he rest in) E(den), asked us, the witness undersigned [in this document,] to enter into his house, in the presence of his wife, [Si]tt al-[...] 

 

bt. his H(onor), G(reatness and) H(oliness) Mr. Abraham, the beloved of the Yeshiva, m(ay he rest in) E(den). Her brother was present and identified her. 


Then, she told us: “Make the symbolic purchase from me and bear witness for me, as of now, cancelling any notifications and conditions, 


according to my will, while not being coerced, that I have released, I mean released, my husband, the aforementioned Sar Shalom 


(6-7) b. Mr. Yeshuʿa, from fifty dinars of good and high quality of the seventy dinars he prescribed as a debt owed by him for my delayed marriage gift written in his ketubba. 

 

I do not leave for myself anything except only twenty dinars. I also have relinquished [in addition to that] 


the trustworthiness that he had bestowed on me in my ketubba. I have released him from all 


this and have released him a complete release orally and in (my) heart, in this world and in the next. 


We, the witnesses, have made the symbolic purchase from her, a complete and rigorous purchase with an instrument fitting for purchase 


on everything written and explicated above. This was in the last tenth of the month of 


Nissan year 1437AG (15-25 April 1126). True and Established.
