(My) help comes) f(rom the) L(ord, who) m(ade) h(eaven) and earth) Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord (is to be praised).” 
To my beloved, prosperous, and blessed mother, may God, the ex(alted), make her prosper, prolong her life, and make her honored posi- tion permanent. May he never let me be absent from her service, and soon, note late, unite me with her and with my prosperous and beloved brothers Faraj Allah and Rashid, may God make them prosper and encompass them with his mercy and solicitude. 
I bring herewith respectfully to your knowledge that I am well and in good health thanks to the solicitude of the God of the spirits and healer of all flesh. I am yearning, dear mother, very very much to see you. I heard that you were ill and was very much upset and sad about this. 
I intended to come and serve you, but was unable to do so because of the high price of the rent of a mount and the other expenses and difficulties of the travel. Moreover, I had sore eyes. Today, however, thanks to his name, I am well and happy and have a good life, thanks to the allmighty God who bears all, supports the falling, and helps the poor. God the creator… and sustainer, is my witness that I was deeply distressed when I learned about your illness, being unable to help. But the Judge of the widows and Father of the orphans will restore your health, for he wounds and binds up, etc. God, the ex(alted), for the sake of the sanctification of his name in his world, will preserve you and protect us by your presence, you, the unifier of our dispersed family, you, the crown of my head. 
Four months ago I entered my house. But be quiet, dear mother, all you have asked for me in your prayers has come true, for she is a virtuous and pious woman, "very fair to look upon, a virgin w(hom no) m(an) h(ad) k(nown).”  She does not lack any of your noble, fine, beautiful, and excellent character-traits. She yearns for your respected pres- ence and is distressed about your illness. May God, the ex(alted), unite us soon while you are in good spirits and health. And I request from you the favor and charity that you bestow upon me your prayers day and night, as you have been accustomed to do for me.
