                        <ol><li>Testimony which was given before us, we [the witnesses who have signed our hands below at the end of] this [document.]</li><li>Thus: M(r.) Joseph b. Sam[uel …] appeared before us in court, [testifying before you to the soundness]</li><li>of his mind and body and the freedom of his will, will[ingly, under neither duress nor force nor compulsion, with neither negligence]</li><li>nor error, with neither illness nor disease, nor any of the like ]from all the factors which invalidate testimony.]</li><li>He said to us: “Testify concerning me and perform a qinyan with me from [now on, write and sign on my behalf using all the] appropriate legal [formulae]</li><li>and the expressions of certainty, and all the lang[u]age of claims, [… and gave i]t</li><li>to his honor, his h(oliness, our) te(acher) and ma(ster) Manasseh ha-Dayyan b. Phineas (who) r(ests in) E(den), in order that he would have in his hand proof and a legal claim [from now] on</li><li>that I have no claim to anything which he has, nor anything in his possession, nor anything to which he can lay claim, nor a demand of any sort,</li><li>nor a legal claim of any sort, neither dinar nor dirham, neither gold nor silver, neither smithed </li><li>nor raw, neither anklets nor black clothing, neither clothing nor cloth, neither appliance nor instrument,</li><li>neither equipment nor material, neither merchandise nor goods, neither a partnership (shirka) nor a joint investment (khulṭa), neither deposit</li><li>nor pledge, neither loan nor commenda, neither rental nor lease, neither wages nor deposit,</li><li>neither dispatch nor directive, neither loan nor responsibility, neither account nor remainder of account nor error</li><li>in accounting, nor anything under all the Heavens which one could possess and by which one could become wealthy, whether real estate</li><li>or movable property. I have released him from all legal claims and demands, a complete, cumulative,</li><li>irreversible, unconditional release, without interpretation diminishing it; a release clear </li><li>as to its inner intent. I have also released him from all types of oaths, both grave and simple, from Torahitic</li><li>oaths and oaths instituted by the Sages as well as rider oaths, and even ḥerem [setam.] I have [re]leased him </li><li>completely, both with oral testament and in (my) heart, in this world and in the world to come. Any demand which I may demand or legal claim which I will make</li><li>upon him or anything I will dispute after my writing of this release, will be untrue and false and n[ull]</li><li>and one may not turn to them, nor judge based upon them, as I have no right of any sort before him at all, </li><li>nor any sort of legal claim, nor any sort of demand. I wrote him this release</li><li>in order that he would have proof against me in my lifetime and against my heirs after my death, for him in his lifetime and for his heirs</li><li>after his death. I have taken upon myself and upon my heirs after my death everything mentioned in this release</li><li>with the most perfect and wisest (means) which our Sages (may their) m(emory be) f(or a blessing) have fixed in writing releases, along with nullifying all </li><li>secret dispositions and conditions, as (this document) is not like promises and not like formularies but rather (bears) the weight and force of all legal documents</li><li>[of those attentive to and] careful in the court. We performed a qinyan with M(r.) Joseph b. Samuel (who) r(ests in) E(den) and his honor, his holiness, (our) t(eacher) and m(aster) Manasseh the Judge</li><li>b. m(aster) Phineas, (who) r(ests in) E(den), concerning everything written and explained above, with an item suitable for doing so. Proper and enduring.</li><li>We wrote and signed on Wednesday, the twenty-first day of the month of Sivan, in the four thousand</li><li>eight hundred and forty-fifth year since the creation, in the city of Alexandria, situated on the shore of the Great Sea.</li><li>“a third of it” (is) written on an erasure. Proper and enduring.     Mawhūb the Ḥazzan b. Aaron the Ḥazzan (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>Ezra b. Aaron m(ay his) s(oul find rest)     Mevaser b. … Shela the Mumḥ[e] (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>Amram b. ma(ster) Mevaser (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li></ol>
