<p>What does our lord- may his splendour be exalted and his honour increase- say concerning&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;a woman whose husband, a Kohen, has travelled, once, twice,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and three times. She didn't know the times of his travelling. He&nbsp; didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;leave her anything to eat or drink.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;She then swore by oaths that would make the mountains tremble that she&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would not remain with him after this time. Whenever anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>speaks to her to reconcile with him, she renews her oaths that&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she won't stay with him.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
