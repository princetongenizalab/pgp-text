What does our lord- may his splendour be exalted and his honour increase- say concerning 


 a woman whose husband, a Kohen, has travelled, once, twice,  


and three times. She didn't know the times of his travelling. He  didn't  


 leave her anything to eat or drink.  


 She then swore by oaths that would make the mountains tremble that she  


would not remain with him after this time. Whenever anyone  


speaks to her to reconcile with him, she renews her oaths that  


she won't stay with him.
