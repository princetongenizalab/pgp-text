In your name, O merciful.
I am writing to you my lord, the most illustrious elder —
may God prolong the life of your excellency and make permanent your honored position, affluence, highness, eminence and power,
and humiliate your enemies and all who envy you — to inform you that if I tried to
describe only a fraction of the troubles, tribulations and humiliations that I have endured in
this world, the account would be too long; no letter could contain them
and no epistle do them justice. In addition to the troubles
that I previously had to bear, I was overtaken by the disaster caused by the Monk. I fled
to Lukk, and this was most unfortunate: had I gone to the countryside or to
Upper Egypt, I would have fared better. A man stronger
than me would have weakened on this journey. But this is what God willed. When leaving [Alexandria], I had
ten dīnārs with me. For twenty-five days I was traveling. Then I was overtaken by
the Feast of Passover. During the eight months that I spent in Lukk, bad news continued to come from home.
At the end of the [Jewish] month of Elul [August–September], I went to Barqa for the High Holidays and
the Fast. Then, when I learned of the death of the one whose bones will be ground in hell [the Monk],
I returned to Lukk to join other travelers going to Alexandria, but I found none. So then I went
to Santariyya, a place never visited by a Jew, since it is a rough
country with no water, a desert with no vegetation,
no wood for fuel and no pasture for the camels, whose fodder must be carried from afar.
I experienced hardships on the Sabbaths that I am unable to describe. 
From there I traveled to the Oasis, on a stretch of land still more difficult and more terrible than the one
I’ve described, and then to Upper Egypt and down to Fustat — altogether six months. 
For the Sabbaths and holidays and for protection, I spent 7½ dīnārs, so that
I had only a little over 2 dīnārs left. Thus, I passed a year and a half in other people's houses without rest or comfort,
most of the time begging for a liter of barley,
which I ground with my own hands in strange people’s places. 
From Lukk, I sent two flatcakes of unleavened barley bread, each weighing only 15
dirhams, with Ben Ṭibān to show them the food l lived on. My son took
advantage of my absence and left his job in the country and went to Alexandria. Some said that he also traveled to
Tripoli. He thought I would never be seen again. ln my house, there was a rabble of mankind with drums and
flutes and music, and all [the property] I had left was gone. He sold everything he found in the house,
all that had been spared from his former exploits.
Thus he ruined me, in addition to causing trouble the likes of which no one has ever experienced. I lived
in Fustat for two months on the Street of the Lentil Cooks, since I feared that the qāḍī
would put me in charge of a ship going to al-Andalus. Al-Qayṣarānī owed me a bahār [three hundred pounds] of pepper
and one of lacquer. When I went to collect them, I found he had died and his house was sealed. When I looked for al-
Māṭishī, he had gone. Then I traveled to Alexandria during the week before
Passover, and I arrived there on the eve of the holiday. I found my house ruined, and nothing fit for sale left in it. So I took a [sheep] hide that
I had bought before my departure and two Chinese [or porcelain in the Chinese style] dishes and sold them
on the market. As expected, the magistrate sent word that he wanted me to embark on a ship headed for al-Andalus. l explained
my situation to him, whereupon he put me in charge of two ships heading
for al-Mahdiyya and reassured me, saying: “An overseer [of ships] cannot be prosecuted.
I take responsibility for this.” I could not disobey him. But I complained to him about the good-for-nothing [son] and said, “ln the end, he will
sell the doors of my house and ruin it entirely.” On hearing this, the magistrate had the boy appear before him, and made him take the most solemn oath
that he would travel with me. Thus we were about to depart, but God
had not yet willed that we sail, for my son couldn’t leave because of
his many debts and the promissory notes he had signed. I paid everything the night before our departure.
By God's covenant, I ended up with no more than thirty-five dirhams, which I left
to his brothers. On our voyage we experienced misfortunes and tribulations. Moreover,
I lacked provisions, because I was overtaken by our sudden departure. As God is my witness and judge, not one loaf of bread
went with me on board. A favorable wind started to blow at early dawn Friday,
so that we found no time to bake or to prepare anything before sailing. We came back,
and I hoped that he would have learned from our hard experience. However, his gratitude to God
manifested itself only in that he relapsed into his old ways. I myself was stripped of everything, and all I had with me was
a basket of indigo and a bahār of lacquer, and this was taken from me and sequestered. To explain all this would take too much time. 
After this, I and the elderly lady [the boy’s grandmother] asked Abū l-Munā, the director of finances of the Buḥayra district,
to take him into his employ. We entreated him, and he, Abū l-Munā, did not disappoint us. He [the young man]
had it better with him than with his own grandfather, when the latter was still alive. We were happy, and we believed
that he would renounce the company of the musicians. However, after having been away for the month of Elul, he missed
being in the company of the musicians and appeared again in Alexandria. When questioned, he explained that he had come on business, but would return after the High Holiday.

However, the holidays passed and he relapsed into his old habit, racked up debts, signed promissory notes and, when he had to flee from the European wine-seller and others [due to debts], went up the Nile to Fustat. Shortly before Purim, I, too, went up [to Fustat] to get goods on commission, to assist me on my impending voyage. I met him in al-Buḥayra. He had received a letter from our lord the gaʾon and returned with him to Fustat. l arrived on the day of Purim, and was busy with my lawsuit against Tamīm until Passover. Several merchants intended to entrust me with some buhārs of lacquer. When they learned, however, that l was an overseer of the government’s ships, they held back and refrained from doing so. Thus I left Fustat during the middle days of Passover, and, by God’s covenant, without taking dirhams with me in the amount of half a dīnār for the expenses of my journey. Abū Zikrī as-Sijilmāsī was the only one who granted me a loan. 
On my arrival in Alexandria, I found that the ships already had been pushed off into the sea. l explained my plight to the magistrate and informed him that no one had entrusted me with goods, and I had no merchandise of my own to support my son and me. I had left my son in Fuwwa, for he could not enter Alexandria for fear of the European merchants. I swore to him [the magistrate]: “I do not even have money for provisions, nor will I get remuneration from you. In short, I cannot undertake the journey.” Hearing this, he shouted at me angrily and left me in the clutches of the Europeans, who brought me before the qāḍī and caused me great trouble. 
ln the midst of these calamities, my son came to Alexandria and I informed him that I was out of work and in dire straits. I let someone talk to the Europeans, paid them what my son owed them and took the promissory notes from them.

While in Old Cairo, my son was fooled by Ibn Baqā in revenge for his having cursed him in Alexandria. Ibn Baqā said to him: “I shall give you a loan of twenty dīnārs, properly witnessed, on which you can make a living, even though you are at present broke and without proper clothing.” My son accepted [this] and wrote the promissory note, but Ibn Baqā didn’t give him anything,
