                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In your name, O merciful.</li>
<li>I am writing to you my lord, the most illustrious elder &mdash;</li>
<li>may God prolong the life of your excellency and make permanent your honored position, affluence, highness, eminence and power,</li>
<li>and humiliate your enemies and all who envy you &mdash; to inform you that if I tried to</li>
<li>describe only a fraction of the troubles, tribulations and humiliations that I have endured in</li>
<li>this world, the account would be too long; no letter could contain them</li>
<li>and no epistle do them justice. In addition to the troubles</li>
<li>that I previously had to bear, I was overtaken by the disaster caused by the Monk. I fled</li>
<li>to Lukk, and this was most unfortunate: had I gone to the countryside or to</li>
<li>Upper Egypt, I would have fared better. A man stronger</li>
<li>than me would have weakened on this journey. But this is what God willed.&nbsp;When leaving [Alexandria], I had</li>
<li>ten dīnārs with me. For twenty-five days I was traveling. Then I was overtaken by</li>
<li>the Feast of Passover. During the eight months that I spent in Lukk, bad news continued to come from home.</li>
<li>At the end of the [Jewish] month of Elul [August&ndash;September], I went to Barqa for the High Holidays and</li>
<li>the Fast. Then, when I learned of the death of the one whose bones will be ground in hell [the Monk],</li>
<li>I returned to Lukk to join other travelers going to Alexandria, but I found none.&nbsp;So then I went</li>
<li>to Santariyya, a place never visited by a Jew, since it is a rough</li>
<li>country with no water, a desert with no vegetation,</li>
<li>no wood for fuel and no pasture for the camels, whose fodder must be carried from afar.</li>
<li>I experienced hardships on the Sabbaths that I am unable to describe.&nbsp;</li>
<li>From there I traveled to the Oasis, on a stretch of land still more difficult and more terrible than the one</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve described, and then to Upper Egypt and down to Fustat &mdash; altogether six months.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For the Sabbaths and holidays and for protection, I spent 7&frac12; dīnārs, so that</li>
<li>I had only a little over 2 dīnārs left. Thus, I passed a year and a half in other people's houses without rest or comfort,</li>
<li>most of the time begging for a liter of barley,</li>
<li>which I ground with my own hands in strange people&rsquo;s places.&nbsp;</li>
<li>From Lukk, I sent two flatcakes of unleavened barley bread, each weighing only 15</li>
<li>dirhams, with Ben Ṭibān to show them the food l lived on.&nbsp;My son took</li>
<li>advantage of my absence and left his job in the country and went to Alexandria. Some said that he also traveled to</li>
<li>Tripoli. He thought I would never be seen again. ln my house, there was a rabble of mankind with drums and</li>
<li>flutes and music, and all [the property] I had left was gone. He sold everything he found in the house,</li>
<li>all that had been spared from his former exploits.</li>
<li>Thus he ruined me, in addition to causing trouble the likes of which no one has ever experienced.&nbsp;I lived</li>
<li>in Fustat for two months on the Street of the Lentil Cooks, since I feared that the qāḍī</li>
<li>would put me in charge of a ship going to al-Andalus. Al-Qayṣarānī owed me a bahār [three hundred pounds] of pepper</li>
<li>and one of lacquer. When I went to collect them, I found he had died and his house was sealed. When I looked for al-</li>
<li>Māṭishī, he had gone.&nbsp;Then I traveled to Alexandria during the week before</li>
<li>Passover, and I arrived there on the eve of the holiday. I found my house ruined, and nothing fit for sale left in it. So I took a [sheep] hide that</li>
<li>I had bought before my departure and two Chinese [or porcelain in the Chinese style] dishes and sold them</li>
<li>on the market.&nbsp;As expected, the magistrate sent word that he wanted me to embark on a ship headed for al-Andalus. l explained</li>
<li>my situation to him, whereupon he put me in charge of two ships heading</li>
<li>for al-Mahdiyya and reassured me, saying: &ldquo;An overseer [of ships]&nbsp;cannot be prosecuted.</li>
<li>I take responsibility for this.&rdquo; I could not disobey him. But I complained to him about the good-for-nothing [son] and said, &ldquo;ln the end, he will</li>
<li>sell the doors of my house and ruin it entirely.&rdquo; On hearing this, the magistrate had the boy appear before him, and made him take the most solemn oath</li>
<li>that he would travel with me.&nbsp;Thus we were about to depart, but God</li>
<li>had not yet willed that we sail, for my son couldn&rsquo;t leave because of</li>
<li>his many debts and the promissory notes he had signed. I paid everything the night before our departure.</li>
<li>By God's covenant, I ended up with no more than thirty-five dirhams, which I left</li>
<li>to his brothers.&nbsp;On our voyage we experienced misfortunes and tribulations. Moreover,</li>
<li>I lacked provisions, because I was overtaken by our sudden departure. As God is my witness and judge, not one loaf of bread</li>
<li>went with me on board. A favorable wind started to blow at early dawn Friday,</li>
<li>so that we found no time to bake or to prepare anything before sailing.&nbsp;We came back,</li>
<li>and I hoped that he would have learned from our hard experience. However, his gratitude to God</li>
<li>manifested itself only in that he relapsed into his old ways. I myself was stripped of everything, and all I had with me was</li>
<li>a basket of indigo and a bahār of lacquer, and this was taken from me and sequestered. To explain all this would take too much time.&nbsp;</li>
<li>After this, I and the elderly lady [the boy&rsquo;s grandmother] asked Abū l-Munā, the director of finances of the Buḥayra district,</li>
<li>to take him into his employ. We entreated him, and he, Abū l-Munā, did not disappoint us. He [the young man]</li>
<li>had it better with him than with his own grandfather, when the latter was still alive. We were happy, and we believed</li>
<li>that he would renounce the company of the musicians. However, after having been away for the month of Elul, he missed</li>
<li>being in the company of the musicians and appeared again in Alexandria. When questioned, he explained that he had come on business, but would return after the High Holiday.</li>
