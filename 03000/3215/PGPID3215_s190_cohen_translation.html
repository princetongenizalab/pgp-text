<li>"May the Lord answer you in time of trouble, the name of Jacob's God keep you safe" (Psalm 20:2).&nbsp;</li>
<li>"May He send you help from the sanctuary, and sustain you from Zion" (Psalm 20:3).</li>
<li>"He cares about the poor and the needy; He brings the needy deliverance&rdquo; (Psalm 72:13).&nbsp;</li>
<li>To your honor, greatness, and holiness, the excellent diadem and crown and good name from on high.</li>
<li>To our master and teacher our lord David the great nasi, head of the diasporas of all Israel,</li>
<li>may God protect you and grant long life to our lord and may our Creator guard you and may God grant</li>
<li>that you see sons from your loins taking your place and the place of your righteous</li>
<li>fathers, and may He lengthen your days and years with pleasantness, amen.</li>
<li>Your slave woman, poor, wretched, woeful, worried, and afflicted</li>
<li>on account of my sins&mdash;I cast my entrea[t]y&nbsp; [...] before you, so that you heed the words of</li>
<li>your slave, for many are my sighs and my he[ar]t is sick. I am on my own. I have neither</li>
<li>husband nor son nor daughter nor brother nor sister, and I wander about like a lonesome bird</li>
<li>on a rooftop. Because my sins and iniquities multiplied I became afflicted on my nose, then the</li>
<li>malady spread and my face became wasted and eaten away. The disease gets worse and worse</li>
<li>and I cannot work. Meanwhile I am naked, thirsty, destitute,</li>
<li>and have no means of sustenance. Nobody takes care of me, even if I were to die.</li>
<li>Therefore, I cast myself down before the Lord and before my lord, so that you might take pity on me in your kindness</li>
<li>and act toward me for the sake of the Lord and for the sake of the merit of your righteous and pious</li>
<li>fathers, "and d[ecr]ee and it will be fulfilled, and light</li>
<li>will shine upon your affairs" (Job 22:28). May my lord order a pe[s]iqa in every place our lord wishes,</li>
<li>whether in Cairo or in "the city," so that I may be given compassion and respite by the Lord and by you.</li>
<li>Do not turn me away empty-hande[d ... and d]isappointed by you. I shall pray</li>
<li>to [the Lord] and for your generou[s ... ] name. [... May] Almighty God bless you and make you flourish</li>
<li>and great, so that you become a congregation of peoples, and may He give [y]ou and your descendants</li>
<li>the blessing of Abraham, and may your welfare grow and in[cr]ease and [may your] hono[r] grow great,</li>
<li>and for everything, may it become great foreve[r and] ever. Amen.&nbsp;</li>
