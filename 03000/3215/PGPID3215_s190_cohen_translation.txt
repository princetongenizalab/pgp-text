"May the Lord answer you in time of trouble, the name of Jacob's God keep you safe" (Psalm 20:2). 
"May He send you help from the sanctuary, and sustain you from Zion" (Psalm 20:3).
"He cares about the poor and the needy; He brings the needy deliverance” (Psalm 72:13). 
To your honor, greatness, and holiness, the excellent diadem and crown and good name from on high.
To our master and teacher our lord David the great nasi, head of the diasporas of all Israel,
may God protect you and grant long life to our lord and may our Creator guard you and may God grant
that you see sons from your loins taking your place and the place of your righteous
fathers, and may He lengthen your days and years with pleasantness, amen.
Your slave woman, poor, wretched, woeful, worried, and afflicted
on account of my sins—I cast my entrea[t]y  [...] before you, so that you heed the words of
your slave, for many are my sighs and my he[ar]t is sick. I am on my own. I have neither
husband nor son nor daughter nor brother nor sister, and I wander about like a lonesome bird
on a rooftop. Because my sins and iniquities multiplied I became afflicted on my nose, then the
malady spread and my face became wasted and eaten away. The disease gets worse and worse
and I cannot work. Meanwhile I am naked, thirsty, destitute,
and have no means of sustenance. Nobody takes care of me, even if I were to die.
Therefore, I cast myself down before the Lord and before my lord, so that you might take pity on me in your kindness
and act toward me for the sake of the Lord and for the sake of the merit of your righteous and pious
fathers, "and d[ecr]ee and it will be fulfilled, and light
will shine upon your affairs" (Job 22:28). May my lord order a pe[s]iqa in every place our lord wishes,
whether in Cairo or in "the city," so that I may be given compassion and respite by the Lord and by you.
Do not turn me away empty-hande[d ... and d]isappointed by you. I shall pray
to [the Lord] and for your generou[s ... ] name. [... May] Almighty God bless you and make you flourish
and great, so that you become a congregation of peoples, and may He give [y]ou and your descendants
the blessing of Abraham, and may your welfare grow and in[cr]ease and [may your] hono[r] grow great,
and for everything, may it become great foreve[r and] ever. Amen.
