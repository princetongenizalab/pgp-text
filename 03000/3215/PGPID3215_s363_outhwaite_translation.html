                        <ol>
<li>‘The Lord answer you in the day of trouble! The name of the God of  Jacob protect you!’ (Pss 20:2).  </li>
<li>‘May He send you help from the sanctuary, and give you support from  Zion’ (Pss 20:3).  </li>
<li>‘He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the  needy’ (Pss 72:13).  </li>
<li>To the honourable, great and holy, glorious crown and diadem, a good  name from above.  </li>
<li>To our master and teacher, our lord David the Great Prince, Head of all  Israel in Exile,  </li>
<li>may our God keep him and our Lord preserve him and our Creator protect him, and may God allow him  </li>
<li>to see male offspring from his loins, to take his place and the place of  his righteous ancestors.  </li>
<li>May He extend his days and his years in delight. Amen.</li>
<li>Your poor maidservant – pathetic, grief-stricken, wretched, worried and impoverished  </li>
<li>by my sins – I hereby present my supplication [before the Lord and]  before you, that you may pay heed to the words of  </li>
<li>your maidservant, ‘because my sighs are many and my heart is [faint]’ (Lam 1:22), for I am all alone: I have neither  </li>
<li>husband, nor son, nor daughter, nor brother, nor sister. I am ‘like a  lonely bird  </li>
<li>on a rooftop’ (Pss 102:8). As my sins and my transgressions increased,  I developed a serious affliction upon my nose,  </li>
<li>and the infection spread, and it festered and my face was eaten away. This disease is worsening,  </li>
<li>and I cannot perform any work. I am naked, thirsty, and I lack</li>
<li>everything. I am powerless. There is no one to take care of me, even if  I were to die.  </li>
<li>Now then, [I] throw myself down before the Lord and before my lord,  that you might show pity to me, according to your kindness,  </li>
<li>and take action for me, for the sake of the Lord and the sake of the  merit of your righteous,  </li>
<li>pious and pure ancestors. ‘You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light [will shine] on your ways’ (Job 22:28).</li>
<li>And may my lord order a charitable collection in any place that our  lord desires,  </li>
<li>either in Cairo or the city, that I may find compassion and respite  from the Lord and from you.  </li>
<li>And let my lord not send me back empty-handed […] and humiliated from him. I shall be praying  </li>
<li>to the Lord for your pleasant and good name. And may God Almighty bless you, make you fruitful  </li>
<li>and multiply you, so that you become a congregation of nations, and  may He give Abraham’s blessing to you  </li>
<li>and to your descendants with you. And may your wellbeing increase and grow, and may your honour accrue  </li>
<li>and become greater than all others’, forever and for all eternity.  Amen.  </li>
