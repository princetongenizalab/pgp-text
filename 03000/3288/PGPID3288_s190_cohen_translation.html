                        <p>"Happy shall you be who sow by [all waters, Who let loose the feet of (cattle) and (asses)" (Isaiah 32:20).</p>
<p>"Happy are those who act justly, who do right at all times" (Psalm 106:3). "Happy is he who is thoughtful of the wretched; in bad times may (the Lord) keep him from harm" (Psalm 41:2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>"May the Lord guard him and preserve him; and may he be thought happy in the land. Do not s(ubject him) t(o the will of his) e(nemies)" (Psalm 41:3).</p>
<p>My masters the "courts," (may their) R(ock) p(rotect them), and the community, may they be blessed, are aware of the current situation and how difficult it has been for those with means, all the more so the weak and poor. I am a woman with poor sight. I cannot [dis]tinguish night from day and cannot find my way since my husband le[ft me and f]led to Alexandria and left me a "widow during (his) lifetime". In my charge is an infant girl three years old. We are starving, naked, and lacking strength. Were it not for God the exalted and the elder Abū ʿAlī, (may his) R(ock) p(rotect him), who remembers us occasionally, we would not be in any shape. I call out concernng my situation to God and the community, may they b[e] blessed, to look into my situation before I die of starvation and hopefully put together something that I can "cover myself" [with, and] may your reward from heaven be doubled. May [your] welfare [increase for ev]er.&nbsp;</p>
