. . . we suffered hardship and did not hear about the escape, for we came near to the capital]
Qaṣab ṭīna (Constantinople). After we had cruised on the sea for eighteen days he attacked us again. Then it became evident that they
were on their way to one of the coasts of the Muslims. So we returned to Crete. We did not
cease to gulp our blood until we arrived in Amalfi after more than seventy days.
This was not enough: We came to a town whose property had been confiscated and we did not find
anyone who would buy any goods from us, be it pepper or olibanum (Iuban) or anything else,
not even one dirhem's worth. We put our goods in warehouses and are now waiting
for God's help. I do not worry for my own things. I worry for you and
your goods that I am unable to sell. I really regret this very much....

Please inform the elder Abu Ί-Fadl b. Salman that I went to see Yuhanna (spelled yhri), I and the elder Abu Sahl, and gave him the letter, but he did not answer it. Until now I have been reminding him, to find out what he would say. If I get something from Yuhanna, I shall send it to him.
