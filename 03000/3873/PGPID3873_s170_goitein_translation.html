<li>. . . we suffered hardship and did not hear about the escape, for we came near to the capital]</li>
<li>Qaṣab ṭīna (Constantinople). After we had cruised on the sea for eighteen days he attacked us again. Then it became evident that they</li>
<li>were on their way to one of the coasts of the Muslims. So we returned to Crete. We did not</li>
<li>cease to gulp our blood until we arrived in Amalfi after more than seventy days.</li>
<li>This was not enough: We came to a town whose property had been confiscated and we did not find</li>
<li>anyone who would buy any goods from us, be it pepper or olibanum (Iuban) or anything else,</li>
<li>not even one dirhem's worth. We put our goods in warehouses and are now waiting</li>
<li>for God's help. I do not worry for my own things. I worry for you and</li>
<li>your goods that I am unable to sell. I really regret this very much....</li>

                        <p>Please inform the elder Abu Ί-Fadl b. Salman that I went to see Yuhanna (spelled yhri), I and the elder Abu Sahl, and gave him the letter, but he did not answer it. Until now I have been reminding him, to find out what he would say. If I get something from Yuhanna, I shall send it to him.</p>
