Verso
May the elder A[bu]ʾl-ʿIzz pay the bearer [on]e dirhem because my need for it is 
urgent. God knows the situation I am in, so do not impede the messenger, but 
send him the dirhem quickly. May He open to you his treasure and relieve you 
from (having to resort to) human beings. May your welfare increase, as willed by 
him who lov[e]s you. Solomon (may) h(eaven) w(atch over him) and i(ncrease his 
good fortune).
