                        <p>May the elder A[bu]ʾl-ʿIzz pay the bearer [on]e dirhem because my need for it is&nbsp;</p>
<p>urgent. God knows the situation I am in, so do not impede the messenger, but&nbsp;</p>
<p>send him the dirhem quickly. May He open to you his treasure and relieve you&nbsp;</p>
<p>from (having to resort to) human beings. May your welfare increase, as willed by&nbsp;</p>
<p>him who lov[e]s you. Solomon (may) h(eaven) w(atch over him) and i(ncrease his&nbsp;</p>
<p>good fortune).</p>
