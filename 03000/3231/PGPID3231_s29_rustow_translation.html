                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>In your name, merciful one.</li>
<li>May God the exalted listen to what his servant implores of his excellency our lord,</li>
<li>his honor, greatness and holiness, our master and teacher Mevorakh, sagacious leader, sage of the yeshiva,&nbsp;</li>
<li>grand counsel, strength of the house of Israel, prince of princes, nagid</li>
<li>of nagids, may his glory be exalted and his honor be magnified, son of his honor, greatness and holiness our master and [teacher]</li>
<li>Saʿadya the physician, pious one of his generation, may the memory of the righteous be a blessing, and may the two honored princes live,</li>
<li>especially his honor, greatness and holiness, our master and teacher the rayyis Abū l-Bayān</li>
<li>Moshe, and may the rayyis Abū l-Barakāt (also) live. The servant has no tongue</li>
<li>to convey supplication and thanks for (even) some of the benefactions that his excellency has bestowed</li>
<li>upon his servant and for (the fact that) I am sitting among my children. To him ? from God</li>
<li>and some of his benefactions upon me. (Among them is the fact that) an appointment was validated among all the traders&nbsp;</li>
<li>who have obtained a tax-farm for his servant, as well as (the fact that he is) collecting money. But they are refu[sing]&nbsp;</li>
<li>me, since I'm not one of the group called the Banū Ḥujayla from Tyre. A[mong them]</li>
<li>there is a sinner. They hold the slave in contempt, since they enjoy bribery, may they be cursed.</li>
<li>They are scrutinizing me; everything I could add to their rank, they covet in me.</li>
<li>The Banū Ḥujayla have started mentioning that they are outbidding me in the dīwān,</li>
<li>and saying that they have a judge with them who is a cavalryman and a Qaraite, Ibn al-Bayrūtī, and that&nbsp;</li>
<li>al-Dhukhayra and Ibn Abī Sāma look after them. So they say. They went to</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>the tax-farm that is in</li>
<li>Minya, of which I am the tax-farmer</li>
<li>rather than them. They outbid me, and didn't</li>
<li>accept a greater (offer from me), even though they (the people in the dīwān? the traders?) said to them:&nbsp;</li>
<li>This tax-farmer (the petitioner) (received his appointment) from&nbsp;</li>
<li>Dhū al-Riʾāsatayn for three</li>
<li>years, and h[e has]</li>
<li>one and a half remaining. Let us not accept&nbsp;</li>
<li>a greater offer until he finishes (the term of his) tax-farm</li>
<li>and oath. Were it not for the fact that I don't</li>
<li>owe the fiscal officials (al-muʿāmilīn) any debts,</li>
<li>I wouldn't have troubled the prince</li>
<li>our lord, may his glory be exalted.</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, top margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>The servant awaits his recompense</li>
<li>from God and from his excellency,</li>
<li>and my redemption from the people of this group,</li>
<li>who are ruining me. If they keep&nbsp;</li>
<li>from me this year and a half without</li>
<li>surplus, then (I will be dependent) on God and his excellency.</li>
<li>And if they ?, then the slave</li>
<li>will accept it, since I owe debts</li>
<li>to the traders, and they are killing me. I beg</li>
<li>God and his grace to bestow upon me,</li>
<li>as he has bestowed on me before and</li>
<li>forever. Amen, may it be His will.</li>
