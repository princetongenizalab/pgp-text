<p>In (your) n(ame) O Me(rciful)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slave of your e[x]cellency our lord and Gaon Maṣliaḥ ha-Kohen, head of the Academy of the Pride (Gaon) of Jacob, may your glory be exalted and your greatness increase, and may He compensate you with a male child for the sake of His name, and fulfiill in him the verse "In place of your fathers will be your sons, you will app[oint them] Dignitaries throughout the land" (Psalm 45: 17), and may He grant him favor and [kindness] and mercy, fulfilling the saying, ("and you will) [find favor] and a[pprobation in the eyes] of God and man" (Proverbs 3:4).</p>
<p>I inform your excellency and great[n]ess that I am a b[lind] woman with a blind child [...]. They dem[anded from me] the p[oll ta]x and we two do not even have br[e]ad [...]. I ask God and your kindness [to give me] something to help me and my child against the troubles of [the time]. You will earn your reward and recompense. I have never imposed on your generosity, even though your kindness, which everyone seeks, is like the sea. Your slav[e] is known as the wife of Samu(e)l.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And [p]e[a]ce from your s[lave].</p>

                        <p>The people of al-Maḥalla know how weakened my situation is and how very poor I am. I have been in Fustat a month and have no[t] burdened anyone. Were it not for my exigency I would not [need to turn t]o you. May God the exalte[d make your h]igh [excellency] one of the besought [not a be]s[eecher], a refuge for the wretched and down and out and the needy p[oo]r. Amen, great salvation. And peace.</p>
