                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <p>I am writing to you, eminent elder and leader of the profession—</p>
<p>may God prolong your life, make your welfare and happiness per-manent, and increase his b[enefactions] to you and for you—on</p>
<p>Marheshvan 9th.6 I am well and in good health, thank God.</p>
<p>Your letters have arrived, my lord—may God support you—and</p>
<p>I was happy to learn that you were well. I praised God for this and</p>
<p>asked him to make this permanent in his grace.</p>
<p>Likewise, my lord, [the letters] of my two brothers—may God</p>
<p>keep them—have arrived reporting how kind you have been to them</p>
<p>and how much care you have given to their affairs. [They] thanked</p>
<p>God7 for this, my lord, in the presence of all those who know you8</p>
<p>and those who do not know you.</p>
<p>And I ask God to multiply people like you in the nation,9 for</p>
<p>you are its ornament. By my father—(may he) r(est in) p(eace),</p>
<p>although I am now back with my family, I am extremely unhappy10</p>
<p>to be separated from you. For being with you makes the soul strong</p>
<p>with God. I ask God to make your present state permanent, and to</p>
<p>keep you alive until you see your boys as my lord, the elder,11 (may</p>
<p>he) r(est in) p(eace), has seen you, namely that they will presently</p>
<p>become even more successful than you.12</p>
<p>B. SHIPMENT FOR THE TOP MERCHANT IN THE CITY</p>
<p>Your shipment for the elder, my lord Abu Zikri13—may God support</p>
<p>him—has arrived, my lord. These are unique, exquisite pieces,</p>
<p>each having feathering14 on its . . . ,15 incomparable. The festive <i>costume</i>18 <i>is even finer. It has been said that he was [offered] 60</i></p>
<p>dinars in cash for it. But he refused to sell it, for he wished to wear</p>
<p>it himself. The lead-gray robe is better than everything. I have forwarded</p>
<p>your letters to him.17</p>
<p>The servant, my lord, did not have this much inconvenience.18</p>
<p>The man19 seeks your friendship, [. . .] and (marital) connection</p>
<p>with you and wishes to derive profit from your honored position and</p>
<p>your advice for his undertakings. Had he a son fit to serve you as</p>
<p>an apprentice, he would have been honored by this.</p>
<p>His letters will be sent to you in the pilgrims' caravan.20</p>
<p>C. THE WRITER'S OWN SHIPMENT AND ORDERS</p>
<p>The cloaks21 sent by you have arrived, and I wish to thank you</p>
<p>for your kindness and exertion in this matter. You noted also that</p>
<p>the rest of the order had been carried out. All you have sent, my</p>
<p>lord, is fine, but I wish to ask you to buy everything all over again,</p>
<p>for the three robes striped with curved lines,22 as well as the white</p>
<p>robe which I wanted to have for me as a mantle, were taken from</p>
<p>me by a man who imposed on me. Present circumstances make such <i>things necessary; I cannot go into detail about this. May God save</i></p>
<p>us from what we fear. All I could say was that those garments were</p>
<p>for sale.23</p>
<p>I would like the robe to be deep red, as red as possible, and the</p>
<p>white and yellow also to be of excellent color. I did not like the color</p>
<p>of the yellow which arrived. Also, the white robe which is to serve</p>
<p>as mantle should be of the same quality. The best robes manufactured</p>
<p>are the old ones. It should be cut in two pieces.24 Its price</p>
<p>should be 2(5 dinars], or as you deem proper; 1 dinar more on a</p>
<p>robe having your approval is preferable to one not so good.</p>
<p>The Sigflaton]25 robe is of extreme beauty, but it is not the color</p>
<p>which they ordered. For this is white and blue, but instead I w[ished</p>
<p>to have] one of the blue onion color,26 an open color, according to</p>
<p>your taste. I wish to have the very best, as chosen by you.</p>
<p>I wish also to have two lead-gray robes with borders "filling your</p>
<p>eyes," each worth about 25 dinars, or a little more, provided they are</p>
<p>first class. Act according to your own judgment. I know that you,</p>
<p>may God support you, are eager to save a dirhem for me more than</p>
<p>I do, and you have also the capacity to do so.</p>
<p>Also (buy me) a white razl robe.27</p>
<p>The festive costume which I have ordered before, should be like</p>
<p>the one you sent to [my lord] Abu Zikri Judah—may God support</p>
<p>him.28 If you cannot obtain one like that, then it should be red,</p>
<p>striped with curved lines, like the robe which (my lord) Abi Ibrahim 'Ayyash29 had had made for himself and I do not care if</p>
<p>it costs ι or 2 dinars more.</p>
<p>The package forwarded by my lord Abi 'I-Hasan (?) 'All, the</p>
<p>son of the sister of the elder 'Allal,30 has arrived. But the 'attabi31</p>
<p>does not have such good going here. All that was obtained for the</p>
<p>package of 'attabi was 20 dinars.</p>
<p>(There follow about twenty partly effaced words).</p>
<p>D. URGENT APPEAL FOR THE WRITER'S BROTHERS</p>
<p>I have another wish, my lord. Should a caravan set out in which</p>
<p>trustworthy Muslims, who have given you sureties, will travel, let</p>
<p>the merchandise of my brothers be sent with them as if it were yours.</p>
<p>They would profit from this in many respects.32</p>
<p>The balance for the garments ordered will be sent to you with the</p>
<p>pilgrims' caravan in a purse of gold dinars.33</p>
<p>My lord, I do not need to entreat you to take care of my brothers—</p>
<p>may God keep them—their soul lives only34 . . . because they are</p>
<p>with you. In a place where you are they are no strangers. May God</p>
<p>protect me through you.35</p>
<p>(There follows a short, only pardy preserved passage dealing with</p>
<p>a lawsuit concerning a flask worth 22 dinars, probably containing</p>
<p>musk). <i>A letter from you, my lord, with a report on your state and welfare</i></p>
<p>and any order you may have will give me pleasure and will be sure</p>
<p>of my recognition and thanks. Best regards to your dear selves and</p>
<p>to my lords Abu Nasr, Abu Sa'd, and Abu [Mansur]3®—may God</p>
<p>let you see all your hopes fulfilled in them—and to all encompassed</p>
<p>by your care.</p>
<p>(Address. Right side:)</p>
<p>To my elder and illustrious leader Abu Ί-Fadl, Abu Jacob, and</p>
<p>Abu Sahl, Sahl, Joseph, and Sa'id, the sons of Israel, may God prolong</p>
<p>their lives.87</p>
<p>(Left side:)</p>
<p>From Musa and Isaac, the sons of Barhun, (may his) s(oul) r(est</p>
<p>in peace).</p>
