                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <p>I am writing to you, eminent elder and leader of the profession&mdash;may God prolong your life, make your welfare and happiness per-manent, and increase his b[enefactions] to you and for you&mdash;on Marheshvan 9th. I am well and in good health, thank God. Your letters have arrived, my lord&mdash;may God support you&mdash;and I was happy to learn that you were well. I praised God for this and asked him to make this permanent in his grace. Likewise, my lord, [the letters] of my two brothers&mdash;may God keep them&mdash;have arrived reporting how kind you have been to them and how much care you have given to their affairs. [They] thanked God for this, my lord, in the presence of all those who know you and those who do not know you. And I ask God to multiply people like you in the nation, for you are its ornament. By my father&mdash;(may he) r(est in) p(eace), although I am now back with my family, I am extremely unhappy to be separated from you. For being with you makes the soul strong with God. I ask God to make your present state permanent, and to keep you alive until you see your boys as my lord, the elder, (may he) r(est in) p(eace), has seen you, namely that they will presently become even more successful than you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your shipment for the elder, my lord Abū Zikrī&mdash;may God support him&mdash;has arrived, my lord. These are unique, exquisite pieces, each having feathering on its . . . , incomparable. The festive costume&nbsp;is even finer. It has been said that he was [offered] 60 dinars in cash for it. But he refused to sell it, for he wished to wear it himself. The lead-gray robe is better than everything. I have forwarded your letters to him. The servant, my lord, did not have this much inconvenience. The man seeks your friendship, [. . .] and (marital) connection with you and wishes to derive profit from your honored position and your advice for his undertakings. Had he a son fit to serve you as an apprentice, he would have been honored by this. His letters will be sent to you in the pilgrims' caravan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cloaks sent by you have arrived, and I wish to thank you for your kindness and exertion in this matter. You noted also that the rest of the order had been carried out. All you have sent, my lord, is fine, but I wish to ask you to buy everything all over again, for the three robes striped with curved lines, as well as the white robe which I wanted to have for me as a mantle, were taken from me by a man who imposed on me. Present circumstances make such&nbsp;things necessary; I cannot go into detail about this. May God save us from what we fear. All I could say was that those garments were for sale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like the robe to be deep red, as red as possible, and the white and yellow also to be of excellent color. I did not like the color of the yellow which arrived. Also, the white robe which is to serve as mantle should be of the same quality. The best robes manufactured are the old ones. It should be cut in two pieces. Its price should be 2(5 dinars], or as you deem proper; 1 dinar more on a robe having your approval is preferable to one not so good. The Sig[laton] robe is of extreme beauty, but it is not the color which they ordered. For this is white and blue, but instead I w[ished to have] one of the blue onion color, an open color, according to your taste. I wish to have the very best, as chosen by you. I wish also to have two lead-gray robes with borders "filling your eyes," each worth about 25 dinars, or a little more, provided they are first class. Act according to your own judgment. I know that you, may God support you, are eager to save a dirhem for me more than I do, and you have also the capacity to do so. Also (buy me) a white <i>rāzī</i> robe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The festive costume which I have ordered before, should be like the one you sent to [my lord] Abū Zikrī Judah&mdash;may God support him. If you cannot obtain one like that, then it should be red, striped with curved lines, like the robe which (my lord) Abī Ibrahīm ʿAyyāsh had had made for himself and I do not care if it costs 1 or 2 dinars more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The package forwarded by my lord Abi 'l-Ḥasan (?) ʿAlī, the son of the sister of the elder ʿAllāl, has arrived. But the ʿattābī does not have such good going here. All that was obtained for the package of ʿattābī was 20 dinars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(There follow about twenty partly effaced words).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another wish, my lord. Should a caravan set out in which trustworthy Muslims, who have given you sureties, will travel, let the merchandise of my brothers be sent with them as if it were yours. They would profit from this in many respects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The balance for the garments ordered will be sent to you with the pilgrims' caravan in a purse of gold dinars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My lord, I do not need to entreat you to take care of my brothers&mdash;may God keep them&mdash;their soul lives only . . . because they are with you. In a place where you are they are no strangers. May God protect me through you.</p>

                        <p>(There follows a short, only partly preserved passage dealing with a lawsuit concerning a flask worth 22 dinars, probably containing musk.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A letter from you, my lord, with a report on your state and welfare&nbsp;and any order you may have will give me pleasure and will be sure&nbsp;of my recognition and thanks. Best regards to your dear selves and&nbsp;to my lords Abū Naṣr, Abū Saʿd, and Abū [Manṣūr]&mdash;may God&nbsp;let you see all your hopes fulfilled in them&mdash;and to all encompassed&nbsp;by your care.</p>

                        <p>To my elder and illustrious leader Abu l-Faḍl, Abū Jacob, and Abu Sahl, Sahl, Joseph, and Saʿīd, the sons of Israel, may God prolong their lives.</p>
