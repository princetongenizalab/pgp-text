Truth.
May the shaykh Abū l-Mufaḍḍal
the scholar, may his Rock protect him, deliver
to the bearer (of this letter), the esteemed elder
m[ister] Yaʿaqov, the representative of the
masters—the most esteemed
shaykh al-Asʿad and the shaykh al-Thiqa,
may their Rock protect them— whatever sum of money he asks
for from my master
and debit me, and inform me
so that I will pay it back to you.
May God the exalted bring you success.
And peace.
