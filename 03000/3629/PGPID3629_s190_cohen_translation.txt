Recto
In the n(name of the) M(erciful) Your slave [who thanks you]
for your kindness,
Judah
I inform your excellency my master the most illustrious lord, the judge, (may your) R(ock) p(rotect you), that the bearer of this (letter) was one of the notables of Sunbāṭ. Their house was (open) to all wayfarers. He never sought anything from anybody, nor was this his habit. During these difficult times that befell everyone all was lost, and he is being sought for two poll-tax payments, his own and that of his son, as well as for another debt. I ask, please, that you take care of his situation and strive in his regard. And may the welfare of your excellency increase forever and ever.
