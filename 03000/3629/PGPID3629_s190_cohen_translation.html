<li>I inform your excellency my master the most illustrious lord, the judge,</li>
<li>(may your) R(ock) p(rotect you), that the bearer of this (letter) was one of the notables of Sunbāṭ.</li>
<li>Their house was (open) to all wayfarers. He never sought anything from anybody,</li>
<li>nor was this his habit. During these difficult times that befell everyone</li>
<li>all was lost, and he is being sought for two poll-tax payments, his own and that</li>
<li>of his son, as well as for another debt. I ask, please, that you take care of</li>
<li>his situation and strive in his regard. And may the welfare of your excellency increase</li>
<li>forever and ever.&nbsp;</li>
