<li>[...] the first among the foremost, He who is adorned with the crown, "Final and First,"</li>
<li>who hears the whispered voice and listens to utterance and tongue, may He guard them</li>
<li>"as the pupil (of one's eye)" (cf. Deuteronomy 32: 10), and make them to dwell with Naḥshon on high as at first,</li>
<li>men of truth, despisers of gain, doers of lovingkindness and pursuers of charity,</li>
<li>guardians of salvation whose bread is available to every wayfarer and passerby,</li>
<li>holy communities scattered to all (the world's) comers: may it be the will of</li>
<li>the Master of peace to make them dwell as a crown of peace. Now, our dignitaries and masters,</li>
<li>we, the community of Kiev, inform you of the troublesome affair of this Mar Jacob b.</li>
<li>Ḥanukkah, who is from a [good] family. He was of the givers and not of the</li>
<li>takers, until a cruel Fate was decreed against him, in that his brother went</li>
<li>and took mone[y] from gentiles; this Jacob stood surety. His brother went on the road, and there came</li>
<li>[bri]gands who slew him and took his money. Then came the creditors</li>
<li>[and t]ook this (man) Jacob captive, they put chains of iron on his neck</li>
<li>and fetters about his legs. He stayed there an entire year [... and after]ward</li>
<li>&nbsp;we took him in surety; we paid out sixty [coins and there ye[t...]</li>
<li>remained forty coins; so we have sent him among the holy communities</li>
<li>that they might take pity on him. So now, O our masters, raise up your eyes to heaven</li>
<li>and do as is your goodly custom, for you know how great is the virtue</li>
<li>of charity. For "charity saves from death" (Proverbs 11:4). Nor are we as warners</li>
<li>but rather as those who remind. "It will be to your merit as an act of charity before the Lord your God" (Deuteronomy 24:13).</li>
<li>You shall eat (the) fruits (thereof) in this world, and the capital fund (of merit) shall be yours perpetually in the world to come.</li>
<li>Only be strong and of good courage, and do not put our words behind</li>
<li>your back; and may the Omnipresent bless you and build Jerusalem in your days</li>
<li>and redeem you and also u[s] with you. A(men?) A(men?) A(men?) BQZ</li>
