<li>The least of the servants of my lord,</li>
<li>Meir b. al-Hamadhānī</li>
<li>“But the lowly shall inherit the land and delight in abundant well-being.” [Psalms 37:11]</li>
<li>“Mark the blameless, note the upright, for there is a future for the man of integrity.” [Psalms 37:37]</li>
<li>“Let me hear what God, the Lord, will speak; He will promise well-being [to his people].” [Psalms 85:9]</li>
<li>“The Lord bestow His favor upon you and grant you peace!” [Num. 6:26]</li>
<li>May the many salutations, flowing from the four rivers of Paradise, supported by God’s </li>
<li>victorious right hand, and the abundant blessings written </li>
<li>in the Torah, the Mishnah, and the Gemara all be a crown of </li>
<li>majesty upon the head of his eminent dignity, diadem of glory, </li>
<li>our master and teacher, crown of our heads, Moses, the leading prince, </li>
<li>perfect as a full moon, the distinguished judge, </li>
<li>may our God preserve him and may the Holy One succor him, </li>
<li>raise his fortune and banner on high, fulfill all his needs, give life to his son, </li>
<li>and permit him to witness his joy and marriage. May (God) place (his son) upon his seat in his lifetime, and have him take the </li>
<li>place of his sacred ancestors. May he fulfill for him the words of Scripture, </li>
<li>"Your sons will succeed your ancestors; you will appoint them princes throughout the land.” Amen. Selah. Your servant kisses </li>
<li>the earth before the majlis of the lord, the most majestic head, man of knowledge and action, </li>
<li>the competent elder, may the star of his fortune never sink, and may his luck be forever</li>
<li>resplendent. May his success exceed his wish, and may blessings follow </li>
<li>his undertakings as he desires. May greetings for this felicitous </li>
<li>holiday of Passover reach him. May the Holy One, blessed be He, grant him delightful years,</li>
<li>"to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord, to frequent His temple.” And may he have the privilege of eating the Passover sacrifices </li>
<li>which shall be accepted by the Lord's altar with rejoicing, </li>
<li>he and his son and all his associates. Amen Selah. And (your servant) conveys his great </li>
<li>desire (to gaze upon) the freshness of his (lord’s) happy countenance, </li>
<li>his yearning for his fragrance, and his sorrow for forfeiting the harvest of his pearls of wisdom, the privilege of kissing the carpet of his </li>
<li>audience hall, basking in the luminance of his precious gems, and relishing his company-</li>
<li>what the tongue cannot describe nor the hand set down in writing. </li>
<li>May he continue to be well and secure as long as time lasts, and (may God) preserve him from vicissitudes. Our lord knows, </li>
<li>may God the exalted give him success, that human souls naturally seek </li>
<li>to ascend, and strive to accede </li>
<li>to the ultimate abodes of transition and eternity. They wish </li>
<li>this when the paths are pure and the passes secure, and strive </li>
<li>their utmost. And their Lord succeeds their way and guides them. </li>
<li>In view of the above, the son of your servant, Abū Manṣūr </li>
<li>has had the notion to join (our) lord, to enjoy the privilege of </li>
<li>his proximity and to become one of his assistants. For he found out that al-Shaykh </li>
<li>al-Talmid al-Zakī, the nephew of (our) lord, may God preserve him, has gone </li>
<li>elsewhere. If not for this, (Abū Manṣūr) would not dare </li>
<li>broach this matter. Who can don the garment of the proud and who can follow his ways? </li>
<li>If the lord desires to have him and responds favorably to his request and accepts him, let him favor him </li>
<li>with a note from his audience hall, so that (Abū Manṣūr) may present himself to him, in order that</li>
<li>his responsibilities may be decided, with the help of the Almighty. And he will follow what they order him to do. </li>
<li>Whatever arrangement there was with al-Shaykh al-Zakī he will surpass, and this is his aim... </li>
