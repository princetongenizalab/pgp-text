Recto
In (your) n(ame, O) Me(rciful) 
"For the work of charity shall be peace, and the effect of ch(arity, calm and confidence forever)" (Isaiah 32:17). 
“Happy is he who is thoughtful of the wretched; in bad times (may the Lord) keep him from harm" (Psalm 41:2). 
May God, may His mention be exalted, answer (my) pious prayers on behalf of my master the most illustrious elder and lengthen your days with goodness and your years with favor. Your slave turns to God, may He be praised, and to your noble excellency for help against Fate. I am burdened with a family and am out of work, unable to get a hold of anything for expenses, even for bread to satisfy them. The Creator knows how I desire to find that which would free me from the need to uncover my face. May God the exalted never keep your excellency from doing charity and may He make it stand in your favor when you are experiencing adversity. May your peace increase forever and ever. Selah. 
May salvation come.
