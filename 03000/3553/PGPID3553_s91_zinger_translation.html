<li>
<p>(1&ndash;6) ...] Mevorakh b. [Ephraim...] this Jacob and [...] dinars and [...] to the Muslim with these din[ars ...] Muslim to ʿAmram. ʿAmram saw fit [to sue?] this Jacob [and Bahiyya] the wife of [Mevora]kh in Jewish courts for he took pity on her honour&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for she is a married woman. Everyone gathered in court and several court sessions were held.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The judge (bet din) told them: "It is best that you reach a compromise between you&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in [Jewish] courts rather than go to Muslim courts, for the Muslim deed in&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;ʿAmram's possession is a verified deed." The judge and the elders sought to spare the woman,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;so the elders intervened and negotiated the matter. After they (i.e. the elders) determined that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;from (the sum) incumbent upon them (i.e. the couple) in the deed they owe forty-two dinars which they need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;to give ʿAmram today, ʿAmram saw fit, as an act of benevolence to them, to take from them&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;thirty dinars. As for the rest, he planned to ask the Muslim to give it to him as a gift.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;ʿAmram consented to this with a symbolic purchase. The elders ruled and implored the husband of the wife, Mevorakh,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;to give half of the thirty dinars so that&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;his wife would not be dragged to Muslim courts. He was unwilling to give the half. They cautioned him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;with soft and beneficial words until he gave ʿAmram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;eleven good and weighted dinars from the thirty dinars. [The rest was written as] a deed (of debt)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;against Jacob b. Yaʿīsh ha-Kohen, the brother of Bahiyya, the wife of Mevorakh b. Ephraim. All consented</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;to this compromise. When Mevorakh, Bahiyya's husband, gave ʿAmram the eleven&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;dinars, he asked that a verified deed of quittance be written for his wife&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;from ʿAmram and to take the Muslim deed in his (i.e. ʿAmram's) hand. Since what he asked was good,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;the judge ordered and wrote a deed of quittance for Bahiyya. This is its text:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;ʿAmram b. Yefet came to the judge and elders undersigned in this deed and said:&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Be my witnesses and make the symbolic purchase in every language of right, write and sign for me&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;your testimony. I am neither forced, compelled, nor deceived, but with a willing spirit.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;I free, release, and clear Bahiyya bt.&nbsp; Yaʿīsh [wife of] Mevorakh b. Ephraim from the deed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;I had against her in Muslim courts and I gave it to her husband, Mevorakh. No claim remains for me&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;against her either in Jewish or gentile courts. I cancel&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;any notification I may have given or will give from today to eternity. I absolve her completely and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;eternally in this (world) and the next. Neither a ban, an oath,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;a curse, a shifted (oath), nor a Torah (oath) remains for me against her. We made the symbolic purchase from ʿAmram b. Yefet, a complete and rigorous purchase&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;with a fitting instrument, a verified, validated, (and) without faults. Let this deed of release have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;the weight and veracity of all the release deeds instituted by our rabbis and used in the world. Written on&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Thursday, 20 of Av in Fustat-Mitzrayim situated upon the River Nile (in the) year&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;1368 AG (= 24 July 1057 CE). We gave this deed to Bahiyya as a right. "Bahiyya" is written (above the line).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(Signed:) Yeshuʿa ha-Levi b. Abraham, m(ay he rest in) p(eace).</p>
<p>Yefet b. Ṭoviyya ha-Levi, m(ay he rest in) p(eace).&nbsp;</p>

<p>(40) This deed was validated before us in our court, ʿEli he-Ḥaver b. ʿAmram, Nethanel b. ʿAmram, Yefet b.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(41) Ṭoviyya ha-Levi, m)ay he rest in) p(eace). [When] two witnesses [came] and showed that these are their signatures, we validated it (i.e. the deed) as is fitting.&nbsp;</p>
