Testimony of what transpired before us, we, the witnesses whose signatures are below. It happened thus: there appeared before us the elder Abū l-Surūr, our master and teacher,
our esteemed Peraḥya son of our master and teacher the honored elder ʿUlla, known as the elder Abū l-Munā al-ʿAṭṭār son of Ḥasan, may his end be good, and the elder Abū [Isḥāq],
our master and teacher the elder Avraham son of Yaʿaqov. Our master and teacher Avraham guaranteed (ḍamina) from the elder Abū l-Surūr, from the entirety of the ḍ[amān] 
in his hand, the sale of silk in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ in Fustat exclusively, from the beginning of the month of Adar of this [year],
which is the year 1449 according to the calendar of contracts, until the expiration of the ḍamān period of
the elder Abū l-Surūr. Whatever amount of the ḍamān he has in his hand, the amount (due) is 18 dinars per month
until the expiration of the ḍamān period of the elder Abū l-Surūr set by the dīwān, in accordance with the conditions that have been agreed upon between them.
Each of them undertook his obligation toward his partner willingly and freely. As for what is stipulated upon our master and teacher Avraham
the tax-farmer (al-ḍāmin), he must not sell even a single dirham’s worth of silk — neither more nor less — outside Qaṣr al-Shamʿ. 
Should he venture to sell any [silk] outside Qaṣr al-Shamʿ, the elder Abū l-Surūr, the muḍmin, will have the right 
to discharge him [of the ḍamān]. (Avraham) must not sell silk to the apprentices (ṣibyān) in the stores of the elder Abū l-Surūr, nor to the female agents (al-bayyāʿāt) who 
will be mentioned and specified in this deed. They include Umm Sayf, her partner Umm Ṭāhir, […,]
daughter of Khaṭṭāb, Umm Ẓāfir, the goldsmith’s wife, Taqiyya, and the maternal aunt of Abū l-Fatḥ. When the [ḍāmin] 
rescinds this ḍamān and asks to be exempted from it, he will owe the elder Abū l-Surūr 100 dīnārs 
as a debt and a gift from that moment. As for what is stipulated upon the elder Abū l-Surūr the muḍmin,
he must not receive for the lease of the elder Abū Isḥāq a higher bid (zāʾid) for the entire period of his ḍamān, nor withdraw (the ḍamān) from him.  
Should he do so, he will owe this Abū Isḥāq 100 dinars as a debt 
and gift from that moment. He (Abū Surūr) must not transfer his (Avraham’s) debt (to a third party — annahu lā yuḥīla ʿalayhi ḥawāla), nor raise legal objections against his selling of silk [….].
... he has the absolute right to sell silk wherever he desires, and to dye it wherever he wants, be it in his house […].
If he chose to open shops in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ for the purpose of selling silk in them, he will not deny him that, even if there are 
ten shops there. He will also not raise legal objections regarding him (against) anyone who buys silk from him in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ, namely [..] 
the assistants of the shops outside Qaṣr al -Shamʿ or the aforementioned female agents […] 
with them for himself. Any receipt (wuṣūl), debt transfer (ḥawāla), or loss (khisāra) that should befall the elder Abū Isḥāq, …
[Abū Isḥāq will give his trust] to him in that. Concerning what (Avraham) should report about his daily profits, (Avraham) is as trustworthy as two valid witnesses.
[…] He has no claim whatsoever against him; no oath (shevuʿa) for all time, even by way of rider oaths (gilgul)
or even ḥerem setam. He (Avraham) will receive enforcement (yushadd minhu) from the wālī in this ḍamān of his in accordance with what is necessary in such a situation, and he (the wālī) will defend 
him from the evading workshops (buyūt) and protect him from the harm of any workshop (bayt) that was reported to him to have evaded the payment of its obligation. Whenever (Abū al-Surūr) transfers debt to him (aḥāla ʿalayhi ḥawāla),
causes someone else to transfer debt to him (sababa ʿalayhi ḥawāla), sends police (raqqāṣ) for him, or writes a petition against him/writes him a money order (kataba ʿalayhi al-ruqʿa), he will owe him 10 
dīnārs as a binding debt. He will not impede any female agent from him, specifically in Qaṣr al-Sha[mʿ…],
and the sale of silk to anyone who buys [from him] in Qaṣr al-Shamʿ or enters Qaṣr al-Shamʿ, 
[(whether) a smal]l or large (amount), be he Upper Egyptian (Ṣaʿīdī) or not, he must not prevent them in this, and […]
[the female ag]ents mentioned and named above from the silk of  Qaṣr al-Shamʿ […]
their […] to him, this aforementioned tax-farmer (ḍāmin) has no business with them in this. He also released […]
[…] to the elder Abū Isḥāq the sale in these remaining ten days […]
the month of Shevaṭ of the aforementioned year. He also took it upon himself […]
that he will not open a shop for buying silk in competition with Abū Isḥāq, neither i[n…]
al-Fār, nor al-Ṣaffayn nor Sūq al- […]
