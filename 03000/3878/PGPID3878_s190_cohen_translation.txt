Recto
Moses, who thanks you 
I honor R. Amram ha-Levi, the precious, the honored, the scholar, may the Guardian of the souls of the Pious guard you and make prosper your works, with best regards and a thousand greetings and the respect of Moses, who thanks you, without intending any ill-will. I sent your excellency a petition, which includes some of my complaints about my situation and the severe and ever-increasing straits in which I stuff[er]. But I have not received an an[s]wer. As 
God is my witness, today I am in even greater straits, and facing the greatest  
adversity yet. Far be it from the virtuous generosity of my master that he  
should neglect someone in this great trouble, who turns to him for help. In fact,  
you should favor me without my having to turn to you. As God is my witness, in my house there is no [...] wheat or flour or loaf of bread or any other food, as God is witness to its (exorbitant) price. I asked your excellency for half a wayba of wheat, or money to buy it, so I can make my young ones happy this week.  
After the break for the holiday I tried to get a quarter of a dirhem, and couldn't.  
As God sees what's best, I am describing only part of my complaint to God the  
exalted [...] His name. And may your welfare increase.
