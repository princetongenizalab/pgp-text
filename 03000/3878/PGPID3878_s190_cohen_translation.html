                        <p>Moses, who thanks you&nbsp;</p>
<p>I honor R. Amram ha-Levi, the precious, the honored, the scholar, may the Guardian of the souls of the Pious guard you and make prosper your works, with best regards and a thousand greetings and the respect of Moses, who thanks you, without intending any ill-will. I sent your excellency a petition, which includes some of my complaints about my situation and the severe and ever-increasing straits in which I stuff[er]. But I have not received an an[s]wer. As&nbsp;</p>
<p>God is my witness, today I am in even greater straits, and facing the greatest&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>adversity yet. Far be it from the virtuous generosity of my master that he&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>should neglect someone in this great trouble, who turns to him for help. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>you should favor me without my having to turn to you. As God is my witness, in my house there is no [...] wheat or flour or loaf of bread or any other food, as God is witness to its (exorbitant) price. I asked your excellency for half a wayba of wheat, or money to buy it, so I can make my young ones happy this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the break for the holiday I tried to get a quarter of a dirhem, and couldn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As God sees what's best, I am describing only part of my complaint to God the&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>exalted [...] His name. And may your welfare increase.</p>
