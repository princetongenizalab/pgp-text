 the fear my father, m(ay he rest in) E(den), was in, for he feared my husband greatly. He (i.e. my husband) told me:

and not hurt you.” He wrote a bill of divorce with an early date, so that If I have need (12) of it I will s[ho]w it to be divorced. I do not know whether [.....] or not. When

 come. I went to Cairo for my demand [for his return (?) to] my home, except if he would put my heart at ease 


and come to Fustat, for there is a condition obligating him not to lodge me in Cairo. He an[swered] 


to my face: “You have no home with me.” I asked him: “[For] what reason?” He said: “You will not [...] 


until you agree to a delayed marriage gift of two dinars.” I left the city (i.e. Cairo) to my home [...] 


five months. He provided neither for me nor for my family. I [lef]t the matter to his gentlemanly character and tho[ught] 


that the matter would be settled and we would not burden his Excellency, our lord. However, when he sensed that I 


intended to inform his excellency of my matter, he started demanding reconciliation (ṣulḥ) between us according to what 


he thought best [...] I refused to do that,


 except according to the opinion of your excellency, our lord, and according to what the law of Israel (sharʿ yisraʾel) requires. 


The servant [asks] that my case be presented before you and you would examine my situation. For I am a desolate [woman],


I have no man. I have only God, the exalted, //?// and your excellency. [Your excellency is?]
