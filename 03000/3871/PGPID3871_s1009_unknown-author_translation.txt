Recto 


My lord, teacher and mentor of renowned prestige, may God preserve your health, shower you with compassion, 


grant you access to success […]  and and will bring your desires fulfils, namely, […] and likewise to have that  which pleases Him for them 


[…] with His force. My lord, may God prolong your life, protect you from the vicissitudes of fate and allow you to maintain your superior status,


[…] to you [… … … …  … … …]


…] my lord, I am a man of the people of al-Andalus, from the  city are of [G/J…]


 I come from the Karaites and decided [to travel] to  Jerusalem, May the Merciful build it [in our days …] […]


I left […] with  what I gave him and I left behind a father, mother, brothers, sisters and the  entire family


 […] according to His will and design, He is terrible in his  doing toward the children of men (Psalm 66:5).  I say in reference to […]


 […] my lord, all I had with me was two dinars  and I spent them […]


to accommodate everyone and I have nothing left.  I got by with what I need by asking after […]


the rabbis because I did not  renounce the Karaites, I was boarded at sea and then they treated me with all  kinds of favours […]


and in the first place to ask the God of Israel to increase His mercy towards them and show them the right path so that they follow it. Then, my Lord, I reached


Alexandria and the Alexandrians treated  me with all kinds of favours because the good hand of God was upon me (Nehemiah 2:8), may God increase towards them


His mercy and compassion  and show them the right path. Then, the Alexandrians wrote about me to some of our rabbi co-religionist


so that they would not ignore me and would treat me with favour and grace, my Lord, I do not like that, if the Karaites are not informed


with whom I share customs and beliefs, as it is written I am a companion of all that fear thee (Psalm 119:63) and as it continues. Now, my lord and beloved of the soul,


 I ask a favour of the God of Israel and you all […] exemplary persons and illustrious and generous persons,  may peace be with them, that they give me


something of them and you treat me with grace and favour since God has sent me amongst you. I ask you as


I have asked others. You, my lord, do with me in this respect as you please and as befits your good works and your good practices


with my lords and teachers in the Karaites, may God keep them and prolong their lives, free them from hardship, foe and machinations


and try to do them harm,  granting them grace and favour as well as compassion in His eyes here and  those who see them, amen. I beg God


[Who] is not subject to need, Who cannot be captured by attributes, and Who cannot be encircled by the regions (of the world) to free  them from all hardship and distress,


from affliction and pain, and grant  them no offering from the hands of man that is born of woman, of few days and full of trouble,


keep you from transgression, aversion and anguish, grant them offspring and home for you and for all our Karaite brothers, keep


all of you safe, growing, being fruitful and multiplying and strengthened  forever and ever, amen. May God bless the good and righteous of heart.
