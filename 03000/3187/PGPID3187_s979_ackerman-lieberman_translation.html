                        <ol><li>furnishings for the workshop, and what there is in terms of lead and pellets and earth and potsherds, will all be for the “mi[ddle” (that is, for the common account)]</li><li>of the aforementioned partnership (shirka). Likewise, concerning that which we have in the hands of  “the people”—I recorded it in</li><li>my [no]tebook in my script, and that, too, was part of the partnership account. My partner Abū al-Khayr will collect it.</li><li>[And] a third of the equipment in the foundry (will be) for Abū ‘Alī my brother, and a third for Abū al-Khayr</li><li>my partner. That which he claims from the lease incumbent upon Yāqūt beyond the seven and a quarter</li><li>shall be (split) between me and Abū al-Khayr. We have a [claim] document against Yāqūt for the remainder //therein// of</li><li>eleven din(ars) and a half; half of it, which was earmarked for me, (will be) for Abū ‘Alī my brother </li><li>and half [for A]bū al-Khayr. Abū al-Khayr is entrusted with all that, and he is to be trusted</li><li>as two proper witnesses concerning everything with which he is entrusted. //And as a result of his sickness he died (and went) to his eternal life// Abraham b. Isaac (whose) s(oul is at) r(est)</li><li>Abraham b. Yeshu‘a (may his) e(nd be) g(ood) Zadoq b. Mevorakh, Head of the Congregations, m(ay his) s(oul be) b(ound up in) t(he bond of life)</li><li>Mevorakh b. Joseph ha-Levi (whose) s(oul is at) r(est) We, the undersigned witnesses, accepted</li><li>the will, fixed above, after its having been established in a court,</li><li>word for word, by means of an original document which was admissible. That which took place before us,</li><li>we wrote and signed in order that there would be a title of right and proof. Hanging between the lines: “And as a result </li><li>of this sickness of his he died (and went) to his eternal life”. Confirmed and this is their confirmation.</li></ol>
