                        <h3>Recto </h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>And say to him: All your life - peace upon you, peace upon your house, etc.</li>
<li>The Lord will guard you from all evil, he will guard your soul,</li>
<li>The Lord will guard your going out and coming in, from this time forth and for ever.</li>
<li>To the presence of my brother, the delight of my eyes, my lord and leader, most esteemed by me, the crown of my head, and the one on whom I rely. May God prolong his life in happiness,</li>
<li>guard and keep him and never deprive him of his good guidance. Dear brother, may God protect and never forsake you,</li>
<li>may he be your help and sustainer, your support and trust from this time forth and forever. I entered Sicily with my family coming from Tunis</li>
<li>because of the privations suffered there and the horrors witnessed in &nbsp;Ifrīqiya and also because of my longing for you. I intended</li>
<li>to travel to Egypt via Sicily, for it is not any more possible to travel to Egypt directly from &nbsp;Ifrīqiya.</li>
<li>I planned to arrive in Egypt this very year, but God had willed otherwise.</li>
<li>The obstacle to my travel and coming to you was illness in the family, which lasted four months.</li>
<li>By Israel's religion, my misfortune forced me to spend 50 Murābiṭī dinars, for the wife fell ill</li>
<li>and also the two little ones, and God willed that one of them died, the baby, he was one and a half years old -</li>
<li>may your life be prolonged! Then on the voyage to Sicily I was overcome by a disaster the like of which I have never witnessed.</li>
<li>A great storm seized us on the sea and we were forced to land on an island called Ghumūr . We stayed there for twenty days</li>
<li>with no food other than nettles. When we set out from there we did not have any more the look of</li>
<li>human beings. The seas tormented us for thirty-five days and we were regarded</li>
<li>as lost. For we set sail in four barges (qārib), but only ours survived.</li>
<li>After arrival in Sicily we were so exhausted from our sufferings at sea that we were unable to eat bread or to understand what was said</li>
<li>to us for a full month. This is the reason which prevented me from coming to Egypt this year. After all we have endured</li>
<li>this year we are not prone to travel. You must see us with your own eyes; no description can do justice to our state. Furthermore, it is now three years that I have not seen a letter or an answer</li>
<li>from you. I am very much upset, and this, too, makes me reluctant to come. Dear brother,</li>
<li>by God, do not withhold your letters from me, for I am waiting for them. I am staying here in Sicily, by God, do not withhold</li>
<li>from me your letters&hellip;, for I am yearning after you and my mind is very much perturbed since the time</li>
<li>your letters ceased to come. Write also about the poll tax. If you intend to move, the best thing is to come to</li>
<li>Sicily (or: Palermo), for the spices of the Orient sell here well. Thus, it will be for both pleasure and business. We shall help one another</li>
<li>in enhancing the prestige of the family and shall be happy with one another.</li>
<li>[Goitein's translation skips a few lines]</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>This letter was written</li>
<li>on the New Moon day of the month of Sivan. By God, I need not entreat you again to answer quickly, if God wills.</li>
<li>Peace upon you and God's mercy and his blessings. And your welfare may wax for ever and never decrease, Amen.</li>
<li>My son Abu &rsquo;l-Ḥasan sends greetings to you all, and so does the dweller of my house - to everyone, young and old.</li>
