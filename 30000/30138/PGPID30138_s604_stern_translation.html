<li>. . . One thing I have asked</li>
<li>of the Lord, that will I seek after (Ps. 24:7). Do not turn away the oppressed shamefaced.</li>
<li>I desire you to advise me on what I propose to do&mdash;namely</li>
<li>to eat the amount which you have prescribed, but to diminish it daily</li>
<li>by about a dirham, according to what seems to you beneficial, and</li>
<li>stop with this at a level which you order to me; since my entire aim</li>
<li>in this matter is to get near to Him with all my force (or: spirit). Do not neglect me</li>
<li>regarding what you can do in this matter, for the sake of God, since I have seen in</li>
<li>the book of al-Fawwal that if the stomach is refined. . .</li>
<li>the blood, there rises from it a fine steam which becomes what is called</li>
<li>spirit, and according to the purity of this spirit and the degree of clarity in its organs,</li>
<li>the faculties of the soul arise from it, and it [the soul] is prepared to receive its influences.</li>
<li>Prescribe to me what I should cook if occasion sometimes arises: something</li>
<li>which agrees with this aim, but is not expensive. Judge me leniently</li>
<li>for these words, according to my ignorance. May your peace increase, amen selah.</li>

<li>What is prescribed from the types of nutrition [</li>
