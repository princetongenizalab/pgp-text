Recto

. . . One thing I have asked
of the Lord, that will I seek after (Ps. 24:7). Do not turn away the oppressed shamefaced.
I desire you to advise me on what I propose to do—namely
to eat the amount which you have prescribed, but to diminish it daily
by about a dirham, according to what seems to you beneficial, and
stop with this at a level which you order to me; since my entire aim
in this matter is to get near to Him with all my force (or: spirit). Do not neglect me
regarding what you can do in this matter, for the sake of God, since I have seen in
the book of al-Fawwal that if the stomach is refined. . .
the blood, there rises from it a fine steam which becomes what is called
spirit, and according to the purity of this spirit and the degree of clarity in its organs,
the faculties of the soul arise from it, and it [the soul] is prepared to receive its influences.
Prescribe to me what I should cook if occasion sometimes arises: something
which agrees with this aim, but is not expensive. Judge me leniently
for these words, according to my ignorance. May your peace increase, amen selah.

Verso, second block (ll. 3–5)

What is prescribed from the types of nutrition [
And if that does not work (?), in that case [
with the kernels removed, and the inside of almonds [
the insides of fennel, some of [
what is prepared of it . . . [
