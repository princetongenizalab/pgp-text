In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.


The most lofty and singular lord, the firm,


the confidence, the trustworthy, pride of the viziers and greatness of the kingdom,


nobility of the lofty dynasty, chosen one of the Fatimid


caliphate, crown of the true companions, venerable one of the dynasty


and its loftiness, bearer of the two splendors, companion of the commander


of the believers
