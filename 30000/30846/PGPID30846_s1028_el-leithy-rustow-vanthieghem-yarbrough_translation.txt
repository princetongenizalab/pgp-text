Recto

[ …(if ... at the tim]e when the levying comes at the beginning of the kharāj (cycle, i.e., the fiscal year), the collection is moved forward ... 
[… on]e of the levies of this year, and what might be delayed from the revenue of the various kinds of taxes in their due time. and al[l of the … ]
of the dīwān, permission will not be given to delay one of the levies until the following levy. For by collecting in full
the payment of the installments of the levies on time, the collection of revenue and its cross-checking may be achieved by the end of Misrā (the last month of the fiscal year), with God’s permission 
and volition. 
The collection will happen at the hand of the jahbadh appointed by the dīwān for performing that (function) after he has shown the document (of appointment)
to the head (of the district dīwān), may God prolong his strength. He should supervise and inquire into his situation, and he should not let him have sole authority over
any part of it (the collection). He (the head of the district dīwān) should register (yuthbit) the receipts (barāʾāt) that he has received and sign off on them (yuwaqqiʿ) (notating) their authentication (thubūt) in the dīwān of the district. And let it be known to all of the taxpayers (muʿāmilīn)
in it (the district) that whenever a tax collector (muʿāmil) or a tax-contractor (ḍāmin) gives him some of what they owe without (receiving) a tax receipt (barāʾa) or with an unauthenticated/unregistered tax receipt,
[... (it will be as null and void).]
