If</li><li>the aforementioned Mufaḍḍal wishes to watch out for himself, and that he would se[parate] from his brother Abū al-Faraj in the matter of food and drink, he would take</li><li>from the store two dirhams each day, and his brother Abū al-Faraj would take four dirhams each day, for the duration of this partnership (shirka). Whatever</li><li>exalted God facilitated for the two of them therein beyond the aforementioned support food and as for difficulties with provisions and rent and </li><li>other difficulties that may befall them, they will share that equally. If either of them pursues a change in the profit of the partnership (shirka),</li><li>he will act with trust and avoidance of betrayal, and the supervision of God, praised be He, in everything that he does and with which he is entrusted. We performed a qinyan with both</li><li>the aforementioned Abū al-Faraj and his brother Abū al-Mufaḍḍal, a complete and weighty qinyan, with an item suitable for doing so, with the formula “effective immediately”, in accordance with his will,</li><li>without any compulsion whatsoever, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions, concerning all that which is written and stipulated above. Added between the lines: “It is proper (and) enduring”</li><li>We wrote and signed that which took place before us, in order that there would be a title of right and proof. Everything is proper and clear and enduring.</li><li>Joseph ha-Levi b. Samuel (may the) Merci(ful One) pro(tect him)     Levi ha-Levi b.
