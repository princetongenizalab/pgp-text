                        <ol><li>Testimony which was before us, we the undersigned witnesses, on Tuesday, the fifteenth day of the month of Kislev</li><li>of the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-six years (of the Era) of Documents”, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, which is situated on the Nile River, the jurisdiction</li><li>of our lord, the Nagid [Abra]ham, the outstanding Rav, the mighty hammer, Lamp of the West, Standard of the Sages, Inimitable of the Generation and its Wonder, from east</li><li>of the sun t[o its west, may] his name always be praised, thus: the Elder Abū al-Bahā b. [the Elder] Abū al-Ḥasan al-Dilātī the Beekeeper</li><li>(who) r(ests in) E(den) came before us [... and said to us, “Te]stify on my behalf and perform a qinyan with me, effective immediately, write and sign [on] my behalf, with the most [certain] and perfect [expression]s for claims</li><li>[and give it to] M(r.) Moses ha-Kohen, nephew of the Elder Abū al-Baqā b. [the Elder Abū al-Ḥasan the bee]keeper al-Dilātī (who) r(ests in) E(den), in order that [he would have]</li><li>[in his hand] certain [p]roof and a precautionary release from today onward, that I attest before you in clear eloquent testimony that</li><li>[……….] before my nephew, the aforementioned Mr. Moses ha-Kohen, that I have no right, nor any legal claim nor demand upon him, and all claims I have pursued</li><li>before him today, upon the aforementioned Mr. Moses ha-Kohen, my nephew, have no significance, since I have forgiven him</li><li>concerning all claims which I could direct against him concerning all of the financial transactions (mu‘āmalāt) which were between us from the beginning of time until </li><li>now, and no right of any sort remains for me before him, nor any claim of any sort, nor any [sort of]</li><li>demand, since I have released him before you from all that and from all the types of [vows and oaths]</li><li>and rider oaths, and even from ḥerem setam, and from all that which I could direct against the assets of [my] ne[phew. A]</li><li>ban [has been enacted] concerning all claims which I have made therein from the beginning of time until now, concerning all the financial [transactions (mu‘āmalāt)  which were]</li><li>between us, up to the date of this decree, and the extent of claims in which he was obligated to me has ended […]</li><li>an appraisal of (partnership) assets or a vow or a rider oath attached to another oath, or the stopping of a ban, and even ḥerem setam […]</li><li>that up to a thousand Fusṭāṭ dinars, I have released him from all that in a complete, definitive, certain, conc[lusive] release, [effective immediately]</li><li>from me—I, the aforementioned Abū al-Bahā, and from my heirs after me, to Mr. Moses ha-Kohen, and to [his] he[irs]</li><li>after him, a release severing all other claims and demands with respect to (any) disputes </li><li>and legal judgments, loosening the bonds of each joint enterprise (mu‘āmala). Confirm what was between us from the beginning </li><li>of time up till now, and all testimony—oral or written—or claim coming to me, from my hand or fr[om]</li><li>any of my heirs after me //from that which would nullify this release or would weaken something within it// I have already nullified all that, effective immediately, and I have declared sucn an entire ruling</li><li>worthless, as an ordinary potsherd, lacking any (legal) substance. I [have written] this release on my own behalf—I, the aforementioned Abū [al-Bahā]</li><li>in order that it would be a release from me and from my heirs after me, for my nephew Mr. Moses ha-Kohen, and for his he[irs] after him,</li><li>a release which is correct, fixed, enduring in all that is explained above in this dec[ree, with no] flawed [detail] </li><li>therein, nor (anything) nullifying its judgment, nor a reason requiring its nullification, since its judgment is neither as an or[al trad]ition </li><li>…. nor as the written pages of (legal) sources, rather as the most certain, weightest, most certain and sharpest of decrees</li><li>[for testi]mony in …[..] ever to pass through a quill, upon him; and the judgments therein in all of the first </li><li>[…..] ….. […Ha]nging between the lines, [“…] the bonds which would nullify this release or weaken”</li><li>[...] …. Written [on] an erasure: “…” Confirmed, and this is [their confirmation:] We wrote and signed this testimony after</li><li>we performed a qinyan with Mr. Moses ha-Kohen in a co[mplete] and weighty [qinyan], with an item suitable for doing so, effective immediately,</li><li>in accordance with his intention, without any duress whatsoever, nullifying any secret dispositions and secret dispositions concerning secret dispositions and secret dispositions that may develop from secret dispositions forevermore, and all</li><li>conditions, concerning all that which is written and specified above. We wrote this document for this M(r.) Moses ha-Kohen</li><li>in order that he would have in his hand a title of right and proof from this day forward. Everything is proper, clear and enduring.</li></ol>
