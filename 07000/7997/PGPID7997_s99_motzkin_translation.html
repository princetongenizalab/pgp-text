                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>I am a companion to all who fear Thee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the dignity, honor, greatness and holiness of our master and teacher David ha-Kohen, the exalted H'a've'r,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wise and understanding, (may his) Ro(ck) prese(r v e ) him; from Elijah , son of R . Zechariah [m(ay his) s(oul be) b(ound) in (the bundle of) the (living)] who loves him as he does himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I inform you of my great longing for you and of my having been</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quiet occupied. This limited my determination and my ability to fulfill my duty toward the like of you,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>especially as I do not cease thinking about it for several reasons. May God, then,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>help you in religious as well as worldly affairs for His sake. And may the merit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of your father (the virtuous and honorable master, who fulfills (the commandments) and knows them well) intercede for you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as well as for us. May your blessings not cease for us. Your house is the beauty of the community,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God give you success so that He, the exalted, may be satisfied with it, and may He also give us success for the sake of His name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We inform you, may your strength not cease, that a young woman - her name is Bushr - a daughter of Asad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>son of al-Sali'ar, the auctioneer in the bazaar of the wool-merchants, came with her mother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nasab, daughter of Abu'I-Mans'u'r, to court, in order to marry her daughter,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the one named Bushr - a young woman who is of age - to a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cairene. We then inquired about her and asked a man of her people who knows her - - -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu' al-'Ala" son of al-Nusha'diri', the silk merchant — and they said</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that this young woman - being of age - was engaged to a young man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could not establish anything certain about their case, and what happened to them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from which it could become clear that a connection between them no longer exists and which would therefore remove any doubt in the matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our lord, therefore, may his glory be exalted, ordered that we write to our patron</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a letter in which we would inform him of the matter, so that he would write us an unequivocal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>letter about their affair - quickly, for her mother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentioned that she appeared before your late father of blessed memory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and it was in your presence and in the presence of the revered colleague R. Solomon, (may his) Ro(ck) prese(rve) him,</p>
</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Recto Margin</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>and a group (of people)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and they made a settlement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the person who was engaged</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the young woman about eight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>months ago and that they released</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each other from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any right which may attach them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to each other. Be so kind then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to hurry and summon to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this Jacob</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and establish from him that he had released</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his above mentioned fiancéé</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and her mother; we have already established from the young woman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that she had released him.</p>
</li>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>from any right which may connect him to her, and any other condition,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and further, that she disliked his company, and that he mentioned in your presence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that he disliked her and that he was unable to support her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[This was also] in the presence of the Sheikh Aaron and in the presence of . . . . and that they separated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by their ritual releases, and they then split off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We likewise established from her mother that she</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had released him and had absolved him. Now if these things are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remembered by you, then you can dispense with making the above mentioned Jacob appear before you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and with getting testimony about it again after their having made a settlement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in your presence. So please make all effort that he appear before you under all circumstances if the matter is as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>has been described, so that you may reply quickly. After (all this I write) special greetings,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>best of regards and greetings, and respect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to all our brethern, the wise and dear H'ave'ri'm -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God give them success - and to Sheikh Khalaf the Kohen, your brother (God protect him)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and to your children - best regards - and to the Sheikh R. Joseph</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>               and his loving son Solomon, may he arrive [soon]</p>
