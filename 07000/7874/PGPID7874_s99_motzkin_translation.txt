Recto


I greet the dignity of the august patron, the great scholar, the honor and holiness of our master and teacher Elijah, the dear prince,


the wide and understanding, on the occasion of this noble month, the month of E'ta'ni'm. May you be written in the book of life, the book of


remembrance, and may you get glad tidings - on the tenth - of forgiveness and pardon. I inform you of my departure with


my son to al-Mah'alla. I offered for sale the lacquer for which one could not get even a dirhem. They said,


this is of poor quality; I brought it down with me to Damietta where Ibn'Atiyya Bu' Ali' Ibn al-Kaghadhi' was present.


He saw it and said, "it is affected by crumbling." I didn’t stop imploring him (for this) and asking him (to buy) until


he bought it from me for the same price which he paid Ibn 'Atiyya: 600 dirhems per qinta'r.


I sold him 300 dirhems worth of it. I sent to your dignity seven and a third gold (di'na'rs) and one silver (dirhem),


for he had sent some silk with me which I sold him in al-Mahalla. I have paid it to you and to Ibn 'Atiyya.


God knows that I was afraid to sell it for you for ten di'na'rs.


After I will send (the money) to you from Damietta I hope you will send me some better (lacquer).


Be so kind and greet my patrons, your children, for me - and whomever else you care about. May your peace


increase forever and ever selah. Written in haste on the third of Tis're'. Your servant


                                          Tobiah.
