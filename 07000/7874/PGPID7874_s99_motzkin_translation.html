<li>
<p>I greet the dignity of the august patron, the great scholar, the honor and holiness of our master and teacher Elijah, the dear prince,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wide and understanding, on the occasion of this noble month, the month of E'ta'ni'm. May you be written in the book of life, the book of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remembrance, and may you get glad tidings - on the tenth - of forgiveness and pardon. I inform you of my departure with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my son to al-Mah'alla. I offered for sale the lacquer for which one could not get even a dirhem. They said,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is of poor quality; I brought it down with me to Damietta where Ibn'Atiyya Bu' Ali' Ibn al-Kaghadhi' was present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He saw it and said, "it is affected by crumbling." I didn’t stop imploring him (for this) and asking him (to buy) until</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he bought it from me for the same price which he paid Ibn 'Atiyya: 600 dirhems per qinta'r.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sold him 300 dirhems worth of it. I sent to your dignity seven and a third gold (di'na'rs) and one silver (dirhem),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for he had sent some silk with me which I sold him in al-Mahalla. I have paid it to you and to Ibn 'Atiyya.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God knows that I was afraid to sell it for you for ten di'na'rs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I will send (the money) to you from Damietta I hope you will send me some better (lacquer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be so kind and greet my patrons, your children, for me - and whomever else you care about. May your peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase forever and ever selah. Written in haste on the third of Tis're'. Your servant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                                          Tobiah.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The city of Cairo, to the storehouse of the Faqi'h, Bu' Mansu'r. To the elder Abu'l-Faraj b. Zikri, son of the chief,</p>
</li>
