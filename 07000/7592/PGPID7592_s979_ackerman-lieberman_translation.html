                        <ol><li>In (Your) na(me,) O Mer(ciful One.)</li><li>The witnesses whose names are specified in this report testified that </li><li>Ya‘qūb b. Joseph and Dā’ūd and Ṣedaqa, sons of Ṣemaḥ b. Dā’ūd al-Raqqī personally …</li><li>and their names and their family-names; Ya‘qūb b. Joseph brought them on Monday on the eighth</li><li>of the month of Ramaḍān, that they would record and testify to all that which proceeded between him and between Dā’ūd and Ṣedaqa</li><li>these brothers, the sons of Ṣemaḥ, as a partnership (shirka) between them, for a dispute broke out between them, </li><li>and when these brothers, Dā’ūd and Ṣemaḥ, appeared at the appearance of witnesses, this Ya‘qūb </li><li>b. Joseph began and said to them, “Know that I have not called you today to these (people) to a court judgment</li><li>but rather I have called you to testify. So testify to that which proceeded between us in terms of oral statements</li><li>and admissions, and record that for us, from the oral statements that we are acting deliberately and intentionally </li><li>in accordance with the first (thing) that Ya‘qūb said to these two brothers, Dā’ūd and Ṣedaqa, ‘I will swear </li><li>before you, by God, great and mighty, and by His Torah, and by all Israel, concerning all</li><li>your questions, if you correctly report that which God, great and mighty, knows, with neither falsehood nor</li><li>concealment nor fear nor bias, since it would not help you with me, for I am not lost to</li><li>your judgment after today.’” Then the oath was repeated for them … then he returned</li><li>and the brothers responded together, saying, “Yes, we accept the oath upon ourselves. We</li><li>are only speaking the truth and the facts which God, great and mighty, knows.” Then he (Ya‘qūb) said, “Was it not </li><li>before your (re)payment of that which I paid to the merchants, which I found with you!” The two of them said,</li><li>“Yes.” Then he said to them, “Did you have the profit, (my) dear, to which I am entitled, because</li><li>I am concerned.” They said, “No, we don’t have anything of yours, (my) dear.” But indeed I found (something)</li><li>for myself (therein). Then I pressed upon Ṣedaqa, the younger brother, and said to him, “Before</li><li>your brother’s arrival, when you came from the road and you presented your alibi, did I take </li><li>something from you or (even) demand from you something or (even) a promise, (my) dear?” Ṣedaqa said, “No.” “Then, by God, testify</li><li>about him concerning all that he said.” Then he said to Bishr, “When you showed up, something (that is, a business arrangement) proceeded between you and me</li><li>as we mentioned.” And he responded, saying, “As God is my witness, I never heard from you even on a single day—</li><li>not before, not after—concerning this situation.” //And he said, “No.”// Then he said to both the brothers, “Are you not</li><li>with … I sold the merchandise with which I was involved, ‘eating of the (Paschal sacrifice)’?” </li><li>… for it, a final sale, not completing the total, and I spent the funds upon myself in […]</li><li>… since … he did not … me the way of …spent for the business. I assigned</li><li>such (and such) your business, and I did not wish to take any of the merchandise upon myself.” The two of them said, “Yes,” acknowledging </li><li>before you all that which I said. Then he said to them, “Have I not opened the store for you, by the eye</li><li>of great and mighty God?” I said to you, “I owe you nothing further. Ask me for my maintenance, but beyond that,</li><li>I will not use my high position for any sort of help that you that you might need.” You said,</li><li>“We don’t have (the money for the re-)payment, nor (can) we complete anything without your sitting (and working) with us.” And indeed, you harassed me</li><li>until I granted your wish and sat with you as a partner, such that I (would receive) half of (what) we (received), may God give us success, and the two of you (would receive) </li><li>the (other) half.” Then he said to them, “After a month elapsed, did I not see that your situation was good, (yet) </li><li>I was not compensated. So I gathered before you all the Elders and we wrote a detailed description between us. We testified</li><li>to all the stipulations which were in that description. And indeed, that (very) night you invalidated it with your statement—</li><li>you, O Ṣedaqa! If you did not want the produce and the keys, then I will work in (times of) trouble and pestilience</li><li>for myself (and not for the partnership)—though I wanted you to have the keys and the produce.’” And the two of them said, “Yes.” Then he said to them, </li><li>“Concerning what I did during whole period in terms of buying and selling—does it go into the</li><li>big and small scale, or do I receive food as payment or a measure of produce to be taken to the money-changer, or also </li><li>… or an error happened between us and between the money-changer and a business agent and an agent in the payment or a fraction of it.</li><li>The two of them said, “No.” Then he said, “Concerning that which we purchased and sold from the first day (of the partnership), did we sell comething</li><li>at a loss?” He said, “No—rather, we did so for a profit.” Then he said to them, “Did I take some of the profit from the store </li><li>other than ten dina(rs) in addition to whatever was established in the detailed description—which was (itself) a (single) din(ar)? They took it each </li><li>Friday and divided it—half for me and half for you—for a period of 15 months.” And he said, “Further,</li><li>other than that which I mentioned—that is the ten din(ars) and a half—the rest of the profit of the store is for you </li><li>each Friday.” Then he said to them, “Tell me that there is a going concern in the store with what I paid—four thousand din(ars)! </li><li>How can one not suggest that there will be an equivalent amount of profit! I would like the rest of the profit, and that</li><li>which I claimed from you (in) this joint enterprise (mu‘āmala) for safekeeping.’” The two of them responded and said, “O assembly of </li><li>Elders, a store from which thirty din(ars) comes every month for our debts, may he claim profits</li><li>more than this amount therefrom since he is this Ya‘qūb?” The witnesses present said, “Record concerning them and preserve (this)</li><li>testimony, with all the decisions in //that which// I examined them. Testify to me therein in your presence, and record </li><li>the testimony. When he demanded the testimony from us, we testified and gave it to him as a valid proof from today onward.</li><li>Mubashir b. Fahīd (who) r(ests in) E(den)     Maṣliaḥ b.
