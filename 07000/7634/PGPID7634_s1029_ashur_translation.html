                        <p>Mr. ʿIwāḍ, from Alexandria, son of Manasseh the elder, may he rest in&nbsp; Eden, came to the court and brought with him a legal deed [shetar] written by Zedaqa Halevi the cantor, may God protect him, known as the son&nbsp; of Nufayʿ, in which he [ʿIwāḍ] affirmed that he had divorced his wife&nbsp; Hilāla, daughter of Joshua, by a proxy [wakil] whom she had sent, and that he released her from anything he owes her, and he is guarantor for her regarding this matter. And the court asked him to bring witnesses [shuhud] to support his story, and he brought two witnesses: Shabbat b. Maḥfuz al-Banā and Abu al-Khayr, both from Alexandria. And they both testify that they both recognize the signatures of the witnesses that are signed on the deed [shetar], and that they were both present in Alexandria at the time the aforementioned Hilāla received the bill of divorce [get] which had been written for her, from her husband, the aforementioned ʿIwāḍ. After the court approved all of the above, he [ʿIwāḍ] asked to marry [jīza] in Fustat. Then we joined him [and went to the house of&nbsp; the prospective bride] and he engaged Sitt al-Khuwāt, daughter of Elijah, may he rest in Eden, the divorc&eacute;e of Judah Halevi, son of Manasseh, may he rest in Eden, in our presence after we had examined her bill of&nbsp; divorce, which is dated to the 11th of Av 1442 Era of Documents [8 July 1131], and it was also approved by us. And they both agree that the advance payment [muqdam] &nbsp;[to the bride] will be four dinars, as a gift from the time of the wedding, of which he [now] brought two dinars, which were given to Yiḥya Halevi, son of Abraham, her sister&rsquo;s husband,&nbsp; [in trust] for her, together with a silver ring, in a capacity of deposit [&lsquo;alā sabīl al-wadī&rsquo;a]. And regarding the two remaining dinars, it was agreed&nbsp; that he shall give them to her at the time of marriage. And the delayed payment [muakhkhar] is twelve dinars, good, excellent. And the marriage was set to take place on the month of Sivan of this year. The fianc&eacute; undertook to pay her, in the event that he cancels the marriage, four dinars, as a gift. And [he also undertook] that they will live in Fustat. He&nbsp; also stipulated that whenever he should ask her to accompany him and visit his family she will not prevent it, as long as he will return her to Fustat. And Yiḥya, her sister&rsquo;s husband, guaranteed on her behalf that if&nbsp; she will ask to cancel the marriage, he shall pay four dinars as a present to the fianc&eacute;. We performed a qinyan [a legally binding act] between the&nbsp; fianc&eacute; and the aforementioned Yiḥya, with respect to each and every one&nbsp; of the things ascribed above,&nbsp; a complete qinyan with a valid legal instrument fit for doing so, effective immediately, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions. And we wrote and signed it concerning what was&nbsp; performed before us so that it will stand as a title of rights and as proof.&nbsp; All of this took place on Tuesday, twenty-fifth of Nisan, 1443 Era of Documents [12 April 1132], in Fustat, Egypt, situated on the river Nile under&nbsp; the jurisdiction of our Master Maṣliaḥ Hakohen, the Head of the Yeshivah of Ge&rsquo;on Yaʿakov, may his position be established forever. Strong, firm and valid.[Signatures] Nathan Hakohen b. Solomon Hakohen, may&nbsp; he rest in Eden. Ḥalfon Halevi b. Mannase, may he rest in Eden. ʿIwāḍ b.&nbsp; Zedaqa, may his end be good.&nbsp;</p>
