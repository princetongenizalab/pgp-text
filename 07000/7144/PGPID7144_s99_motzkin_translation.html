<li>
<p>and favor - He has mastery over it, God willing. I inform you of my great</p>

<li>                    ] the blessed news</li>
<li>
<p>                    ] may not make us fall into the hands of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                ] the great. I ask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your grace to send ] us a letter in which you would really admonish her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                ] not from you a salutary letter which will come</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                ] since we left you, you have not written</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                ] be so kind as to let us know in your letter all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                ] upon it. Enjoin her to accept</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                ] her things but she disobeys everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                 ] be so kind as to enjoin her, for she is - as God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is true - your daugh]ter, and I am your brother or son or servant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                ] me girl. She accepts nothing; nay, all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                   ] man order her, she will disobey them. And that is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> . . . . . . . . . . It isn't that I hate her; I only hate her character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I say to her, "don't do this!" Says she "all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>right, I won't." But then she forgets (what I said) and does it. I do hope God</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will reform her and her blessed character and her blessed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>movements. We hope to God you can change them for the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By God, oh my cousin! If I were only living with you in the same town -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would never leave you, and you would make peace between us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God let me live to see that day! - And make her live, (too), and make her fortunate, and bless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her life. May he never separate us and grant her as a boon;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May he bring us together. Amen. Peace.</p>

<p>Written on the seventh of Ni’sa’n, may salvation come soon.</p>
