<li>    son of ‘so and so’, and all the names and nicknames that I have, do desire of my own</li>
<li>    free will, without coercion, to divorce, to release, to let go</li>
<li>    you, ‘so and so’ daughter of ‘so and so’, and all the names and nicknames that you</li>
<li>    have, who have until now been my wife. Now that I divorce </li>
<li>    you, you have the licence and power over yourself </li>
<li>    to be married to any man that you wish, and no-one will interfere </li>
<li>  on my account, from this day forth and forever, and behold you are</li>
<li>  [hereby] permitted to any man, and this will serve for you as </li>
<li>  a document of divorce, and a bill of release and a letter of leaving.</li>
