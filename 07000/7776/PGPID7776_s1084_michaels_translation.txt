Recto

   On the second day of the week [i.e. Monday], which is the twentieth day of the month of ʾElul of the year
  one thousand, four hundred and ninety-two years according to the (Era of) Documents, 
   in Fusṭāṭ, Egypt, which is situated on the river Nile [Nilus], I , ‘so and so’ 
    son of ‘so and so’, and all the names and nicknames that I have, do desire of my own
    free will, without coercion, to divorce, to release, to let go
    you, ‘so and so’ daughter of ‘so and so’, and all the names and nicknames that you
    have, who have until now been my wife. Now that I divorce 
    you, you have the licence and power over yourself 
    to be married to any man that you wish, and no-one will interfere 
  on my account, from this day forth and forever, and behold you are
  [hereby] permitted to any man, and this will serve for you as 
  a document of divorce, and a bill of release and a letter of leaving.
