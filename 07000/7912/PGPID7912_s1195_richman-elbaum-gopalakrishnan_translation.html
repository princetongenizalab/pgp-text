<li>
<p>What do the sages of Israel, may their glory be exalted and their honor increased, say</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in regard to the case of Reuben and Shimon, who collectively hold property. Reuben has three-quarters of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Shimon has the other quarter. And that is the whole dār, so </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he asked Shimon to sell him the quarter he owns or to buy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from him the three-quarters. Simon refused to buy </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or sell. Does the law require this of him,or not? And does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the law require either of them to (be able to) coerce the other in this, or not? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May they teach us, and may their reward be doubled from heaven.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Answer</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The law permits either of them to tell the other “"either you extend (possession over the whole property)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> or I extend (possession)" the true meaning of which is “you compel or I compel.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is an Aramaic expression, as the Targum of “mishkhu et” is “negidu”, meaning </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You buy my share for what is is worth, which is such and such, or sell (it to) me so I can buy </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your share for what it is worth, which is such and such.” His partner cannot refuse this, he </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>must either buy from him or sell (his share)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He cannot protest, “But I am poor and don’t have anything to buy it with, and I don’t want to sell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my property.” This is not accepted from him. Rather, we compel him </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>either to buy or to sell. This is the opinion of our teacher Yiṣḥaq [al-Fasī], (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master of the Halakhot in the first (chapter of Bava) Batra and likewise, the word of our teacher the rav</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the great Moshe, (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing) in Hilkhot Shekhenim, and this is the law,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and one must not change it. Written by Shelomo b. Yishai ha-Nasī, (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This legal opinion is proper, and I stand by it: Peraḥya b. Yosef,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>m(ay his) s(oul) be bound up in t(he bundle of) l(ife)</p>
</li>
