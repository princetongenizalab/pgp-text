<li>
<p>What do the <i>sages of Israel, may their glory be exalted and their honor increased</i>, say</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in regard to the case of Reuben and Shimon, who collectively hold property. Reuben has three-quarters of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Shimon has the other quarter. And that is the whole dār (i.e. there are no other owners). Reuben</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asked Shimon to sell him the quarter he owns or to buy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the three-quarters from him. Simon refused to buy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or sell. Does the law require this of him, or not? And does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the law require either of them to (be able to) coerce the other in this, or not?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>May they teach us, and may their reward be doubled from heaven</i>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Answer</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The law permits either of them to tell the other "<i>either you extend (possession over the whole property)</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>&nbsp;or I extend (possession)</i>" the true meaning of which is &ldquo;<i>you compel or I compel.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is an Aramaic expression, as the Targum of &ldquo;<i>mishkhu et</i>&rdquo; is &ldquo;<i>negidu</i>&rdquo;, meaning&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You buy my share for what is is worth, which is such and such, or sell (it to) me so I can buy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your share for what it is worth, which is such and such.&rdquo; His partner cannot refuse this, he&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>must either buy from him or sell (his share).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He cannot protest, &ldquo;But I am poor and don&rsquo;t have anything to buy it with, and I don&rsquo;t want to sell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my property.&rdquo; This is not accepted from him. Rather, we compel him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>either to buy or to sell. This is the opinion of <i>our teacher</i> Yiṣḥaq [al-Fasī],<i> (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing),</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>Master of the Halakhot</i> in the first (chapter of<i> Bava</i>)<i> Batra</i> and likewise, the word of <i>our teacher the rav</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>the great Moshe, (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing) in Hilkhot Shekhenim</i>, and this is the <i>law,</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>and one must not change it</i>. Written by Shelomo b. Yishai ha-Nasī, <i>(may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing).</i></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This legal opinion is proper, and I stand by it: Peraḥya b. Yosef,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><i>m(ay his) s(oul) be bound up in t(he bundle of) l(ife)</i></p>
</li>
