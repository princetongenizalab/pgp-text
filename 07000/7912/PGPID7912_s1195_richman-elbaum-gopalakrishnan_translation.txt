What do the sages of Israel, may their glory be exalted and their honor increased, say


in regard to the case of Reuben and Shimon, who collectively hold property. Reuben has three-quarters of it


and Shimon has the other quarter. And that is the whole dār (i.e. there are no other owners). Reuben


asked Shimon to sell him the quarter he owns or to buy


from him the three-quarters. Simon refused to buy 


or sell. Does the law require this of him, or not? And does


the law require either of them to (be able to) coerce the other in this, or not? 


May they teach us, and may their reward be doubled from heaven.


 
The Answer


The law permits either of them to tell the other "either you extend (possession over the whole property)


 or I extend (possession)" the true meaning of which is “you compel or I compel.”


This is an Aramaic expression, as the Targum of “mishkhu et” is “negidu”, meaning 


“You buy my share for what is is worth, which is such and such, or sell (it to) me so I can buy 


your share for what it is worth, which is such and such.” His partner cannot refuse this, he 


must either buy from him or sell (his share).


He cannot protest, “But I am poor and don’t have anything to buy it with, and I don’t want to sell


my property.” This is not accepted from him. Rather, we compel him 


either to buy or to sell. This is the opinion of our teacher Yiṣḥaq [al-Fasī], (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing),


Master of the Halakhot in the first (chapter of Bava) Batra and likewise, the word of our teacher the rav


the great Moshe, (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing) in Hilkhot Shekhenim, and this is the law,


and one must not change it. Written by Shelomo b. Yishai ha-Nasī, (may his) h(oly) m(emory) b(e a blessing).


This legal opinion is proper, and I stand by it: Peraḥya b. Yosef,


m(ay his) s(oul) be bound up in t(he bundle of) l(ife)
