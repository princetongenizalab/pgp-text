Ibrāhīm b. Bū l-Faḍl, may his end be good,
and Bū l-Ḥasan b. Bū l-ʿAlāʾ, may his end be good, both appeared in court. 
The aforementioned Ibrāhīm put down
three and one-half Egyptian dinars,
and the aforementioned Bū l-Ḥasan put down one and one-half dinars,
and the two sums were intermingled. It was acknowledged that
Abū l-Ḥasan would supplement his contribution until it reached a full three and one-half dinars
so that the two investments would be of equal value.
We made the symbolic purchase from them
in a valid manner, to be in effect immediately, and they prayed for guidance from
the Creator may He be praised. The two parties will work in
the craft of goldsmithing, and they will sell (their products).
Whatever profit they make
is to be shared between them equally in half.
Likewise, if they encounter a setback
in the work in which they will be engaged,
that too is to be borne between them equally.
