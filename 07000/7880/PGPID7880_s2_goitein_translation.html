<li>Ibrāhīm b. Bū l-Faḍl, may his end be good,</li>
<li>and Bū l-Ḥasan b. Bū l-ʿAlāʾ, may his end be good, both appeared in court.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The aforementioned Ibrāhīm put down</li>
<li>three and one-half Egyptian dinars,</li>
<li>and the aforementioned Bū l-Ḥasan put down one and one-half dinars,</li>
<li>and the two sums were intermingled. It was acknowledged that</li>
<li>Abū l-Ḥasan would supplement his contribution until it reached a full three and one-half dinars</li>
<li>so that the two investments would be of equal value.</li>
<li>We made the symbolic purchase from them</li>
<li>in a valid manner, to be in effect immediately, and they prayed for guidance from</li>
<li>the Creator may He be praised. The two parties will work in</li>
<li>the craft of goldsmithing, and they will sell (their products).</li>
<li>Whatever profit they make</li>
<li>is to be shared between them equally in half.</li>
<li>Likewise, if they encounter a setback</li>
<li>in the work in which they will be engaged,</li>
<li>that too is to be borne between them equally.</li>
