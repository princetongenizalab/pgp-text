<p>When there appeared before us, we the undersigned, [ &nbsp; son of &nbsp; ], (may he) r(est in) E(den), and [his] wif[e] wh[o&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is now married to [him &nbsp; ], Bat Shabbetay, (may his) e(nd be) good, [&nbsp; ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That he would act with [&nbsp; &nbsp; ] and not harm h[er</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he would go with [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ] Israel [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ] with the daughte[rs&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;he assaulted [ &nbsp; &nbsp; ] exalted [ &nbsp; &nbsp; ] from him in the court, the court had a meeting (with him)</p>

<li>
<p>about that, as is required of it; and (as for) him, he imposed upon her an obligation as well, that she should not come or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>go (from their house) except upon his command, and that she should improve her relations with him in accordance with what is required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of others like her among the daughters of Israel with their husbands. And we performed a qinyan with him and with her,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after each of them confirmed to the other the validity of the information and that which was attributed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him regarding that, a complete and stringent qinyan, with an implement suitable for doing [so, (making it valid) fr]om now on, nullifying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any secret dispositions or c[ondition]s. And we wrote and signed (it) to be for both of them as a title of rights and proof.</p>

<p>his position be for eternity, (and this document is) strong and valid. And he obligated upon himself, this M(r.) Ṣedaqa, as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a part of his qinyan, that neither his mother nor his sister nor anyone of his family (shall have the right)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(17 - 18) to intrude upon his wife, and none of them can harass her or harm her, and that he will not raise a hand to hit her, nor desert (her), nor hide</p>

<p>in concealment (as if) deserting (her). And we wrote and signed (it) to be a title and proof, (a document) strong and valid.</p>
