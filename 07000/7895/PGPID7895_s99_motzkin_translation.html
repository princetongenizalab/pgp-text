                        <h3>Recto</h3>

<li>God is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear, etc. the one indebted to you, Solomon son of R. El[ijah].</li>
<li>
<p>The reason which prompted the sending of this paper to my dear brother, –-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the distinguished elder, Abu'l-Faraj, The Glory of the House of the Exilarch, may God perpetuate his honored position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and establish his prosperity, and may we be united with your pleasant countenance - God on high be willing ---</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is my great longing for you. I have sent to you one letter through Isma''i'l</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and one letter through another person, but have received no reply. There have arrived</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>many Alexandrians, not one of them bearing a letter. So I have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>become worried for you, and thought you might be ill. For we did not think that you have been hindered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from [writing] us save by a compelling reason. Also, before this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there came a woman - and I don't know who she is, except that Sitt Ghaza'l knew her; she sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with her a letter to take care of my aunt Umm Abu'l-'Izz</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>because she traveled to your place. Also, when she left, she promised her daughter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to write her a letter so that she be assuaged, and so that we be assuaged about her well-being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and her safe arrival there. I have, therefore, been quite astonished about this thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God, then, calm our hearts by letting us hear about you that you are well,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as are your dear relatives. Your daughter is quite well and lacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nothing, save being able to gaze upon you, and save your not forgetting to inquire about her in your dear letters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>       ] all. I ask, since you are so kind, that you take good care (of that woman) whom God commands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>us to honor, and do not be remiss with her. We know how virtuous you are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and how much you care for her. May you be amply rewarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace be upon you, your wife, your dear brother and his wife and children, your father</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                perfect peace, sublime goals, and honor.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Forgive me this [</p>

<p>since I was in a hurry.</p>

<p>Thank you for</p>

<p>that. Peace</p>
