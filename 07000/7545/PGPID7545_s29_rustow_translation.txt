T-S 20.145

what
I am explaining a bit of what
our lord, the head of the yeshiva, may God
shelter him in the refuge of His wings—explained in his letter concerning
what his condition has come to and that
he is still suffering and he has no place of refuge other than God
the exalted. I have written to his excellency the nagid,
may his reign last forever, and I asked that when
the government fleet sets out, he ask its captain to
rescue our lord the gaʾon, may he find the protection of heaven,
and to rescue his children from Tripoli, if it is possible
for him to embark. I would like his excellency our teacher
the Third, may you be exalted forever, when you appear
before his excellency our lord the nagid—prince of the people of God,
prince of princes, glory of the house of Israel, standard
of the scholars, light of the West, Mordechai of the age,
head of the ranks of Israel, diadem of virtue,
crown of the dispersion, chariot of Israel and its horsemen,
may our Lord make his days eternal and his years and rule
like the days of heaven over the earth—to discuss
this matter and to remind him about it in
[       ], because he is very preoccupied

T-S AS 153.176

may God unite all [        ]
happiness. I have written to his excellency
our great prince, our cousin, prince of the house
of Israel, glory of the priesthood, may
the protector of the souls of His pious ones protect him, on this matter

T-S AS 153.177
T-S 18J5.3
"They took it and traveled with it... toward the beginning of Shabbat Vayoshaʿ (=Beshalaḥ?), the day that Ibn ʿAmmār traveled for Beirut—let him return no more to his house, and let not his place know him any more (Job 7:10)—and then traveled for Tiberias (? טברי) to fortify himself there, and the city is now in the hand of his cousin (ibn ʿamm) Abū l-Manāqib." In the bottom section (note that there is still a gap between T-S AS 153.177 and T-S 18J5.3), refers to "in this crisis and others..."; the sender says that he has already explained the condition of the 'brother' Abū l-Faḍl and his family in other letters; he reiterates greetings to the addressee and his two sons; and his own two sons, ʿAzaryahu and Maṣliaḥ, convey their greetings. Ends with a motto that might be reconstructible as [yu]ḥash [yeshaʿ] be-qarov (יוחש ישע בקרוב).
