                        <p>"They took it and traveled with it... toward the beginning of Shabbat Vayoshaʿ (=Beshalaḥ?), the day that Ibn ʿAmmār traveled for Beirut—let him return no more to his house, and let not his place know him any more (Job 7:10)—and then traveled for Tiberias (? טברי) to fortify himself there, and the city is now in the hand of his cousin (ibn ʿamm) Abū l-Manāqib." In the bottom section (note that there is still a gap between T-S AS 153.177 and T-S 18J5.3), refers to "in this crisis and others..."; the sender says that he has already explained the condition of the 'brother' Abū l-Faḍl and his family in other letters; he reiterates greetings to the addressee and his two sons; and his own two sons, ʿAzaryahu and Maṣliaḥ, convey their greetings. Ends with a motto that might be reconstructible as [yu]ḥash [yeshaʿ] be-qarov (יוחש ישע בקרוב). </p>
