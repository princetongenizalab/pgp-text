<li>what</li>
<li>. . . . . . . . . I am explaining a bit of what</li>
<li>our lord, the head of the yeshiva, may God</li>
<li>shelter him in the refuge of His wings&mdash;explained in his letter concerning</li>
<li>what his condition has come to&nbsp;and that</li>
<li>he is still suffering and he has no place of refuge other than God</li>
<li>the exalted. I have written to his excellency the nagid,</li>
<li>may his reign last forever, and I asked that when</li>
<li>the government fleet sets out, he ask its captain to</li>
<li>rescue our lord the gaʾon, may he find the protection of heaven,</li>
<li>and to rescue his children from Tripoli, if it is possible</li>
<li>for him to embark. I would like his excellency our teacher</li>
<li>the Third, may you be exalted forever, when you appear</li>
<li>before his excellency our lord the nagid&mdash;prince of the people of God,</li>
<li>prince of princes, glory of the house of Israel, standard</li>
<li>of the scholars, light of the West, Mordechai of the age,</li>
<li>head of the ranks of Israel, diadem of virtue,</li>
<li>crown of the dispersion, chariot of Israel and its horsemen,</li>
<li>may our Lord make his days eternal and his years and rule</li>
<li>like the days of heaven over the earth&mdash;to discuss</li>
<li>this matter and to remind him about it in</li>
<li>[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;], because he is very preoccupied</li>

<li>may God unite all [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ]</li>
<li>happiness. I have written to his excellency</li>
<li>our great prince, our cousin, prince of the house</li>
<li>of Israel, glory of the priesthood, may</li>
<li>the protector of the souls of His pious ones protect him, on this matter</li>

<li>and he has taken him and they traveled with it to . . . .</li>
<li>on the eve of Shabbat Vayoshaʿ, the day when Ibn ʿAmmār departed</li>
<li>for Beirut&mdash;may he never return to his house, and may</li>
<li>his place never know him again (Job 7:10)&mdash;and set out for</li>
<li>Tiberias to fortify himself there. The city is now in</li>
<li>the hands of his (paternal) cousin Abū l-Manāqib.</li>

<li>in this episode and apart from it. As for the details</li>
<li>of the condition of the raʾīs Abū l-Faḍl, the brother, may his Rock preserve him, and the condition</li>
<li>of his family and all his descendants, I already explained it to his excellency</li>
<li>in a number of letters, so I will refrain from repeating it. The travelers</li>
<li>will inform you its details. May [our] Lord, may he be praised,</li>
<li>help us and help him.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peace upon his excellency our teacher</li>
<li>the Third, and peace upon the two princes, his offspring, his dear ones,</li>
<li>and peace to all who accompany him and love him. May the greatness</li>

<li>pride of the priesthood, \\banner of the yeshiva//, and his brother Maṣliaḥ, may our Rock</li>
<li>preserve them and may our Stronghold support them, who strengthen</li>

<li>princes, his dear ones, and all who accompany him and love him, forever.</li>
<li>May salvation come soon.</li>
