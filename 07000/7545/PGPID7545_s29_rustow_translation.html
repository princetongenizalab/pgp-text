<li>what</li>
<li>I am explaining a bit of what</li>
<li>our lord, the head of the yeshiva, may God</li>
<li>shelter him in the refuge of His wings&mdash;explained in his letter concerning</li>
<li>what his condition has come to&nbsp;and that</li>
<li>he is still suffering and he has no place of refuge other than God</li>
<li>the exalted. I have written to his excellency the nagid,</li>
<li>may his reign last forever, and I asked that when</li>
<li>the government fleet sets out, he ask its captain to</li>
<li>rescue our lord the gaʾon, may he find the protection of heaven,</li>
<li>and to rescue his children from Tripoli, if it is possible</li>
<li>for him to embark. I would like his excellency our teacher</li>
<li>the Third, may you be exalted forever, when you appear</li>
<li>before his excellency our lord the nagid&mdash;prince of the people of God,</li>
<li>prince of princes, glory of the house of Israel, standard</li>
<li>of the scholars, light of the West, Mordechai of the age,</li>
<li>head of the ranks of Israel, diadem of virtue,</li>
<li>crown of the dispersion, chariot of Israel and its horsemen,</li>
<li>may our Lord make his days eternal and his years and rule</li>
<li>like the days of heaven over the earth&mdash;to discuss</li>
<li>this matter and to remind him about it in</li>
<li>[&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;], because he is very preoccupied</li>

<li>of Israel, glory of the priesthood, may</li>
<li>the protector of the souls of His pious ones protect him, on this matter</li>

                        <p>"They took it and traveled with it... toward the beginning of Shabbat Vayoshaʿ (=Beshalaḥ?), the day that Ibn ʿAmmār traveled for Beirut—let him return no more to his house, and let not his place know him any more (Job 7:10)—and then traveled for Tiberias (? טברי) to fortify himself there, and the city is now in the hand of his cousin (ibn ʿamm) Abū l-Manāqib." In the bottom section (note that there is still a gap between T-S AS 153.177 and T-S 18J5.3), refers to "in this crisis and others..."; the sender says that he has already explained the condition of the 'brother' Abū l-Faḍl and his family in other letters; he reiterates greetings to the addressee and his two sons; and his own two sons, ʿAzaryahu and Maṣliaḥ, convey their greetings. Ends with a motto that might be reconstructible as [yu]ḥash [yeshaʿ] be-qarov (יוחש ישע בקרוב). </p>
