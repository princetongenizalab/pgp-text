                        <ol>
<li>
<p>A memorandum of testimony that was before us, we the witnesses who sign below on this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>document: Toviya b. Eli b. Khalaf said in our presence, "Be my witnesses and perform the binding symbolic act (qinyan) with me,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as of now, and write and sign (a deed) binding me, with every term of a deed of right, and deliver it to (our) master and l(ord) Solomon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the elder b. Nethanel the elder, rest the soul, in order for him to deliver it to Fā'iza, my fianc&eacute;e, so that it may be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in her possession as a deed conveying rights in the future. Because I declare in your presence &mdash; in a complete declaration, of my free</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will, of my desire and my wish, with my complete senses and choosing, and with my firm willingness, not coerced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor erring nor deceived, rather with whole heart and a willing desire, with fixed will and a sound&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>body, firm in mind, fast in thought &mdash; that I perform a symbolic binding act (qinyan) now upon myself, before I marry&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her, that from the time this Fā'iza enters my home, I will conduct myself with her as the best decent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jews do with decent Jewish women; to pave righteous paths and to abandon [...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subversion and perverseness. I will associate with proper men and not associate with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>corrupt men. I will not bring into my house licentious men, buffoons, frivolous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jesters, and good-for-nothings. I will not enter the house of anyone who clings to licentiousness,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>corruption, and ugly deeds. I will not associate with them for food and drink</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or anything else. I will not purchase for myself a slave girl &mdash; as long as this Fā'iza is with me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in marriage except with her explicit consent. I will not leave Fustat, Egypt,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to travel abroad, as long as Fā'iza is with me, unless she agrees and assents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I, Toviya b. Eli b. Khalaf, undertake all these stipulations, accepting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>completely and strictly. I will fulfill them, confirm them, and uphold them. I will not alter them, nor violate them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nor make them void or null. They are held by me as double, considered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>like the stipulations of the sons of Reuben and Gad, with affirmation before negation. If, God forbid,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I should nullify them or any one of them, the court will have the authority to take action against me and to exact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the punishment of heaven from me. And all disclaimers, conditions, disclaimers of disclaimers, and disclaimers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>derived from disclaimers, to the last possible disclaimer, which I may have made or which others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may have made for me, or which I might make against this deed of conditions are all void</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and nullified in your presence, as of now, with all the terms used by the sages for voiding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>disclaimers and conditions. I, Toviya b. Eli b. Khalaf, undertake the security of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this deed of conditions in the strongest and strictest fashion of all verified valid court deeds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>established by the rabbis and in common practice from this day and forever, not like asmakhta &mdash; collateral</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or formularies". We performed the binding symbolic act (qinyan) with Toviya b. Eli b. Khalaf, known as</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ibn Zaffān (Son of a Buffoon), for this Fā'iza, his fianc&eacute;e, daughter of Solomon b. Nethanel, on all that is written</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and specified above, with an implement suitable for performing it. We wrote and signed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the new moon of Kislev, year 1359</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the era by which we are accustomed to reckon in Fustat, Egypt, which is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>situated on the Nile, Strong and valid. Samuel b. R. Abraham, r(est his) s(oul).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solomon b. Mundhir.</p>
