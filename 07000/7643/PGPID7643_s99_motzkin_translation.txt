Recto


A record of a testimony.


Abu'l-Baraka't, son of R. Elijah - (may he come to a) g(ood) e(nd) - bought from Abu'l-Fad'l b. Mah'a'sin, who is known as Ibn al-Ka'mukhi'


the Kohen - (may he come to a) g{ood) e(nd), a codex of prophets for sixty - five dirhems, Egyptian coins, on the condition that it remain in his possession.


He will not have the right of disposal over it until New Year's eve. If New Year's day arrives and he has not furnished sixty -


five (dirhems) at the established time, the codex is sold fully and completely to Abu'l-Baraka't.


Abu'l-Fad'l will have no part of it under any circumstances , for this is the condition. He collected the dirhems and obtained them from him


in the last decade of the month of Tammu'z, one thousand five hundred and forty, Seleucid Era, in Fust'a't' of Egypt which is situated on the great


river Nile, under the authority of our lord and prince Abraham. We have written down and affixed our signatures to (this description of) what transpired before us as a title


and as evidence. We gave this to the one who has the title. Everything (herein) is firm and clear, sure and correct, settled and enduring.

I say, I who affix my signature, that Abu'l-Baraka't,


the son of R. Elijah the Judge, (may he come to a) g(ood) e(nd), bought from Abu'l-Fad'l
