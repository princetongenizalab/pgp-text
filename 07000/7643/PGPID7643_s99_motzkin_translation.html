<li>
<p>A record of a testimony.</p>

<p>Abu'l-Baraka't, son of R. Elijah - (may he come to a) g(ood) e(nd) - bought from Abu'l-Fad'l b. Mah'a'sin, who is known as Ibn al-Ka'mukhi'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Kohen - (may he come to a) g{ood) e(nd), a codex of prophets for sixty - five dirhems, Egyptian coins, on the condition that it remain in his possession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will not have the right of disposal over it until New Year's eve. If New Year's day arrives and he has not furnished sixty -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>five (dirhems) at the established time, the codex is sold fully and completely to Abu'l-Baraka't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu'l-Fad'l will have no part of it under any circumstances , for this is the condition. He collected the dirhems and obtained them from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the last decade of the month of Tammu'z, one thousand five hundred and forty, Seleucid Era, in Fust'a't' of Egypt which is situated on the great</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>river Nile, under the authority of our lord and prince Abraham. We have written down and affixed our signatures to (this description of) what transpired before us as a title</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and as evidence. We gave this to the one who has the title. Everything (herein) is firm and clear, sure and correct, settled and enduring.</p>
