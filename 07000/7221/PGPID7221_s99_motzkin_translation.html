<p>My letter [to the] most distinguished [master], may God lengthen his life,</p>

<p>p[erpetuate his honored position] and deprive him not of the best of</p>

<li>
<p>for he has mastery over it, God on high be willing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, then; God knows how grieved we were over the loss</p>

<p>you from evil . . . . .  . . . . . may her life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be bound in the bundle of the living and may He comfort you in your mourning. Don't</p>

<li>
<p>ask us how we are. When we go out of the house we lock it,</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>on the day she departed . . . . .  . We say it was on account of</p>

<p>her illness and pregnancy. She had entered her fifth month,</p>
