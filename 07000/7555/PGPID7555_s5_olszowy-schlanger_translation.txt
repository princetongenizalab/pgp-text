On Sunday, the twelfth …
of the year one thousand three hundred fifteen [of the era of the Greeks, in the city of]
Cairo. The Supreme God shall look from His [elevated] heaven …

How [Solomon ben] Mevasser ben Sahl known as al-ᶜAnī, the groom, the young man, [came before the elders] …
who sign below in this document and said to them: Be my witnesses and perform with me the qinyan …
with full rights about all that I am saying before you. And I am not coerced, not [mistaken]
not in error and not drunk, but with full physical faculties and resolve, according to my will, wish and desire [of my soul]
that I married, performed the qinyan, and berothed to me Sara, the young girl, the virgin, daughter of my uncle [Yeshaᶜya ben]
Sahl al-ᶜAnī, by mohar, writ, document and sexual intercourse, according to the law of Moses, the man of God [and according to the custom]
of Israel, the [holy] and pure ones. And I shall dress, clothe, support and respect her. [I shall fulfil all]
her legitimate needs to the best of my strength and possibilities, and I shall be with her in truth, justice, love [and compassion]
and I shall not [afflict or] oppress, or despise her. I shall not diminish her food, clothes and sexual intercourse [like the children of Israel]
who feed, support, dress, clothe, esteem and respect their pure wives [and do all]
they owe them in faithfulness and honesty. And the mohar that I stipulated and allocated for her is fifty coins of silver, the mohar [of her virginity. And I have also]
added for her one hundred fifty good, full, round, weighted dinars
in al-ᶜAzīzī coins. I have advanced her from them, before I come to her, one hundred good dinars …
As for the fifty coins of silver, I will give them to her, on this day, at the time of her marriage. And there will remain incumbent on me and on my estate [after me]
fifty dinars, a true, strong and binding debt : And this Sara, the bride, daughter of Yeshaᶜya accepted
the words of [our dear] groom, son of her uncle, Mevasser ben Sahl, and wanted to be married to him and to be his wife, his help and his partner
in purity, holiness and awe, to obey, esteem and respect him, and to do in his house [all that] the daughters of Israel do
in the house of their husbands, and to behave towards him with love, compassion, honesty and faithfulness, to be /under/ his dominion, and to have her desire directed [towards him]. And
Yeshaᶜya ben Sahl, father of Sara, the young girl, the virgin, came and declared before the elders, and called them to witness [about himself], with full resolve and according to his will, that he took and accepted the payment of the mohar
of his daughter, this Sara, one hundred advanced dinars, [and that] he wanted to marry his daughter, this Sara
to Solomon, his brother's son, with the [aforementioned] mohar. And these are the belongings that
this Sara brought from the house of her father to [the house of her husband Solomon. From gold, from] silver, from copper
and from clothing … seventy five [dinars] … dinars. And Solomon,
the groom, declared before the elders, and called to witness about himself [that all these belongings will be] with him and under his jurisdiction
and in his possession. [And he also took] upon himself that he will [keep them like everything that belongs to him, and that he will not change anything from them without the knowledge] of his wife and without
