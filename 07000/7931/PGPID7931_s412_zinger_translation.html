<li>
<p>We, the undersigned to this deed, were present&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2-3) on Sunday, 8 Kislev 1321 to the dating of deeds (27 November 1009)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>according to which the date is written in Fustat- Miṣr.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sibāʾ bt. Isaac, the dyer, said: &ldquo;Make the symbolic purchase from me, as of now,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and write, sign and witness for me that I received&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my bill of divorce from Ḥusayn b. Abraham, my husband. I released him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from my delayed marriage gift and any trousseau4 that I had in my Ketubba.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(9-10) No dinar, no dirham, no claim whatsoever, no oath and no ban remain for me with this Ḥusayn.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>I have undertaken the maintenance of his child, Harūn (Aaron), his provisions and all his affairs&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(12-13). No claim whatsoever, no harassment, no legal suit nor contention remains for me against him //except his release//.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>We, the witnesses, made the symbolic purchase from this Sibāʾ&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bt. Isaac, the dyer, to Ḥusayn, her divorcée,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b. Abraham regarding everything described in this deed&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with an instrument fitting for purchase. We gave it (i.e. the deed) to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this Ḥusayn according to the command of Sibāʾ, his divorcée,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so it will be in his hand a true and established proof. We have also made a symbolic purchase&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from Ḥusayn b. Abraham to Sibāʾ&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bt. Isaac that no movable possession, no claim in the world, no oath and no ban remain for him against Sibāʾ&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>//except the correct sending of this deed (?).</p>
