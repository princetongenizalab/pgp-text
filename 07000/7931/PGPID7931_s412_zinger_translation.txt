Recto


We, the undersigned to this deed, were present 


(2-3) on Sunday, 8 Kislev 1321 to the dating of deeds (27 November 1009) 

 

according to which the date is written in Fustat- Miṣr. 


Sibāʾ bt. Isaac, the dyer, said: “Make the symbolic purchase from me, as of now, 


and write, sign and witness for me that I received 


my bill of divorce from Ḥusayn b. Abraham, my husband. I released him 


from my delayed marriage gift and any trousseau4 that I had in my Ketubba. 


(9-10) No dinar, no dirham, no claim whatsoever, no oath and no ban remain for me with this Ḥusayn. 

 

I have undertaken the maintenance of his child, Harūn (Aaron), his provisions and all his affairs 


(12-13). No claim whatsoever, no harassment, no legal suit nor contention remains for me against him //except his release//. 

 

We, the witnesses, made the symbolic purchase from this Sibāʾ 


bt. Isaac, the dyer, to Ḥusayn, her divorcée, 


b. Abraham regarding everything described in this deed 


with an instrument fitting for purchase. We gave it (i.e. the deed) to 


this Ḥusayn according to the command of Sibāʾ, his divorcée, 


so it will be in his hand a true and established proof. We have also made a symbolic purchase 


from Ḥusayn b. Abraham to Sibāʾ 


bt. Isaac that no movable possession, no claim in the world, no oath and no ban remain for him against Sibāʾ 


//except the correct sending of this deed (?).
