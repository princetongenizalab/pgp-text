<li>
<p>The servants and slaves,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the family of Ḥabīb, the servant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slaves of the lofty and glorious presence of the elder, may God make his life&nbsp;long, and cause to endure his support, his loftiness, his eminence, his sublimity, his power, his superiority, his influence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and his strength and crush his enemies, kiss the ground before his gracious seat&nbsp;and report to his all-embracing mercy and benevolence the detention of his slave, their son, known</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as Ḥabīb, who is a servant in the office of the chamber, this being on account of&nbsp;the disappearance of the servant Nādir. The slaves swear by God, the exalted, that their aforementioned son does not know the whereabouts of the servant Nādir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They had no dealings with one another. He did not have any special acquaintance with him. The slaves are the female members of the family and are cut off (from the outside world). He has children, who would become orphans were he to die,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>together with his elderly father and old mother, the sight of both of whom has&nbsp;gone, and a blind child. They have been afflicted with disease, illness, poverty,&nbsp;isolation and seclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no one to protect their faces from the humility of begging for foodamong the people except their son, the aforementioned Ḥabīb. By mighty God,&nbsp;they have become isolated and suffered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>throughout his detention for nine months. They have recently sold their garments. In the house there are young girls' who possess no more than the clothes that they have on them day and night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group of slaves, the old among them and the young, have appealed to God, praise be to him, and to the glorious and lofty presence of the elder,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God protect his power from others, make happiness eternal in his courtyard and establish the bounties that are bestowed upon him and upon others, and (have appealed) to his religiosity to grant what they yearn for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and put an end to their poverty by releasing their aforementioned son, Ḥabīb, taking into consideration the good deeds to 'the members of minority communities and the ḍimmīs that God has caused him to perform, he (God) having endeared them to him and caused him to act kindly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to them, and also his efforts to treat everyone in a way that pleases God, praise be to him, for the sake of God, the exalted. God, of exalted name, has facilitated the favourable reception of his words</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the exalted, kingly and glorious presence of the lord al-&rsquo;Afḍal, may God establish his rule, make his days endure, cause his enemies to be cut off by his hands and transmit his commands and judgments throughout the world,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God cause to endure the unity of his slaves. By mighty God and the truth of the all-embracing bounties, the detained slave and also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the slaves (his family) do not have any health-giving sustenance except (what they receive through) alms, but these are forbidden to the slave. They are disgraced and confounded. All they have left</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is God and the mercy of someone in whose heart God may place mercy for them before the glorious presence, may God increase his life-span and his strength and through him strengthen what is weak, in his mercy, amen, by the lord of the universe. The slaves have sought God, the exalted, and the mercy of the glorious, lofty presence with the purpose of obtaining the vindication of his slave,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>their son, through his agency, and by his blessings and privileges, and, further, of (obtaining) the release of the slave, as a benevolent deed for the slaves and as an act of mercy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and compassion for them. May God, the exalted, answer all their pious prayers for him in his mercy, amen, amen, amen. The slaves swear to him ...... God in his heart,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if he realizes the presuppositions that they have concerning him and grants them all-embracing mercy and compassion. To him, may God establish his splendour and destroy his haters, belongs the auspicious, propitious and rightly-guided resolution regarding this, if God wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Praise be to God alone and his benedictions be upon] Muḥammad, his prophet, and his pure family and save him.</p>
