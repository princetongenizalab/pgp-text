                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>To the dignity of the honorable, great and holy master and teacher R. Elijah the judge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(may his) R(ock) p(reserve him), from his slave, who is grateful for (past) favors, Joseph b. Jacob the Kohen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I inform you - may God give you peace - that we left you for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bilbays; however, he did not manage t o find a livelihood there at all, so we went over to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minyat Ghamr where we chanced across th[is f]ellow, the bearer of the letter,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R. Abraham al-Mu'rqi'; we agreed that he should go to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alexandria and bring my wife back, and we further agreed that he should take her packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and go bring her back. We made the symbolic purchase certified in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>court. Your letters had come to the elder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu'I-Suru'r the Kohen, and to the elder Abu'l-T'a'hir. If they have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arrived i n Cairo, send me a letter with the bearer of this letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(informing me) of their arrival. ...... Let me know when they arrive, and whatever (else)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you hear, write me. I had sent you a letter from Bilbays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with Abu H'ayyu'n (in which I said) that you should pay him the rest of the sum you owe for the turban and the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two rugs which are in the possession of Ibn al-S'abba'gh, if you have safely delivered them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to him. If you have not delivered them to him, deliver them to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rabbi Abraham, the bearer of the letter, because we haven't got anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for expenses. I await your letter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We ask from God and from you - in regard to this Rabbi Abraham -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that you encourage him with agreeable words, perhaps he may report them to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say to him, "This loss .... is not of your doing". May God in heaven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>help me to reward you with what is good. (From all the greetings which I sent through you) pick out for yourself the especially good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ones. Inform the elder Abu' Nas'r (that I send him) best regards,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>//And peace//</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(and inform yourself) that the elder Abu'l-Faraj, the son of your maternal uncle, and his son askÂ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about you. Do not neglect (to do something) about his request to write the chief.</p>
</li>
