<li>
<p>we received your letter. Imagine, people everywhere knew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about your courtesy before it was received by us! They knew about your happy events before I did. You act like this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your son does, too. You wrote us in the letter and said "the merchandise is expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>merchandise;" you have no morals, no character and no manners. Is this a reward for your aunt, her mother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and her father? You sent us one who hates me, you have caused me trouble through them.</p>
