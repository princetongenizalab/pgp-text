<li>
<p>I wish to inform the august elder, the chief, R. Elijah, may his glory be exalted and his honor increase, that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we received your letter. Imagine, people everywhere knew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about your courtesy before it was received by us! They knew about your happy events before I did. You act like this,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your son does, too. You wrote us in the letter and said "the merchandise is expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>merchandise;" you have no morals, no character and no manners. Is this a reward for your aunt, her mother</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and her father? You sent us one who hates me, you have caused me trouble through them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>          ] to you the elders, Muqaddams, and judges; for you know the character</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>             ] around us wealth. That was his place with them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>           ] if she did not withdraw from her until the [</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>                 ] sold, and the judge saw, and witnesses gave testimony</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>           ] with him according to their ability</p>
</li>
