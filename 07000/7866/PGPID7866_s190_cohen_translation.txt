Recto, margin
give you the good tidings of absolution and forgiveness [and consider] whatever you do on my behalf as if it were a complete offering upo[n] the altar. May you merit "to see the goodness of God and to visit his sanctuary" (Psalm 27:4). If I did not know about your habit and kindnes[s and] goodness I would not be bothering you. I have nothing of the sereneness of our forefather[s], and I have no means of sustenance. May the h(oly one) b(lessed be) H(e) grant that you be favored by all those who see you, [and] the outcome be your welfare. Your student Samuel b. Jacob the Rav b. Samuel the Rav (who) r(ests in) E(den).
