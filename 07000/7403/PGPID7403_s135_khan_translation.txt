[to ] the fortress, to besiege it and beleaguer it, to position each division


of the victorious soldiers at a (different) part of the fighting and split the battle


in separate islands so that their noble qualities be used to their best effect,


to draw up the excellent cavalry along all the roads,


to take up position upon them and guard, and to display alertness and watchfulness


at night and act according to what caution dictates.

and promised them all-embracing kindnesses and favourable treatment.


They set off with the bird of good fortune fluttering above them and the sigus of victory

near to the aforementioned fortress and made an assault on it early on Tuesday morning. There were watchmen in it
