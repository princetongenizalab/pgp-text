We have also nullified all secret dispositions and conditions which may be made for us and which we have made concerning this document,</li><li>as a decree of the Sages.

He has released each of them effective immediately any claim</li><li>with which he could have against them, with a complete release, orally and in his heart, in this world and in the world to come, since</li><li>all that he could had coming to him he had received from the two of them, completely and totally, and</li><li>nothing remains for him from all the assets of this document except for the third of the amount which was mentioned therein for </li><li>the Elder Abū al-Faraj al-Jubaylī (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Yeshu‘a the beloved ha-Levi b.

We wrote and signed (this document) in order that there would be a title of right and proof</li><li>since that has remained in his hand until now. That took place in the first ten-day period of the month of Shevaṭ of the year 1429 (of the Era) of Documents,</li><li>in Fusṭāṭ Egypt. Proper and clear and enduring. Isaac b.
