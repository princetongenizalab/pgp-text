                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol><li>On Tuesday the fourth of the month of Av</li><li>1473 (of the Era) of Documents, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River, </li><li>jurisdiction of his glorious excellency, diadem of beauty, (his) honor,</li><li>greatness (and) holiness, our teacher and our master, inimitable in our generation, our prince and prince </li><li>of God among us, our lord Nathaniel ha-Levi, “Israel’s chariots and horsemen,” </li><li>may his name endure forever, m(aster) Samuel the Elder b. Solomon </li><li>the Elder (who) r(ests in) E(den) and M(r.) Eleazar the Elder b. M(r.) Isaac the Elder (who) r(ests in) E(den), appeared before the session (of the court)</li><li>of his excellency our lord, inimitable in our generation, may his name endure forever, and M(r.)</li><li>Samuel advanced a claim upon M(r.) Eleazar for what was recorded as follows:</li><li>M(r.) Samuel said, “I agree that  between me and between the aforementioned M(r.) Eleazar there was</li><li>a partnership (shirka) in silk, its total value being one hundred and fifty dinars. </li><li>I contributed fifty-five dinars from that amount, and he contributed ninety-five </li><li>dinars. Together, we bought silk with the aforementioned total amount </li><li>as we had agreed, namely that the profit would be split: one third for me</li><li>and two thirds would be for him.” M(r.) Samuel said that his partner M(r.) Eleazar</li><li>sold some of the aforementioned silk to Joseph b. al-Karrām for fifty-</li><li>four dinars, and its price came to him. “I also sold</li><li>some of the silk for forty-seven dinars, of which I transferred to</li><li>M(r.) Eleazar twenty-seven dinars, and the remainder </li><li>was twenty dinars which remained with ‘the workers’ (al-mu‘āmilīn) outside of</li><li>Sammanūd.” Then he said in the very same (court) session that </li><li>debts demanded his travel to the town of Tyre, and he agreed to</li><li>division of the remainder of the aforementioned silk, then the two of them divided it</li></ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol><li>according to its total, and each of them took his portion of the silk which </li><li>was on hand.   My remaining obligation was the aforementioned twenty dinars held</li><li>in al-Maḥalla. When we dispatched (a letter) for his withdrawal (of the funds) from my (account), </li><li>the document of his partner M(r.) Eleazar reached him, saying that he had erred concerning the gold which </li><li>was with him.     Then M(r.) Eleazar, who is the aforementioned Manṣūr al-</li><li>Dimashqī, was asked about the opinion of his counterparty, and he said that </li><li>the fifty dinars were collected and received in the leather bag, in which he and his partner had the right</li><li>of unilateral disposition, likewise, concerning the twenty-seven dinars.</li><li>He attested to splitting the (remaining) silk, and each of them</li><li>took his share of the aforementioned silk into his possession, and this (statement) was</li><li>(supported by) others. Then // Manṣūr said// … Samuel went to al-Maḥalla</li><li>so that I would pay that which was due him exclusively, because the twenty</li><li>remaining dinars had not come at the time of their payment, and he returned</li><li>from al-Maḥalla and went to travel again on Sunday </li><li>to al-Maḥalla //again on the day …// his exit, the leather bag disappeared </li><li>and I found that they lacked sixty-six</li><li>dinars.   When the court asked m(aster) Samuel regarding</li><li>the twenty dinars which he said remained with the</li><li>workers, //had he taken them upon himself …// and he said that he received them himself at the time of the silk distribution.</li><li>In the same court session, m(aster) Samuel said</li><li>that the two of them, at the time of the silk distribution, reckoned a gain</li><li>of twelve dinars’ profit, and it was turned over to him along with the total</li><li>of what was collected. Abū Manṣūr al-Dimashqī said in the session (of the court)</li></ol>
