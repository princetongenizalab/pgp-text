Recto

In (your) name, Oh Merci(ful)!
My letter [to] you - may God lengthen the life of my master, the distinguished elder, and perpetuate
his honored position, support, happiness, health and well-being -
(is written because of my) great longing to you; may God bring us together in happy circumstances
in His grace and favor - He has the power to do that,
God willing. I inform in (this letter) my master the elder that I left
the daughter of my paternal uncle; I had a di'na'r             which Thqr
b. Bana'n owed me, and S'a'[fi'] the son of my paternal uncle told me that he had paid it
to the daughter of my paternal uncle, but I had heard nothing about that.
A few days ago I came across Sa'fi', the son of my paternal uncle,
and said to him, "You have knowledge that the daughter of my paternal uncle took the di'na'r
you obtained for me together with the di'na'r which she owes me and which she has in
her pillow," He said, "I know nothing (about it)". The antimony which
you sent me, - I haven't seen it. I would like an answer
for this letter soon. Let me know what happens
with the di'na'r. Tell me your news,
and don't stop (letting) me (know) about you ....
and all …
