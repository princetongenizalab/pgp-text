<li>In (your) name, Oh Merci(ful)!</li>
<li>My letter [to] you - may God lengthen the life of my master, the distinguished elder, and perpetuate</li>
<li>his honored position, support, happiness, health and well-being -</li>
<li>(is written because of my) great longing to you; may God bring us together in happy circumstances</li>
<li>in His grace and favor - He has the power to do that,</li>
<li>God willing. I inform in (this letter) my master the elder that I left</li>
<li>the daughter of my paternal uncle; I had a di'na'r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which Thqr</li>
<li>b. Bana'n owed me, and S'a'[fi'] the son of my paternal uncle told me that he had paid it</li>
<li>to the daughter of my paternal uncle, but I had heard nothing about that.</li>
<li>A few days ago I came across Sa'fi', the son of my paternal uncle,</li>
<li>and said to him, "You have knowledge that the daughter of my paternal uncle took the di'na'r</li>
<li>you obtained for me together with the di'na'r which she owes me and which she has in</li>
<li>her pillow," He said, "I know nothing (about it)". The antimony which</li>
<li>you sent me, - I haven't seen it. I would like an answer</li>
<li>for this letter soon. Let me know what happens</li>
<li>with the di'na'r. Tell me your news,</li>
<li>and don't stop (letting) me (know) about you ....</li>
<li>and all &hellip;</li>
