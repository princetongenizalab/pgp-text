<li>‘Happy are those who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times’  (Pss 106:3).  </li>
<li>‘They have distributed freely, they have given to the poor; their righteousness endures forever; their horn is exalted in honour’ (Pss 112:9).</li>
<li>To the honourable, great, holy, venerable, dear, splendid, glorious diadem and crown;  </li>
<li>to this holy community, who are pious, righteous, upright and pure,</li>
<li>who tremble at the word of the Lord – may God preserve them – who  flourish […]  </li>
<li>about whom it was written in the Bible (Deut 1:11): ‘May the Lord increase you a thousand times more and bless you,  </li>
<li>as he has promised you!’ And may he save you from every distress and  anguish. Amen. Greetings  </li>
<li>from the Lord of Peace and from your servant Mosqo, who is poor,  cursed, wretched, penniless,  </li>
<li>impoverished, ‘an injured man’ (Prov 29:13) and blind, so that I cannot  see. May God be good to you and may you perform  </li>
<li>for me an act of charity and God shall reckon it to you as a righteous  act. For there are four souls with me,  </li>
<li>and they will die of hunger. For the sake of the Lord and your own  sakes, do not send me away from you empty-handed,  </li>
<li>for I trust in the Lord and in you. I have come before you like a bird in  a trap; do not leave me  </li>
<li>humiliated and [embittered (?).] I shall present my supplication before  the Lord and before you, to show me pity, to strengthen</li>
<li>my hands, according to your good custom. ‘Do not let the oppressed  return in shame’ (Pss 74:21). And for this kindness of yours</li>
<li>that you will do for me, may the Lord repay you, and may your reward  be complete from the Lord,  </li>
<li>God of [Israel]. May He bless you and multiply you and give you  Abraham’s blessing –  </li>
<li>to you and your descendants. And may He save you from all trials and  [tribulations], and from weeping and distress.  </li>
<li>[…] king. And may they be […]  </li>
<li>[…] you. [And] do not hide your eyes from me, because I have no one in the world  </li>
<li>to favour me except for you alone. May you merit looking upon the  delight of the Lord and visiting  </li>
<li>His temple, and may He fulfill for you the verse: ‘[For] plainly they  will see the return of  </li>
<li>[the Lord to Zion]’ (Isa 52:8). ‘Jacob will rejoice; Israel will be glad’  (Pss 14:7; 53:7). May your wellbeing increase and may your honour  </li>
<li>accrue, and may it not diminish, but grow greater forever. Amen Sela.  </li>
