Yes'u'ah b. Samuel (may he) r(est in) p(aradise)


T'a'ho'r b. Zekhariah (may he come to a) g(ood) e(nd).


Some cheese arrived with Maimo'n b. Nissi'm of Syracuse


                   Its share was sold to the people of the Port City now that


we have established the religiosity of the above mentioned Mr. Maimo'n


and those who have bought it from him: Khalaf and Ibn al-.…


52 molds, as the witnesses present at the sale testified.


Whoever has been buying any of the cheese may buy it in good


conscience, for it is pure, and sold by a man obeying the laws of purity. We affix our signatures


for the sake of those who have bought (this cheese) and for those who may buy from them, [        ] considering what


(we know) of it, during the last decade of the month of Si'wa'n, of the year


five thousand and one after the creation in No' A'mo'n on the shore of the great sea.


May peace come to all of Israel forever and ever. Isaac b. H'alfo'n
