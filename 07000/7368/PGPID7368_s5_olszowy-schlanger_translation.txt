He created them, and blessed them (Gen. 5: 2). … I will betroth you in justice and righteousness (Hos. 2: 21). I will betroth you to me in faithfulness (Hos. 2: 22). He who found a wi[fe found]

my convenant [does not exist] day and night, and if I have not appointed the [laws of the hea]ven and the earth, I shall cast away the seed of Jacob [and my servant David] and not take from his seed a rul[er over]
