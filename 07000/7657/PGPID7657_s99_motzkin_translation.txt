I present my son Solomon with a Torah commentary


I present my son Solomon with a Torah commentary in five volumes, as well as


the prayerbook of Rabbe'nu' Solomon (of blessed memory). No one else has any right to it. It is a gift for my son


Solomon, a gift which cannot be taken back. A gift of a healthy man, not


of one on his death-bed. All codices and copper vessels in my house


belong to no one else. They are his, a definite gift. The remaining


smaller codices he should divide with his brother Abu Zikri. The


codex of the Torah, Prophets and Hagiographa is my son Solomon's. He may teach


the pupils from it. His brother must not take them from him, nor divide them


with him at all. They are my son Solomon's, a gift, whether he be a teacher or whether


he not be a teacher. His brother has no right to that at all â€¦. as


God [is] my [witness]. I wrote this myself. I, Elljah, son of R. Ze[kharia.
