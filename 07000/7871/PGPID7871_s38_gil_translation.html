<li>
<p>Those who affixed their signatures and names</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(2-3) at the end (of this document declare) that in the first decade of the month of Teveth of the year 1555</p>
</li>
<li> </li>
<li>
<p>of the documents, we were contacted by al-Shaykh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abūʾl-Thinā al-Ṣayrāfī b. al-Shaykh Abū</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saʿd al-Ḥazzān ha-Qāvuāʿ, of the synagogue of the Jerusalemites,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may it be rebuilt and reestablished during the times of the whole House of Israel,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>known as Ibn Ṭayyib, may God preserve him. He requested</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>us to help him rent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an apartment from the waqf, in the vicinity of the Synagogue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(11-14) where he and his father should establish themselves; but as there was no empty apartment at that time, nor was it possible to evict anybody from his apartment so as to let them receive it, he told us: I am willing</p>
</li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li>
<p>to rebuild the ruined compound, the ruin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>known as Dār Sitt Ghazāl, that is adjacent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the gate of the well belonging to the Synagogue of the Palestinians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(18-19) You will help me repair it with a small sum, of 200 dir., and also with</p>
</li>
<li> </li>
<li>
<p>timber that is at your disposal. I shall spend </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the remaining (sum) for its rebuilding from my own and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rent….</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso, right side (column b)</h3>
                    
                        <p></p>
<ol>
<li>A house whose neighborhood is built up is better</li>
<li>(2-3) than one adjacent to ruins. Also there is the fact that it will afterwards yield profit</li>
<li> </li>
<li>for the entire waqf. So we said to him: Yes,</li>
<li>we will accept your request on the condition that when you</li>
<li>have covered the expenditure that you made</li>
<li>and you decide to live in it (further) you should rent</li>
<li>the apartment from us, for the sum of money</li>
<li>that it will be worth at that time.</li>
<li>He then accepted the condition which we imposed upon him</li>
<li>as mentioned by us above, and we accepted his</li>
<li>request. And we herewith affixed</li>
<li>(13-14) our signatures to this deed as mentioned above and said to him: Adhere to its text</li>
<li> </li>
<li>concerning our lease so that there be unanimity </li>
<li>of opinion. (Canceled: greetings). One succeeds</li>
<li>by praying to God. Greetings.</li>
