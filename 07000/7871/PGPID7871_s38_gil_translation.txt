Those who affixed their signatures and names


(2-3) at the end (of this document declare) that in the first decade of the month of Teveth of the year 1555

 

of the documents, we were contacted by al-Shaykh


Abūʾl-Thinā al-Ṣayrāfī b. al-Shaykh Abū


Saʿd al-Ḥazzān ha-Qāvuāʿ, of the synagogue of the Jerusalemites,


may it be rebuilt and reestablished during the times of the whole House of Israel,


known as Ibn Ṭayyib, may God preserve him. He requested


us to help him rent


an apartment from the waqf, in the vicinity of the Synagogue


(11-14) where he and his father should establish themselves; but as there was no empty apartment at that time, nor was it possible to evict anybody from his apartment so as to let them receive it, he told us: I am willing

 
 
 

to rebuild the ruined compound, the ruin


known as Dār Sitt Ghazāl, that is adjacent


to the gate of the well belonging to the Synagogue of the Palestinians.


(18-19) You will help me repair it with a small sum, of 200 dir., and also with

 

timber that is at your disposal. I shall spend 


the remaining (sum) for its rebuilding from my own and


rent….



Verso, right side (column b)


A house whose neighborhood is built up is better
(2-3) than one adjacent to ruins. Also there is the fact that it will afterwards yield profit
 
for the entire waqf. So we said to him: Yes,
we will accept your request on the condition that when you
have covered the expenditure that you made
and you decide to live in it (further) you should rent
the apartment from us, for the sum of money
that it will be worth at that time.
He then accepted the condition which we imposed upon him
as mentioned by us above, and we accepted his
request. And we herewith affixed
(13-14) our signatures to this deed as mentioned above and said to him: Adhere to its text
 
concerning our lease so that there be unanimity 
of opinion. (Canceled: greetings). One succeeds
by praying to God. Greetings.
