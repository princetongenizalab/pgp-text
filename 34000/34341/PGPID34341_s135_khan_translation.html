<p>The slave Ja&lsquo;far</p>

<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slave of my master, the glorious leader, may God prolong his life and cause to endure his strength, his support, his safety</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and his bounty and crush his enemies, congratulates his glorious presence, may God cause his safety to endure, in this blessed year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ hundred and] twenty, [may God and make eternal] its blessing, and make it the most blessed and happy year for his glorious presence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and let it not bring the delay of a high appointment for him. Likewise my gracious lord [and] glorious [presence,]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God cause his support to endure, I ask God to make it for him the most blessed of years through his grace and munificence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His slave congratulates my lord [ ] the leader in his present circumstances and asks God to allow him to achieve his wish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slave requests that they do not withdraw their support from me, for I have no one to turn to except them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ask God to grant the pious prayers that I make for them day and night. The slave relies on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God, the exalted, and on the munificence of his glorious presence for assistance in preventing them from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>withdrawing their support from me. I ask God to answer my pious prayers, for the slave is sorely pressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in a state of weakness. He has no one to turn to except God and them. I ask God to make complete for them his bounties.</p>
