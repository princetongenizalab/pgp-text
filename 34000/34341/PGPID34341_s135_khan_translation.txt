The slave Jaʿfar


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


The slave of my master, the glorious leader, may God prolong his life and cause to endure his strength, his support, his safety


and his bounty and crush his enemies, congratulates his glorious presence, may God cause his safety to endure, in this blessed year


[ hundred and] twenty, [may God and make eternal] its blessing, and make it the most blessed and happy year for his glorious presence


and let it not bring the delay of a high appointment for him. Likewise my gracious lord [and] glorious [presence,]


may God cause his support to endure, I ask God to make it for him the most blessed of years through his grace and munificence.


His slave congratulates my lord [ ] the leader in his present circumstances and asks God to allow him to achieve his wish.


The slave requests that they do not withdraw their support from me, for I have no one to turn to except them.


I ask God to grant the pious prayers that I make for them day and night. The slave relies on


God, the exalted, and on the munificence of his glorious presence for assistance in preventing them from


withdrawing their support from me. I ask God to answer my pious prayers, for the slave is sorely pressed


in a state of weakness. He has no one to turn to except God and them. I ask God to make complete for them his bounties.

Our sufficiency is God, alone. Praise be to God alone, his benedictions be upon our lord Muḥammad, the prophet, and his family and save them, if God wills.
