<li>[(To) the honour, the glor]y, the grandeur, the diadem, the splendour, the honour,</li>
<li>the greatness, and the holiness of our teacher and rabbi Pinḥas the outstanding Rav,</li>
<li>the fortress and the tower, may his Guardian bless him and save him from his enemies</li>
<li>and ill-wishers, though he stumbles, he does not fall down, for the Lord gives him support, the son of our rabbi,</li>
<li>the Rav, R. Meshullam (may his) m(emory) be for a b(lessing), may the deceased receive mercy and the surviving receive grace,</li>
<li>so may it be (God&rsquo;s) will. If (I were) to express the greatness of the love</li>

<li>&lsquo;Tree, tree, with what shall I bless you?&rsquo;&rdquo; etc. When R.</li>
<li>Shemarya the cantor arrived, he told me (lit. &ldquo;his slave&rdquo;) that you (lit. &ldquo;your glory&rdquo;) sent me</li>
<li>a note with him and requested of him ... [...]</li>

<li>who annulled the [...] that is upon his brother Fakhīr(?) b. Mūsā. Our master and rabbi Moshe, the great Rav, the unique one of the generation and its wonder, from the rising [of the sun to its setting], sent [...].</li>
