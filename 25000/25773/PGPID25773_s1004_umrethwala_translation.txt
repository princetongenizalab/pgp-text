In the name of God [the merciful and compassionate]
May God per[petuate the the reign of my master the illustrious wazīr]
The most righteous, commander of the forces, the leader [the protector of the judges of Muslims]
[And the guide of the duʿāt of the faith[ful]
Commander of the faithful, and perpetuate [
his commands and rulings [
He asks that benefaction be extended on him [and kindness be shown to him]
