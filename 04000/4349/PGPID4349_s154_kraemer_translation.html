                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>The servant of his honor</li>
<li>She’erit the cantor</li>
<li>To his honor, our master and teacher, the prince, the wise and discerning physician, </li>
<li>Moses, may God preserve him. </li>
<li>His servant She'erit kisses his feet, </li>
<li>may God safeguard his excellency. After I visited you, </li>
<li>and the matter you know was decided </li>
<li>between us, a man came to me requesting </li>
<li>that I conduct a circumcision ceremony tomorrow morning in the </li>
<li>(synagogue of the) Iraqians, may it flourish as long as Israel lasts.</li>
<li>Would his honor kindly give me a stay </li>
<li>until after the Sabbath, or else do as he sees fit, so that (people) </li>
<li>not say that because (the man) is poor (She’erit) slighted him, </li>
<li>and were he rich he would have come and performed the ceremony for him. You</li>
<li>know our colleagues! Your servant is steadily engaged </li>
<li>in (the synagogue of) the Iraqians in this and like matters. </li>
<li>If you cannot give me a postponement, take </li>
<li>a(nother) cantor if you wish, and I shall compensate you </li>
<li>in some other way. I inform you, </li>
<li>and await a reply </li>
<li>from your honor, with your unstinting indulgence. May you never lack </li>
<li>those you serve and love you. </li>
<li>Whereas this matter came up this morning in the synagogue, </li>
<li>I neglected informing you on account of your servant’s concern with his son and his journey. </li>
<li>Now I inform you about the matter. </li>
<li>Let it not be though that I had any intention but to serve you, </li>
<li>on my oath.</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>To his honor, the sublime, most majestic, and lordly court, Moses, </li>
<li>the sun of sages, may God perpetuate his glory.</li>
