Recto

The servant of his honor
She’erit the cantor
To his honor, our master and teacher, the prince, the wise and discerning physician, 
Moses, may God preserve him. 
His servant She'erit kisses his feet, 
may God safeguard his excellency. After I visited you, 
and the matter you know was decided 
between us, a man came to me requesting 
that I conduct a circumcision ceremony tomorrow morning in the 
(synagogue of the) Iraqians, may it flourish as long as Israel lasts.
Would his honor kindly give me a stay 
until after the Sabbath, or else do as he sees fit, so that (people) 
not say that because (the man) is poor (She’erit) slighted him, 
and were he rich he would have come and performed the ceremony for him. You
know our colleagues! Your servant is steadily engaged 
in (the synagogue of) the Iraqians in this and like matters. 
If you cannot give me a postponement, take 
a(nother) cantor if you wish, and I shall compensate you 
in some other way. I inform you, 
and await a reply 
from your honor, with your unstinting indulgence. May you never lack 
those you serve and love you. 
Whereas this matter came up this morning in the synagogue, 
I neglected informing you on account of your servant’s concern with his son and his journey. 
Now I inform you about the matter. 
Let it not be though that I had any intention but to serve you, 
on my oath.

Verso

To his honor, the sublime, most majestic, and lordly court, Moses, 
the sun of sages, may God perpetuate his glory.
