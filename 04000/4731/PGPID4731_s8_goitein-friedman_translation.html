<li>This is what I testify, \\I//, Maḍmūn b. Sālim: Abraham b. Yishū wrote</li>
<li>the letters a few days before \\he settled the account// with the nākhudā Bashīr; and we,</li>
<li>namely I, Maḍmūn b. Sālim and Sheikh Abraham b. Yishū, handed them over to Sheikh</li>
<li>Abū ʿAlī the Egyptian b. Ṭayyib after one or several days. Now,</li>
<li>when there remained only one night before the sailing, we all made the account with12 the nākhudā</li>
<li>Bashīr in one place. There were listed for Sheikh Joseph b. Abraham</li>
<li>and Sheikh Khalaf b. Isaac in the boat ‘Gazelle,’ 5 ½ bahārs of </li>
<li>ginger, worth 22 mithqāls. And the nākhudā Bashīr</li>
<li>took the freight from the ginger, for he insisted</li>
<li>on taking for it gold \\as his freight// {alt. tr.: because he refused to take gold for its freight}. There remained to their credit 11 mithqāls,</li>
<li>constituting one-third of their assets. In the shaffāra, there was registered for them one bahār</li>
<li>less two qīrāṭs pepper, free of freight. Nothing was salvaged for Sheikh</li>
<li>Abraham b. Yishū, of eleven bahārs of ginger in the shaffāra,</li>
<li>except for two bahārs, no more. There remained, however, the merchandise, both ginger and pepper,</li>
<li>which had been in the ship. {lit., ‘The remainder of the merchandise...was in the ship.’} In the shaffāra, there were salvaged only</li>
<li>three bahārs of pepper belonging exclusively to Abraham b. Yishū and one bahārs less</li>
<li>two qīrāṭs for Sheikh Joseph b. Abraham and Sheikh Khalaf b. Isaac.</li>
<li>I {alt. tr.: we} verified this from the shatmī of the ship, which was kept by</li>
<li>Sheikh Makkī b. Abu ʾl-Hawl, as the memos in the</li>
<li>ship had been lost, and those that had been in the shaffāra also were lost.</li>
<li>No ginger belonging to Sheikh Joseph or Sheikh Khalaf had been carried in the shaffāra,</li>
<li>none whatsoever. This is what I testify, I, Maḍmūn b. Sālim.</li>

<li>Abraham b. Ishū had eleven</li>
<li>bahārs of ginger, from which its freight was to be deducted Of these,</li>
<li>there were salvaged in the shaffāra two bahārs, free of freight.</li>
<li>The rest was in the ship ‘Gazelle.’ Written by Abraham</li>
<li>b. Fayyūmī, who is sincere</li>
<li>in affection for you.</li>
