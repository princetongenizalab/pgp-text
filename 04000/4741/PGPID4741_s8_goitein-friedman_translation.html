<li>The Lord will ward off from you all sickness, etc.</li>
<li>The servant of his excellency, your honor, great and holy master and lord Saadya the respected elder—may God protect you, grant you success, straighten</li>
<li>your paths, give life to all your children and grant you the merit to enjoy their Torah and their marriage!—kisses your hands. I have learned</li>
<li>that there had been sickness in your home, and God granted recovery. Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love. I, your servant, heard of your kindness</li>
<li>to R. Samuel. May God receive from him the best of prayers [for you] and make this a light</li>
<li>in front of you in this world and the next world! I have already sent for him the forty dirhems. Please collect your debt from them, and let him use for expenses</li>
<li>the balance. God knows, I had to take them out of my mouth. I already sent him letters</li>
<li>and informed him that the congregation would like him to be a schoolteacher. They promised 20 dirhems a week plus gratuities at</li>
<li>all times. But I did not receive an answer from him. I even sent one letter with Sheikh</li>
<li>Abū ʿAlī the prominent merchant, the Alexandrian. He met with him and told him: Send me the answer. He stayed there</li>
<li>afterwards for some time, but he did not give him anything. As to other matters, when I disembarked, I arrived on Friday </li>
<li>[...] with Sheikh Abu ʾl-Baqā b. Ḥubaysh the Levite and Sālim</li>
<li>[...] and I received 24 dirhems (?)</li>

                        <p>I owe Ibn [...]. I don’t know what obliged him to give me the supervisio and why he reversed the situation. I had (or: have) already perished from the cheese and was (or: have become) perplexed as to what I should do. Were it not for the ‘little one’ //being an orphan//, who already has matured and has no one in the world except God,</p>
<p> </p>

                        <ol>
<li>I would go to Sicily or to Eretz Israel. I would appreciate your kindly meeting with my lord al-Mēvīn. Please inform him</li>
<li>what happened to me and (ask) how he accepts everything said about me. Let him (or: you should) ask him, what the reason is for this. And if you should see my brother, he should inform me,</li>
<li>or someone who will teach will come to the city, because they are not to be satisfied. May your well-being and the well-being of your children increase! And to my lord Sheikh Abu ʾl-[. . .] and his brothers peace. And peace. </li>
