I have already asked my lord that when he writes me a letter
to write it only in Hebrew script. The motivation for this
is strengthening your own interests with me, because I
do not read Arabic, and when a letter arrives, I have to
bring it to someone who can read it to me, and I then forget
its contents later on, and I fear that there will be something in it
. . .
