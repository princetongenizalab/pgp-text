The administrators of the Compound of the Jerusalemites are advised to pay to the ‘Mother of Avraham,’
better known under the name ‘the Mother of the Little Calf’ 9 ½ dirhams,
her share in the revenue from the Compound of the Jerusalemites for the year 1477 [of the Seleucid Era, A.D. 1165/6].
And Peace. Shemuel b. Saadya haLevi (may he rest in Eden)
