<li>
<p>In Your name, O Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letter of your excellency, the illustrious elder, my master, has arrived. It was the most pleasant letter that came</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the most delightful message that reached me. I read and understood it and was pleased to learn that you were well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your affairs successful, for which I praised the Lord very much. Now, I ask God to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reunite us {lit., ‘facilitate our reunion’} under the most pleasant circumstances and in the best of spirits, through His favor and mercy,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God willing. You, my master—may God make your honored position permanent!—wrote that you kindly sold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the silk and sent goods for {alt. tr.: purchased with} its proceeds and that you sent them in the ships of Rāshmit (!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I {alt. tr.: we} learned (however) that Rāshmit’s two ships were total losses. May the Holy one blessed be He</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compensate me {alt. tr.: us} and you! Do not ask (me), my master, how much I was distressed by the loss of the cargo belonging to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But the Creator will {alt. tr.: may the Creator} compensate you soon. In any case, there is no counsel {lit., ‘stratagem’} against</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the decree of God. All the copper (vessels) that you sent with Abū Alī</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arrived, and the ‘table-bowl’ {alt. tr.: ‘table jug’} also arrived. It was exactly as I wished —may God give you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a good reward and undertake your compensation (for only He is able to do it adequately)! You, my master, mentioned that you approached the kārdāl gently, {Alt. tr.: You, my master, mentioned the affair of the kārdāl. You approach him, my master, with wily graciousness}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in order to get something for us back from him. Perhaps you should threaten him that here in Aden we excommunicate {Alt. tr.: and ask him to pay us. My master, were you to threaten him that we excommunicate in Aden}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anyone that owes us something and does not fulfill his commitments. Maybe, he will be afraid of the excommunication. {Alt. tr.: whoever does not pay a debt to us, perhaps he would fear the excommunication.}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If he does not pay, we shall issue an official letter of excommunication  {Alt. tr.: If he does not deliver anything/merchandise to us, we shall write a real letter of excommunication}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and send it to him, so that he will become aware of his crime. {Alt. tr.: and send it to him, until he attends to his disgraceful behavior.} The red betel nuts arrived,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as well as the two washbasins—may God give you a good reward! Please do not send me any more red</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>betel nuts, for they are not good. If there are to be had white fresh betel nuts, it will be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all right. Please do not send me anything {add: else}, whether betel nuts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or any other goods you acquire for me, in partnership with anyone, but specify what belongs to each person and (for) every</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>item purchased. {Add: This is the greatest favor you can do for me.} I am sending you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a broken ewer and a dipper that together weigh seven pounds less a quarter. Please</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make me a ewer of the same measure from its copper, for its copper is good copper. The</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>weight of the ewer should be five pounds exactly. I am sending also eighteen and a quarter pounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of good yellow copper in bars and five pounds of Qalʿī ‘lead’ in a big mold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a piece of Egyptian ‘lead’ (in the form of ) a shell. Please put the bars,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ‘lead’, and what remains from the manufacture of the ewer together and have made for me, your servant,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>{add: ⟦a lamp⟧} two table jugs for two platters, each table jug being of</p>

                        <ol>
<li>
<p>seventeen fills, of the same form {alt. tr.: make} as the table jug you sent me; they should be of good workmanship. From the rest of all the copper (ṣufr) make me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>{add: a lamp, it should be:} an attractive lamp. Its column should be octagonal and stout; its base should be in the form of a lampstand with strong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>feet. On its head there should be a copper (naḥās) lamp with two ends for two wicks, which should be set on the end of the column so that it could move up and down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the three, the column, the stand and the lamp, should be separate parts. If they could</p>

<li>
<p>make the feet in spirals, let it be so, for this is more beautiful. The late</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abu ʾl-Faraj al-Jubaylī made a lamp of such a description. Perhaps this will be {alt. tr.: can be made}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>like it. This year, I did not succeed in sending gold or silk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead, I am sending currency, 20 Malikī dinars, old dinars of good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gold. Please pay with it {alt. tr.: them} the fee for the labor of the coppersmith and with the rest buy me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a {add: small} quantity of ‘eggs’ and cardamom, and if this is not available, anything else, which God—may He be praised!—makes available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, please, send everything with the first ship sailing. Please buy me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two washbasins, of average size, somewhat larger than those you sent me, and a large washbasin, which holds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two water skins of water, measuring two siqāyas. I am sending you what has no importance or value,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>namely two rubāʿiyyas of white sugar; a bottle, in a tight basket {alt. tr.: firmly set in a basket/in a basket—of muḥkam glass}, filled with raisins; and in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a mazza a pound of Maghrebi kohl, a pound of costus, a pound of vitriol, half a pound of litharge,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three ounces of ʿilk gum, and five dasts of Egyptian paper; furthermore, in a little basket seven</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>molds of ‘kosher’ cheese; five packages altogether. Furthermore, all the copper (naḥās) sent by me is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in a canvas. This makes six packages. I wrote on each: ʿAbraham Yijū,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shipment of Joseph,’ and sent the whole together with the 20 dinars with Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aḥmad, the captain, b. Abu ʾl-Faraj. Furthermore, in a satchel there are two linen fūṭas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the children and two network veils dyed with carthamus. Please {add: ⟦forward them⟧} accept delivery and forward them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to Sheikh Abu ʾl-Surūr b. Khallūf al-Ṭalḥī, as well as the letter destined for him. His name is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the satchel. My lord mentioned that there remained {add: in my credit}, from last year, copper (naḥās) to manufacture two bowls for drinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>water. Kindly send them with the other copper. Altogether there are seven packages with the satchel of (21) Abu ʾl-Surūr al-Ṭalḥī. May my master receive for his esteemed self the best greetings! And upon you be peace!</p>
