                        <p>19) &hellip; On Monday 9</p>
<p>20) Kislev, there arrived [here in Alexandria some people] who were reported to have brought with them a decree from our lord [the vizier], the prince of princes [sar ha-sarim], may his glory be exalted.</p>
<p>21) They [the people with the decree] assembled a big crowd and waved the document around [yumandilū bi-l-kitāb]. With them was the evil woman dripping with lust [al-rashʿa al-zimma al-nāṭīfāniyya]. They made a clamor about it [yaghāghū] in the markets&nbsp;</p>
<p>22) and the houses until I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore [ḥattā saʿuba ʿalayya dhālik]. So I went to the governor [al-wālī] and requested of him&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right margin 1) that the decree be treated as is the usual custom and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right margin 2) [small lacuna] . . . brought to the synagogue&nbsp;</p>
<p>Top margin 1-3) so that the noble orders contained in it could be obeyed [li-yumtathal awāmiruhu al-karīma] and so that they would stop announcing [it] from the markets and [stop such] breaches [al-kharq, presumably of decorum].</p>
<p>Top margin 4-8) Because even though it is a public decree [kitāb ʿāmmī], it should not have been treated this way. A noble decree [of the vizier: kitābuhu al-karīm], when it reaches my lord Fakhr al-Mulk [the governor of Alexandria], may God make his victory glorious&mdash;he kisses it and puts it on his eyes. The Jews, by contrast, take it around from place to place [yaʾkudhūhu min hawn ilā hawn].</p>
<p>Top margin 10) I informed him of this, and he will do what he sees fit [yafʿal fīhi mā yarā].</p>
