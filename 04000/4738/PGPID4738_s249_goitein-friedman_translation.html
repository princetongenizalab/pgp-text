                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In Your name, O Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will walk, without breaking stride; when you run, you will not stumble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Shaddai be your treasure, and precious silver for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Lord will be your trust; He will keep your feet from being caught.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;The letters of your excellency the illustrious Sheikh, my lord, have arrived&mdash;may God prolong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your &nbsp;life and make permanent your honored position, rank, loftiness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>excellence, highness and ascendancy. May He never deprive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your dwelling-place and court of any good. May He protect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all He has conferred upon you. May He subdue those that are envious of you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and crush your enemies. I was glad when I looked at your letter, and then I read it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>full of happiness. &ldquo;It was like water on a thirsty land&rdquo; (Prov. 25:25 and Ps. 143:6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I was like one that finds much spoil&rdquo; (cf. Ps. 119:162). It was reassuring for me to learn from it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about your well-being and your satisfactory state. Then I praised God for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this very much and asked Him to give you more of all the best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in His mercy. I, your servant, have taken note of your remark,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord, of&nbsp;how little I had written you, my lord, last</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>year. I, your servant, wish&nbsp;to inform you that I had (sent) {lit., &lsquo;written&rsquo;} letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with Sheikh&nbsp;Abū ʿAbd Allāh b. Abu &rsquo;l-Katāʾib,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and a consignment as well, to&nbsp;you, my lord, from me, your servant, in the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jurbattanī, the ship&nbsp;of the Sultan. You know,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my master, what happened to it. Thus, the letters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the consignment entrusted to him were lost. In the&nbsp;ship</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in which Sheikh Abū Zikrī Ibn al-Shāmī traveled (I had sent)&nbsp;letters to notify you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about the consignment sent with Sheikh Abū ʿAbd Allah b. Abu &rsquo;l-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Katāʾib. However, this ship, too, suffered what</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you know. For I, your servant, enquired about you,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord,&nbsp;and learned {lit., &lsquo;and they told me&rsquo;} that your house and your children&nbsp;were in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jurbattan. Therefore, I sent the things with the above&nbsp;mentioned.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As to the news concerning your brother Mevasser&mdash;he is well, but&nbsp;has not arrived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I shall act in this matter {alt. tr.: concerning him}, as&nbsp;you advised, my lord.&nbsp;Concerning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the forty dinars transmitted by Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maḍmūn&nbsp;through Sheikh Abū Naṣr b. Elisha,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no information; I do&nbsp;not know whether he (Mevasser) received something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or not.&nbsp;There arrived what you, my lord, kindly sent, namely the three&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>qaṣa-bowls, the water skin with lemon, the ginger, and the basket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with pepper and ginger. I received all this and thank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you, my lord,&nbsp;for your kindness and effort in this matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God reward you,&nbsp;my master, and satisfy your needs {alt. tr.: undertake your compensation},&nbsp;and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may I never {lit., &lsquo;may He never let me&rsquo;} miss you!&nbsp;As to excusing you, my lord, for not being able to purchase the new</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>betel nuts&mdash;you, my lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are excused, for all the travelers&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arrived and told the same story.&nbsp;I, your servant, sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with Sheikh Abū ʿAlī Ibn al-Ḥalla to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manj&lt;ar&gt;ūr two bottles of sugar, two bottles of raisins, and a bottle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of almonds, a total of five bottles. The bottle with almonds was &nbsp;filled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with sugar, for it had a little empty space; therefore, I filled it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with sugar. I, your servant, sent you also with the above</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentioned&nbsp;(Abū ʿAlī) half a pound of vitriol, half a pound of chewing gum,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ten sheets of white paper and a pound of costus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could not&nbsp;get hold of arsenic in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the market; otherwise, I would have sent it to&nbsp;you, my lord {alt. tr.: but it will reach you (later), my lord}.&nbsp;Please, my master,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>receive for your esteemed self the best greetings&nbsp;from me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to my lords, your children&mdash;may God let you&nbsp;enjoy their being alive {alt. tr.: give you pleasure with them throughout&nbsp;your life}!&mdash;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and to Sheikh Bama the best greetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And&nbsp;your servants, my children, send you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your children the best&nbsp;greetings. And Peace.</p>
