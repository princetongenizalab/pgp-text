My lord, the most illustrious Sheikh—may God prolong your life!— this is to inform you 
that your sons are well and in good health. They sent
for you with me something and instructed me to divide it for you into three
installments. Now, I beg you to inform me with whom I should send it to you,
and you need no instructions. For your information: the unpacking cost
one dirhem. Profuse greetings to you.

verso, address

To the Sheikh, the cantor,
Mevassēr’s brother,
known as Ibn Yijū.
