I, your servant, acknowledge your words of condolence over the death of my late
father—may he find mercy! I never doubted your friendship, Sheikh Abū Isḥāq, 
and know well that what happened at your place {alt. tr.: with you} is like what happened 
with us. Those two young men, the sons of Mūsā, namely 
Judah and Hārūn, journeyed to Broach, but the ship was struck in the Khawr (the gulf ); 
the two young men perished together with Sheikh Abu ’l-Faraj al-Maḥallī. God forbid 
that we should be forgetful of them! Furthermore, the death of my mother occurred this year 
in the month of Av; thus, even more grief  befell me. However, at all times 
everything is governed by God, the Exalted. He can do anything He pleases; 
and none can say to Him, “What are You doing?” May God, the Exalted, turn all matters to a good end! There 
arrived the ‘eggs’ and the ‘refurbished’ iron, which were sent in the ship of Ibn Abu 
’l-Katā'ib. Many thanks for your kindness. There arrived also four 
copper lids;  they are very heavy. I had wanted 
lighter ones. The betel nuts, which you, my lord, kindly sent with Sheikh 
Abu ’l-Surūr and Muwaffaq al-'Ashā'irī arrived. May God reward you well, 
my lord, and undertake to give you recompense and never let me want for you life! As to the cardamom, 
which you, my lord, mentioned had been delayed this year, do not worry about it, my lord.
I talked with my lord, the most illustrious Sheikh Maḍmūn and suggested 
to him to write about it to Ibn al-Marīḍa and to the Fidyār. 
But he said that you had already made the same suggestion {lit., ‘mentioned this’} in your letter to him. You
inquired in your letter, my lord, about the frying pan. (As a matter of fact) I
had forgotten it in my house on that day and did not send it. God, the Exalted, made it possible for me to forward 
to you for your household two bottles of raisins, a sieve, and two stone pans, 
both in one case, and a pound of Maghrebi kohl. Please, my master, take delivery
and forgive me (for not sending more). You ordered twenty bowls {alt. tr.: cups} and four lamps.
By my faith, I paid for this in advance two months before the sailing of the ships.
However, it happened that my lord, Sheikh Maḍmūn, and Sheikh Bilāl
were outfitting a boat {add: that belonged to them} for Ceylon in partnership and sent the attendants to set aside all that 
was being manufactured, so that they could take whatever they needed. Until the moment I wrote this letter, they
were promising some of it. If I get some, I, your servant, shall send it and add a note about it at 
the end of the letter. Making a bold demand on your kindness, I sent 
five manns of silk—of that silk. I was forced to do so, because of 
the devaluation of the Malikī (dinar); and by chance I had no {alt. tr.: and I did not succeed in acquiring} mithqāls, the price of which is here 
higher even than last year. Please, my master, just sell it for whatever God,
the Exalted, apportions and with its proceeds buy for me, your servant, a little pepper or ‘eggs’ and betel nuts 
and cardamom. However, do not buy for me ‘standard,’ //shiny// or refurbished iron, 
even for one dinar or one dirhem. But, if you happen {alt. tr.: are able} to get smooth iron, packed 
in bārbazās {alt. tr.: in containers with ventilation},  it will be all right. For when there are vapors, the iron becomes 
rusty. Thus, please do not buy me, your servant, standard, <<shiny 
or>> refurbished iron, but only smooth, long (bars) or pepper and 'eggs,'
betel nuts and cardamom. Please hire for these wares some space (in a ship), even if it is expensive, 
either from a shipowner or a captain or if you happen to find [merchants, who are], 
trustworthy, even if the rental is expensive. Do not cause me a delay [...]
whatever God, the Exalted, apportions; do not delay selling it [. . . as soon as] 
you, my lord, have taken delivery, and when you buy, [my] lo[rd...] 
even if it is expensive. There is no need, my master, [to give you advice. A hint is sufficient to a] 
wise man. Accept, my lord, for your es[teemed self the best greetings].
And best regards to my lord, your son, and Sheikh [Bama and those embraced]
by your care. And peace.
I acquired thirteen bowls and two lamps and th[ey are in such or such a package. I sent]
the silk, the sieve and the [Maghrebi] kohl [with Muwaffaq al-]
'Ashā'irī; and the two bottles [of raisins and the two stone pots]
in the ship of Ibn al-Muqaddam [with ...]
Please assist them, [my] lo[rd...
