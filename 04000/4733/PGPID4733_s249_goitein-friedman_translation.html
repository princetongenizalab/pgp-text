                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I, your servant, acknowledge your words of condolence over the death of my late</li>
<li>father&mdash;may he find mercy! I never doubted your friendship, Sheikh Abū Isḥāq,</li>
<li>and know well that what happened at your place {alt. tr.: with you} is like what happened</li>
<li>with us. Those two young men, the sons of Mūsā, namely</li>
<li>Judah and Hārūn, journeyed to Broach, but the ship was struck in the Khawr (the gulf );</li>
<li>the two young men perished together with Sheikh Abu &rsquo;l-Faraj al-Maḥallī. God forbid</li>
<li>that we should be forgetful of them! Furthermore, the death of my mother occurred this year</li>
<li>in the month of Av; thus, even more grief befell me. However, at all times</li>
<li>everything is governed by God, the Exalted. He can do anything He pleases;</li>
<li>and none can say to Him, &ldquo;What are You doing?&rdquo; May God, the Exalted, turn all matters to a good end! There</li>
<li>arrived the &lsquo;eggs&rsquo; and the &lsquo;refurbished&rsquo; iron, which were sent in the ship of Ibn Abu</li>
<li>&rsquo;l-Katā'ib. Many thanks for your kindness. There arrived also four</li>
<li>copper lids; they are very heavy. I had wanted</li>
<li>lighter ones. The betel nuts, which you, my lord, kindly sent with Sheikh</li>
<li>Abu &rsquo;l-Surūr and Muwaffaq al-'Ashā'irī arrived. May God reward you well,</li>
<li>my lord, and undertake to give you recompense and never let me want for you life! As to the cardamom,</li>
<li>which you, my lord, mentioned had been delayed this year, do not worry about it, my lord.</li>
<li>I talked with my lord, the most illustrious Sheikh Maḍmūn and suggested</li>
<li>to him to write about it to Ibn al-Marīḍa and to the Fidyār.</li>
<li>But he said that you had already made the same suggestion {lit., &lsquo;mentioned this&rsquo;} in your letter to him. You</li>
<li>inquired in your letter, my lord, about the frying pan. (As a matter of fact) I</li>
<li>had forgotten it in my house on that day and did not send it. God, the Exalted, made it possible for me to forward</li>
<li>to you for your household two bottles of raisins, a sieve, and two stone pans,</li>
<li>both in one case, and a pound of Maghrebi kohl. Please, my master, take delivery</li>
<li>and forgive me (for not sending more). You ordered twenty bowls {alt. tr.: cups} and four lamps.</li>
<li>By my faith, I paid for this in advance two months before the sailing of the ships.</li>
<li>However, it happened that my lord, Sheikh Maḍmūn, and Sheikh Bilāl</li>
<li>were outfitting a boat {add: that belonged to them} for Ceylon in partnership and sent the attendants to set aside all that</li>
<li>was being manufactured, so that they could take whatever they needed. Until the moment I wrote this letter, they</li>
<li>were promising some of it. If I get some, I, your servant, shall send it and add a note about it at</li>
<li>the end of the letter. Making a bold demand on your kindness, I sent</li>
<li>five manns of silk&mdash;of that silk. I was forced to do so, because of</li>
<li>the devaluation of the Malikī (dinar); and by chance I had no {alt. tr.: and I did not succeed in acquiring} mithqāls, the price of which is here</li>
<li>higher even than last year. Please, my master, just sell it for whatever God,</li>
<li>the Exalted, apportions and with its proceeds buy for me, your servant, a little pepper or &lsquo;eggs&rsquo; and betel nuts</li>
<li>and cardamom. However, do not buy for me &lsquo;standard,&rsquo; //shiny// or refurbished iron,</li>
<li>even for one dinar or one dirhem. But, if you happen {alt. tr.: are able} to get smooth iron, packed</li>
<li>in bārbazās {alt. tr.: in containers with ventilation}, it will be all right. For when there are vapors, the iron becomes</li>
<li>rusty. Thus, please do not buy me, your servant, standard, &lt;&lt;shiny</li>
<li>or&gt;&gt; refurbished iron, but only smooth, long (bars) or pepper and 'eggs,'</li>
<li>betel nuts and cardamom. Please hire for these wares some space (in a ship), even if it is expensive,</li>
<li>either from a shipowner or a captain or if you happen to find [merchants, who are],</li>
<li>trustworthy, even if the rental is expensive. Do not cause me a delay [...]</li>
<li>whatever God, the Exalted, apportions; do not delay selling it [. . . as soon as]</li>
<li>you, my lord, have taken delivery, and when you buy, [my] lo[rd...]</li>
<li>even if it is expensive. There is no need, my master, [to give you advice. A hint is sufficient to a]</li>
<li>wise man. Accept, my lord, for your es[teemed self the best greetings].</li>
<li>And best regards to my lord, your son, and Sheikh [Bama and those embraced]</li>
<li>by your care. And peace.</li>
<li>I acquired thirteen bowls and two lamps and th[ey are in such or such a package. I sent]</li>
<li>the silk, the sieve and the [Maghrebi] kohl [with Muwaffaq al-]</li>
<li>'Ashā'irī; and the two bottles [of raisins and the two stone pots]</li>
<li>in the ship of Ibn al-Muqaddam [with ...]</li>
<li>Please assist them, [my] lo[rd...</li>

                        <p>Excuse me, your servant, for not sending sugar. There is none to be had this year; and you, my master, are disposed to forgiving. Together with this letter is a letter for Sheikh Isaac Tilimsānī. Please deliver it to him without delay. </p>
