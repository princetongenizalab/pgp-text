Recto

In Your name, O Merciful.
This is my letter to you, my dear, nob[le] brother and lord [. . .],
may God prolong your life and preserve you and keep you! May he unite us in the near future
in the best of circumstances, fulfilling our happiest hopes in His grace and favor, for He
is omnipotent! You will be pleased to know that I had sent
you (pl.) a number of letters, which, however, came into the possession of Mevasser, who did not make the effort
to forward them to you. Then, he came to Aden, and I exerted myself for him
beyond my ability, until I found out that I had gotten myself into trouble {alt. tr.: beyond my ability, and he had found me immediately after (I had suffered) a disaster}.
However, it would take too much time to explain my experience with him {alt. tr.: The details of my story would take up too much space}. Now, my brother, it has pleased
God, the Exalted, to ordain my safe arrival in Fustat—
Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love—and I have already heard that [you have a grown son . . .] {alt. tr.: [you have three sons, the eldest]}
who is learned in Torah, and two other sons. [I am in the possession of  x thousand and x]
hundred dinars and am welloff {alt. tr.: [I lost  ] hundred dinars, but remain prosperous}. [. . . Out in India]
two children {alt. tr.: boys} were born to me, (pleasant) as the twigs of sweet basil. {Add: [The younger died in India.]}

The firstborn {alt. tr.: the older} died in Aden [. . .]


I have no words to describe him [. . .]


I have left a daughter, his {read: their} sister, li[ke . . . She will receive]


all my money. Now by God [when my letter arrives,]


send your [eldest] son [. . .]


so that we {alt. tr.: I} have joy from her and from him and marry [them . . . While]


in Aden, Sheikh Khalaf b. Bundār [had asked me for her hand] for his son, and she stayed


three years in their house. However, I called the engagement off, when I heard


about your son Surūr, because I said: “My brother’s son has more rights (to her) {alt. tr.: is more deserving} than


strangers.” When I brought her to Egypt {alt. tr.: Fustat}, many


asked me for her hand. I am writing you this, so that you should know.


Saying less about this would have been enough. I sent you with Sulaymān


b. Siṭrūn a bale {alt. tr.: bag} (shikāra), called ṣurra, containing pepper


and ginger, in a mixture, weighing exactly one qinṭār and fifteen raṭl.


May God ordain that it arrives safely and comes into your hand //safely//! However, do not


deal with it as you did with the pepper, which I had sent


you and which you lost through incompetence. Your letters to me should reach me


in Fustat, God willing. Let your son Surūr


carry the letters. Were it not now the time of the sailing


of the Salībiyya (winds), I would have sent more for you [[and sons]]


and your sons. Sulaymān and Abraham will explain to you my situation and the troubles I


Recto, right margin 
have {lit., ‘my heart’s troubles’}. As to Mevasser, he is not a man, he is indolent, possessed of a hard heart. I gave him all he needed, although I got into trouble (through him) {alt. tr.: I had just suffered a disaster}.  By these lines {alt. tr.: because, by these lines}, I {add: had} lost one thousand and forty dinars and suffered also losses on my way to Fustat, six hundred dinars.
Verso


Receive for your noble self the best greetings, and to your [[two]] three sons—


may God preserve them!—the best greetings, and she who is with you, their mother, is greeted by me


with the best greetings.
