<li>In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>This is my letter to you, my dear, nob[le] brother and lord [. . .],</li>
<li>may God prolong your life and preserve you and keep you! May he</li>
<li>unite us in the near future (4) in the best of circumstances, ful lling our</li>
<li>happiest hopes in His grace and favor, for He (5) is omnipotent!5</li>
<li>You will be pleased to know6 that I had sent (6) you (pl.) a number of</li>
<li>letters, which, however, came into the possession of Mevass r, who did</li>
<li>not make the effort (7) to forward them to you. Then, he came to Aden,</li>
<li>and I exerted myself for him (8) beyond my ability, until I found out that</li>
<li>I had gotten myself into trouble {alt. tr.: beyond my ability, and he had</li>
<li>found me immediately after (I had suffered) a disaster}.7 (9) However, it</li>

                        <h3>Recto, right margin </h3>

<li>
<p>As to Mevasser, he is not a man,38 he is indolent, possessed of a hard39</p>
<p>heart. I gave him all he needed, although I got into trouble (through him)</p>
<p>{alt. tr.: I had just suffered a disaster}.40 By these lines {alt. tr.: because, by</p>
<p>these lines},41 I {add: had} lost one thousand and forty dinars42 and suffered</p>
<p>also losses43 on my way to Fustat, six hundred dinars.</p>
