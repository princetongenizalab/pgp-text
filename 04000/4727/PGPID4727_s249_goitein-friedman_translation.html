<li>In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>This is my letter to you, my dear, nob[le] brother and lord [. . .],</li>
<li>may God prolong your life and preserve you and keep you! May he&nbsp;unite us in the near future</li>
<li>in the best of circumstances, fulfilling our&nbsp;happiest hopes in His grace and favor, for He</li>
<li>is omnipotent!&nbsp;You will be pleased to know that I had sent</li>
<li>you (pl.) a number of&nbsp;letters, which, however, came into the possession of Mevasser, who did&nbsp;not make the effort</li>
<li>to forward them to you. Then, he came to Aden,&nbsp;and I exerted myself for him</li>
<li>beyond my ability, until I found out that&nbsp;I had gotten myself into trouble {alt. tr.: beyond my ability, and he had&nbsp;found me immediately after (I had suffered) a disaster}.</li>
<li>However, it would take too much time to explain my experience with him {alt. tr.: The details of my story would take up too much space}. Now, my brother, it has pleased</li>
<li>God, the Exalted, to ordain my safe&nbsp;arrival in Fustat&mdash;</li>
<li>Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love&mdash;and I&nbsp;have already heard that [you have a grown son . . .] {alt. tr.: [you have three&nbsp;sons, the eldest]}</li>
<li>who is learned in Torah, and two other sons. [I am&nbsp;in the possession of  x thousand and x]</li>
<li>hundred dinars and am welloff&nbsp;{alt. tr.: [I lost  ] hundred dinars, but remain prosperous}. [. . . Out&nbsp;in India]</li>
<li>two children {alt. tr.: boys} were born to me, (pleasant)&nbsp;as the twigs of sweet basil. {Add: [The younger died in India.]}</li>
<li>
<p>The firstborn {alt. tr.: the older} died in Aden [. . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no words&nbsp;to describe him [. . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have left a daughter, his {read: their} sister,&nbsp;li[ke . . . She will receive]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all my money. Now by God [when my&nbsp;letter arrives,]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>send your [eldest] son [. . .]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so that we {alt. tr.:&nbsp;I} have joy from her and from him and marry [them . . . While]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Aden, Sheikh Khalaf b. Bundār [had asked me for her hand] for his son, and she stayed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three years in their house. However, I called&nbsp;the engagement off, when I heard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about your son Surūr, because&nbsp;I said: &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s son has more rights (to her) {alt. tr.: is more deserving}&nbsp;than</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strangers.&rdquo; When I brought her to Egypt {alt. tr.: Fustat},&nbsp;many</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>asked me for her hand. I am writing you this, so that you&nbsp;should know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saying less about this would have been enough.&nbsp;I sent you with Sulaymān</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>b. Siṭrūn a bale {alt. tr.: bag} (shikāra),&nbsp;called ṣurra, containing pepper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and ginger, in a mixture, weighing&nbsp;exactly one qinṭār and fifteen raṭl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God ordain that it arrives&nbsp;safely and comes into your hand //safely//! However, do not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deal&nbsp;with it as you did with the pepper, which I had sent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you and which you lost through incompetence.&nbsp;Your letters to me should reach me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in Fustat, God willing. Let&nbsp;your son Surūr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carry the letters. Were it not now the time of the&nbsp;sailing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the Salībiyya (winds), I would have sent more for you&nbsp;[[and sons]]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and your sons. Sulaymān and Abraham will explain&nbsp;to you my situation and the troubles I</p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <p>have {lit., &lsquo;my heart&rsquo;s&nbsp;troubles&rsquo;}.&nbsp;As to Mevasser, he is&nbsp;not&nbsp;a man,&nbsp;he is&nbsp;indolent, possessed of a hard&nbsp;heart. I gave him all he needed, although I got into trouble (through him) {alt. tr.: I had just suffered a disaster}. &nbsp;By these lines {alt. tr.: because, by&nbsp;these lines}, I {add: had} lost one thousand and forty dinars and suffered&nbsp;also losses on my way to Fustat, six hundred dinars.</p>
