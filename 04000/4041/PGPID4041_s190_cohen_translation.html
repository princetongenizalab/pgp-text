<p>My elder, the head, my master, may He (God) perpetuate your honor. I am from Qayrawan, one of the merchants. I am writing you this petition out of dire necessity. I came to Fustat and turned to a man called Nahray, who is my relative, my flesh and blood, and whom I respect. I have been with him now for eight months. Before that, when my master the elder Ab큰 Zikr카, may God grant him long life, arrived, I went to him and greeted him. Some people told him about my situation, and he was not stingy with charitable gifts for me, may God requite him with go[o]d on my behalf and watch over his son. Nahray became very annoyed over this and [asked me, "W]hy did you do this?" So I swore to him that not take anythin[g] from anyone [...] with you. Now, during the entire eight months the man gave me only [f]ifteen dirhems. When I told the Maghrebis about this they were troubled and were not stingy with me. I am embarrassed about speaking to the elder Ab큰 Zikr카, may God protect him from harm, so 1 am writing this petition to my master the elder asking from God and you to favor your slave and prot&eacute;g&eacute; by doing for me what you can. And may the welfare of my master increase forever.&nbsp;</p>
