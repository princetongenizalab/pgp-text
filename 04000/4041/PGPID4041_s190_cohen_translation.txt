"You love righteousness and hate wickedness; rightly [has God, your God, chosen to] a[noint you] with oil of gladness over all your peers" (Psalm 45:8). "And decree and it will be fulfilled, and light will shine [upon your affairs]" (Job 22:28). 
 
My elder, the head, my master, may He (God) perpetuate your honor. I am from Qayrawan, one of the merchants. I am writing you this petition out of dire necessity. I came to Fustat and turned to a man called Nahray, who is my relative, my flesh and blood, and whom I respect. I have been with him now for eight months. Before that, when my master the elder Abū Zikrī, may God grant him long life, arrived, I went to him and greeted him. Some people told him about my situation, and he was not stingy with charitable gifts for me, may God requite him with go[o]d on my behalf and watch over his son. Nahray became very annoyed over this and [asked me, "W]hy did you do this?" So I swore to him that not take anythin[g] from anyone [...] with you. Now, during the entire eight months the man gave me only [f]ifteen dirhems. When I told the Maghrebis about this they were troubled and were not stingy with me. I am embarrassed about speaking to the elder Abū Zikrī, may God protect him from harm, so 1 am writing this petition to my master the elder asking from God and you to favor your slave and protégé by doing for me what you can. And may the welfare of my master increase forever.
