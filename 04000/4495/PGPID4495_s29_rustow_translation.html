                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>I am writing to you, my lord and master, may God prolong your existence and make eternal your glory, from</li>
<li>al-Quds (Jerusalem), may God rebuild it. My health is good, praise and be to God for his</li>
<li>benefactions. God the exalted knows the anxiety I feel at your news and how</li>
<li>troubled I was collecting the debt owed to you.&nbsp; But God the exalted&nbsp;</li>
<li>replaces and compensates. But don't let it worry you: I plan to return</li>
<li>to the blessed al-Quds, and the holy one, blessed be he, will not let me perish.</li>
<li>You know, my lord, what Barizillay said: "Let your servant go back</li>
<li>etc. (and let me die in my own town, near the graves of my father and mother, 2 Sam. 19:39)." As far as livelihood is concerned, it's not a matter of willing it to happen.&nbsp;</li>
<li>You're aware of what the man of God, peace be upon him, said: "The race is not&nbsp;</li>
<li>won by the swift etc (Nor the battle by the valiant; Nor is bread won by the wise, Nor wealth by the intelligent, Nor favor by the learned. For the time of mischance comes to all." Ecclesiastes 9:11)." You know everything that has been said</li>
<li>about it, may God keep you. At the moment, I am (writing about) something else:&nbsp;</li>
<li>a debt that Thābit owes me, which would take too long to explain. I collected five</li>
<li>dinars, among them two full dinars, and the rest Sicilian quarter-dinars,</li>
<li>some good, some old and clipped. If I could agree with someone right now</li>
<li>to send them to you, I would send them, since It's not the kind of thing</li>
<li>for which one writes a suftaja. I'd like to send them to al-Arrajānī&nbsp;</li>
<li>and subtract something from them and take a suftaja for the amount, if a letter from you arrives</li>
<li>to that effect. He said that he has a partnershp (muʿāmala) with R. Avraham b. Yiṣḥaq</li>
<li>ha-Talmid. As for what you said to me about the situation (of Hiba),&nbsp;</li>
<li>if he were present in al-Quds, I would bring him him and force him&nbsp;</li>
<li>to withdraw the money for you, and I would collect it from him. But&nbsp;</li>
<li>he's not here &mdash; he's away in Zughrar. I asked someone to write to my lord</li>
<li>the ḥaver R. ʿAlī to help me rescue your property, and also</li>
<li>to my lord Abū Isḥaq Ibrāhīm, masos ha-yeshiva, may God protect him.</li>
<li>So please wait for whatever will happen and I'll keep you posted. I also wrote</li>
<li>to my lord Abū Isḥaq Barhūn son of Moshe he-ḥaver, may he rest in peace,&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

                        <ol>
<li>to the same effect, may God the exalted support you. Enclosed in this letter</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>is a letter to my lord Abū l-Faraj Hiba al-Kohen, may God protect him.</li>
<li>Please give it to him. If he's in the Rīf, please send it</li>
<li>to him. Do not put off writing to me about everything that's creating stress (?).</li>
<li>Perhaps my lord Abū l-Faraj Hibba can help you collect&nbsp;</li>
<li>the dinars. Answer me immediately. Everyone greets you with</li>
<li>best wishes and misses you. May God answer you with wellbeing</li>
<li>and may you be well, may your household be well, and may everything you have be well.</li>
<li>I received word that ʿImrān is putting the memory of our lord the gaʾon&nbsp;</li>
<li>Shelomo, may the memory of the righteous be a blessing and have eternal life, in a bad light. What happened to him? He should alter his foul</li>
<li>path. "Also, mold is scattered over him, but he has taken no notice (Hosea 7:9)." What more can I say</li>
<li>about that? A covenant of peace.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
                    
                        <h3>Verso - address</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>To my lord Abū Yaʿqūb Isḥaq b. Yaʿqūb the ḥaver</li>
<li>al-Maqdisī</li>
<li>may God prolong his existence and make [his glory] and support eternal</li>
<li>from Ḥayyim b. Salām</li>
<li>Fustat, if God [wills]</li>
<li>may it arrive in the Dār al-Ṣarf</li>
