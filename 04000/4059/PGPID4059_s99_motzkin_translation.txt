Recto


Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The lord will keep you from all evil.


The insignificant slave Solomon the teacher, son of Rabbi Elijah the Judge, (may he come to a) g(ood) e(nd),


informs the beneficent and gracious master, the pious and decent


friend, Abu'l-Fad'l - may his happiness last, and may he not deprive me


of his graciousness - and lets him know - may (God) grant him success - that (I) the slave do not cease to be grateful


for your kindness (to me). May God grant you success. I indorm you that (the time of) the poll-tax


is near at hand and I have been ruined by illness. Everything left


from my salary goes for medicines and chickens and the time for


the poll-tax has come. If my lord has some money


as an advance, be so kind as to allot it to (me) your slave;


it will be considered as a gift and a present, an act of graciousness and charity on your part.


May God on high open his treasures to you and reward you from his handful.


May he never shame you nor compel you to (beg from) a human being. Amen.

I beg your forgiveness for my ignorance. May God grant you success. Peace.
