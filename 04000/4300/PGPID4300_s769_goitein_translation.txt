Recto 


((Second [leaf])) 


I made a list of all the responsa I had 


and sent it two years ago, together with a letter, 


to Sheikh Abu Zikri b. [[Bū Wafa]] Hayyim b. Immanuel-may God always keep him - to show it to my lord, the Rav. 


Up till now I have not received an answer on this, nor do I know what has been done


with regard to the estate [of our master Berechiah]. Sheikh Abu Zikri charged 


me for the price of the books, which were bought for me out of the estate of our master 


Berechiah (of) b(lessed) m(emory) with 8 dinars. I sent him silver, which he sold for 


12 dinars. Whereupon I received a letter from him, in which he says that he


 would spend the balance due me on the price of what he [[has copied]] had ordered to copy for me, but he gave me no details about 


what was copied. I wrote him inquiring what [[he had copied]] he had ordered to copy, asking him to [[copy]] order to copy the Commentary on Hezqat ha- Battīm (Bava Qamma, ch. III) in the format I sent to him.


However, I did not receive a letter from him, either last year 


or this. I learned meanwhile that he had travelled to Spain, 


may God grant him a safe passage. I am suggesting now to my 


lord, the Rav, that you provide me with a list of the responsa 


from the estate of our master Berechiah (of) b(lessed) m(emory) and others, which you know that [you] do not have. 


I prepared a list of the questions, which I have and enclosed it 


in this letter of mine so that you (my lord, the Rav) take notice of it [[and act accordingly]] ((and provide me with it [the missing ones] accordingly)). 


[[I know that most of the books of our master Berechiah (of) b(lessed) m(emory) have been sold, 


but hope that the responsa have remained. If, however, God beware, 


the matter has been neglected, please find out everyone who bought some of this.


Please do me this favor.]] I was told that you, my lord, the Rav, bought 


[[most of them. If there is something to this, I am not too bashful to tell this 


to your excellency. For I know that... ((And I know that your gentlemanliness would induce you to do this on your own accord. I do not wish to say more in this matter)). 


And with regard to the books of R. Berechiah]]. As to the estate of Rabbenu Nissim


(the) m(emory of the) s(aint is) b(lessed). I am perplexed about it [...


When you, my lord, the Rav, bought for me [... 


the books, no hand was known to have touched them [... 


Notwithstanding, not all the estate came into your possession [...]
