and may He protect him, and permit him to witness the 
joy of his son, his learning, and length of days. 
Amen. Selah. [My desire to see you is such] that were I to express 
it entirely, scrolls would not suffice. [God] knows that [this] is true. May he rejoin
us in your presence on the most joyous of occasions. [. . . . . ] 
Aside from this, your servant received on [Wednesday] 21

our lord, our teacher Moses, may he live forever, who requested that your servant 
come as quickly as possible on his mount on account of his illness. 
May God, the exalted prevent harm from befalling the community because of him, and may He protect him.
