                        <ol><li>The Elders, the Kohanim, Rāḍī and Mufaḍḍal came (before us,) and Mufaḍḍal brought a document from the court of the (Muslim) notable</li><li>to the seat of his glorious excellency, Diadem of Beauty, our teacher and our master, our lord Abraham the great Nagid</li><li>the outstanding Rav, may his name endure forever, describing with verification what proceeded between the aforementioned (individuals).</li><li>A witness came—though he was a relative—stating that it was resolved between them without judgment or qinyan,</li><li>that Rāḍī would pay him the aforementioned amount mentioned in the Arabic document, a dinar and a half each month.</li><li>Mufaḍḍal said a number of times, “I have settled (the matter), and I renounced any proceedings in that aforementioned place (court),</li><li>regarding a settlement or distribution, and so forth.” Mufaḍḍal demanded that</li><li>Rāḍī pay him a dinar, (the total) amount (of the partnership) in silver being one thousand four hundred dirhams, payment of that to be</li><li>upon request and demand. Then he (Rāḍī) challenged him, and he had an Islamic document. Rāḍī responded to him, “If  this amount had been our sole responsibility, </li><li>this amount would have been the balance of my claim. However, we were three partners—he </li><li>and Ṭāhir and I—and neither Ṭāhir nor I had enough to pay it, and Mufḍḍal did not want to deal with</li><li>Ṭāhir, nor did he (Ṭāhir) deal with him (Mufaḍḍal), nor did he (Mufaḍḍal) lend to him (Ṭāhir), but I myself received this amount from him (Mufaḍḍal), and an Islamic document </li><li>was written for me concerning Ṭāhir by his agent. And we paid the remaining debts from that amount incumbent upon us.</li><li>I paid it and Mufaḍḍal received the amount I paid in full in hides from the tannery, their worth roughly</li><li>the 17, more or less—I am unable to verify its exact amount—and the balance of three remained as our responsibility.</li><li>Mufaḍḍal responded: “Out of all I have mentioned, none of the aforementioned hides nor any others have reached me, </li><li>nor have I received anything from the amount of this document, which is the balance in your possession up till now.” We wrote down that which proceeded</li><li>in this court between the two of them, in order that it would be a title of right and proof. This took place in the middle ten-day period</li><li>of the month of Adar II of the year 1543 of (the Era of) Documents, in the town of Mīnyat Ziftā the noble,</li><li>[jurisdiction of ] our [lord,] our Nagid, our master Abraham, the great Rav, may he live forever, amen, (for) eternity, selah.</li><li>[…] … […]</li><li>[…] Gamliel b. Simḥa (whose) s(oul is at) r(est)</li></ol>
