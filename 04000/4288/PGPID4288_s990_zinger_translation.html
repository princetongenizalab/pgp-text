                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>may God protect them for you. It has been some days now that Shabbat&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the girl (al-ṣabīya) quarreled, and he was on the verge of divorce. I did not cease to coax him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and his brothers gently, may God endow them with life. They spared no effort (in this matter). You must, may God protect you,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write to them and thank them for what they have done. I settled the matter&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as is desired. They are in complete blessing; calm your heart in this matter.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For I am here for you more than any brother and friend. For your favor is upon us&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and upon anyone who comes to Miṣr, may God make you stay this way forever.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bearer of this letter is a cantor from the people of al-Andalus, poor and exiled&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>from his land. He has children with him. We have provided (aṣlaḥnā) something small for him and he intends&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to go up to Miṣr. He is a modest and bashful (munqaṭiʿ al- lisān) person. He asked me&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to write on his behalf to a man with fear of heaven and industry. I could not think&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of anyone as fitting as my lord the elder, may God protect you. I ask you to act with him&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as is char- acteristic of you, as your beautiful custom has been with any passerby.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For he is deserving. Whatever you do // will be good // in your most excellent benefits. Speak&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to my lord, the excellent ḥaver, on his behalf so he can strive for him for&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>heaven&rsquo;s sake. Whatever need my lord and elder has, it will honor me&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to fulfill it. May you never deprive me of your letters, for I&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rejoice in them. I send you the best greetings of peace.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
                    
                        <h3>Recto, right-hand margins</h3>
                    
                        <p>and to your brothers, may God endow them with life, (I send) the utmost greetings of peace, and to my lord, Abū al-Faḍl the parnas, and to his child, greetings. My (paternal) uncle sends you greetings.</p>

<li>
<p>(This is) my letter (to you), may God prolong the life of my lord, the excellent elder, and make lasting his honor,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strength, happiness, and health. I have delayed my letters to&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my lord the elder all this time only due to (my) preference to alleviate the burden (of your having to answer back).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though (our) correspondence was irregular, whenever someone comes down (the Nile) from Fusṭāṭ,&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ask about your news, and he informs me about your health and the health of your sons,</p>
