                        <ol><li>we, the witnesses whose signature appears below—on Sunday, the twenty-first day of the month of Adar of the year one thousand</li><li>four hundred and eight years, according to the count to which we are accustomed, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, situated on the Nile River. Thus: the Elder Abū</li><li>al-Baqā (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Samuel b. (his) h(onor,) g(reatness, and) h(oliness) (o)ur tea(cher) and (o)ur master Nathan the Ḥaver (Fellow) of the gre(at) San(hedrin, who) r(ests in) E(den) and Mr. Nathaniel and M(r.) Aaron, the sons of Mr. Moses, known as the Elder Abū ‘Imrān,</li><li>[kn]own as … came before us. Mr. Nathaniel known as Abū al-Faraj and M(r.) Aaron known as Abū al-Barakāt, these sons of Mr. Moses (who) r(ests in) E(den), said to us, “Our father collaborated</li><li>with [the Elder A]bū al-Baqā, this Mr. Samuel, in merchandise totaling four hundred and eighty-four and a half din(ars), of which [t]his Elder Abū al-Baqā had </li><li>three hundred and sixty dinars of Fusṭāṭ standard weight as his capital, and the remainder of one hundred and twenty-four and a half din(ars) was the capital </li><li>[of o]ur [father] (who) r(ests in) E(den,) in order that he would travel with it to Shām, selling and buying. Upon his arrival, that which exalted God facilitated in terms of profit, after replenishment of the capital of</li><li>[the Elder A]bū al-Baqā and of our father, was to be split between the two of them evenly; likewise, if—God forbid—the opposite occurred. Our father traveled with the merchandise on [his] journey </li><li>[…] for him, he sold and bought, and he sent (it) here, to Fusṭāṭ, t[o the] agency [house] of our lord the glorious Qāḍī Abū al-Ṭāhir b. Rajā in accordance with the record of the partnersh[ip (khulṭa)… ]</li><li>[…the afore]mentioned […] which is five ship’s bales of linen and six qafīz of sugar, and a single bale of gallnuts, and a single bale of … […]</li><li>[…] … in Shām, also for the partnership (khulṭa), two bales of flax and thirty-eight garments deposited in our names […]</li><li>[…] … as well, allocated to the Elder Abū al-Baqā, a Siklatūn garment, and allocated to us […]</li><li>[…Tri]poli, and he received everything that was in the hand of Abū […]</li><li>[…] according to his capital, and he recie[ved …]</li><li>[…] to us in …[…]</li></ol>
