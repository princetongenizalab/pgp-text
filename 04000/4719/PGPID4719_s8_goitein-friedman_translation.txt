In Your name, O Merciful.
The letter of your excellency, the most illustrious elder, my lord, has arrived. It was the most pleasant letter that came and the most delightful
[message] that arrived. I read it with joy, examined it with delight, with gladness. I understood it, and was happy}

[to learn that] you were well and your affairs in order, for which I thanked God very much and asked Him, in His mercy, to give you more
of every good thing, God willing. There arrived, my master, what you have kindly sent,
namely, a basket with pepper and ginger, another basket with Manjal-turmeric, in which there was also a little ginger, and 3 qaṣʿa-bowls.
May God reward you well and satisfy your needs, and may you never cease to bestow kindness (on me)! However, the water skin with lemon and mango
arrived spoiled and stinking, and we threw them away. There arrived also the cardamom. I took
one fourth from Sheikh Maḍmūn, and he took three fourths. You mentioned, my lord,
that you would have the copper vessels that had been ordered made from the scrap. By God, do not postpone it
this year, for the matter is urgent. Do not delay any of the copper vessels, //that is// the shipments {alt. tr.: items}, which
I had mentioned to your excellency, for all this is very urgent. Please, my master, have a {add: another} look
at my previous letter from last year, and do no defer any of the shipments {alt. tr.: items} //of the copper vessels//.
By God, oblige (me by) this deed {alt. tr.: grant me this favor.}. The copper ordered for ⟦the sake of apprenticeship of⟧ //my son//
should be in a separate account. Please do not mix his account with mine.
For the balance of my {lit., ‘your servant’s’} account, please buy some betel nuts or, if that is not to be had,
pepper in one or two baskets, in order to save freight and customs duties in Aden. I sent to you,
my lord, for your esteemed household what has no value or importance, namely
an Alexandrian maqṭaʿ, a goat-wool fūṭa—your name is written on them—15 large sheets of Ṭalḥī-paper,
a brazilwood box with sugar, a brazilwood box with raisins and a brazilwood box with soap—large boxes,
on which is //written//: ‘Yijū, shipped by Joseph.’ I also sent you five pounds of costus, a half a pound
of kohl, an ounce of ladanum, a half a pound of vitriol and half a pound of samgh gum. These commodities are in a mazza.
All this is forwarded to you through the nākhudā Maḥrūz. May God ordain his safe arrival! May my lord receive for his esteemed
self the best greetings! And may my lord be blessed with peace!
