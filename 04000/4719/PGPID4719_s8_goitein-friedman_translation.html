<li>In Your name, O Merciful.</li>
<li>The letter of your excellency, the most illustrious elder, my lord, has arrived. It was the most pleasant letter that came and the most delightful</li>
<li>[message] that arrived. I read it with joy, examined it with delight, with gladness. I understood it, and was happy}</li>

<li>[to learn that] you were well and your affairs in order, for which I thanked God very much and asked Him, in His mercy, to give you more</li>
<li>of every good thing, God willing. There arrived, my master, what you have kindly sent,</li>
<li>namely, a basket with pepper and ginger, another basket with Manjal-turmeric, in which there was also a little ginger, and 3 qaṣʿa-bowls.</li>
<li>May God reward you well and satisfy your needs, and may you never cease to bestow kindness (on me)! However, the water skin with lemon and mango</li>
<li>arrived spoiled and stinking, and we threw them away. There arrived also the cardamom. I took</li>
<li>one fourth from Sheikh Maḍmūn, and he took three fourths. You mentioned, my lord,</li>
<li>that you would have the copper vessels that had been ordered made from the scrap. By God, do not postpone it</li>
<li>this year, for the matter is urgent. Do not delay any of the copper vessels, //that is// the shipments {alt. tr.: items}, which</li>
<li>I had mentioned to your excellency, for all this is very urgent. Please, my master, have a {add: another} look</li>
<li>at my previous letter from last year, and do no defer any of the shipments {alt. tr.: items} //of the copper vessels//.</li>
<li>By God, oblige (me by) this deed {alt. tr.: grant me this favor.}. The copper ordered for ⟦the sake of apprenticeship of⟧ //my son//</li>
<li>should be in a separate account. Please do not mix his account with mine.</li>
<li>For the balance of my {lit., ‘your servant’s’} account, please buy some betel nuts or, if that is not to be had,</li>
<li>pepper in one or two baskets, in order to save freight and customs duties in Aden. I sent to you,</li>
<li>my lord, for your esteemed household what has no value or importance, namely</li>
<li>an Alexandrian maqṭaʿ, a goat-wool fūṭa—your name is written on them—15 large sheets of Ṭalḥī-paper,</li>
<li>a brazilwood box with sugar, a brazilwood box with raisins and a brazilwood box with soap—large boxes,</li>
<li>on which is //written//: ‘Yijū, shipped by Joseph.’ I also sent you five pounds of costus, a half a pound</li>
<li>of kohl, an ounce of ladanum, a half a pound of vitriol and half a pound of samgh gum. These commodities are in a mazza.</li>
<li>All this is forwarded to you through the nākhudā Maḥrūz. May God ordain his safe arrival! May my lord receive for his esteemed</li>
<li>self the best greetings! And may my lord be blessed with peace!</li>
