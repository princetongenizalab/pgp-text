Please explain our situation
to our lord, the Rayyis—may God preserve him! Perhaps he will write for us a letter to 
the Commander Mubashshir, the fatā, to Sheikh Ben Sāliḥ—may God preserve him!—to the Doctor, 
and to the Muslim commander of Mazara. Perhaps our trip will come about this way,
so that we may board a ship. He will supply us with provisions as well as our costs for 
the boat fare, which he will collect from us in Alexandria. Either I shall hold on to
hope {lit., ‘I shall calm my heart’} or I shall go mad. God give me power of endurance {alt. tr.: comfort me} through you three being alive,
and may He fulfill, with regard to you, the verse: “A threefold cord is not readily broken,” and may he increase
your well-being! Amen. And a letter to the congregation against
Ibn Mubashshir, concerning the gold we gave him, for he did
not return anything to us, claiming that it was lost {alt. tr.: that he was destitute}, nor did he rent {lit., ‘give us lodging in’} a house for us,
nor did he give us anything. <<And a letter to Sheikh Abu ʾl-Faraj Ibn Masnūt—may he see the days of the Messiah!—for had it not been for him, Ḥajjāj would not have paid us a thing.>> Be not remiss, perhaps we shall succeed. Why should we
stretch out our hands (for alms)? {Alt. tr.: Be not remiss. Perhaps we will be able to put our hands on something.}
