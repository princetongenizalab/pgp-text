<li>Please explain our situation</li>
<li>to our lord, the Rayyis—may God preserve him! Perhaps he will write for us a letter to </li>
<li>the Commander Mubashshir, the fatā, to Sheikh Ben Sāliḥ—may God preserve him!—to the Doctor, </li>
<li>and to the Muslim commander of Mazara. Perhaps our trip will come about this way,</li>
<li>so that we may board a ship. He will supply us with provisions as well as our costs for </li>
<li>the boat fare, which he will collect from us in Alexandria. Either I shall hold on to</li>
<li>hope {lit., ‘I shall calm my heart’} or I shall go mad. God give me power of endurance {alt. tr.: comfort me} through you three being alive,</li>
<li>and may He fulfill, with regard to you, the verse: “A threefold cord is not readily broken,” and may he increase</li>
<li>your well-being! Amen. And a letter to the congregation against</li>
<li>Ibn Mubashshir, concerning the gold we gave him, for he did</li>
<li>not return anything to us, claiming that it was lost {alt. tr.: that he was destitute}, nor did he rent {lit., ‘give us lodging in’} a house for us,</li>
<li>nor did he give us anything. &lt;&lt;And a letter to Sheikh Abu ʾl-Faraj Ibn Masnūt—may he see the days of the Messiah!—for had it not been for him, Ḥajjāj would not have paid us a thing.&gt;&gt; Be not remiss, perhaps we shall succeed. Why should we</li>
<li>stretch out our hands (for alms)? {Alt. tr.: Be not remiss. Perhaps we will be able to put our hands on something.}</li>
