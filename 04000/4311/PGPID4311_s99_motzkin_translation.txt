Recto


We were present, we the witnesses, when the following, explained in this


record, transpired, and we signed (this record) on the bottom (of it) on Wednesday, the seven-


teenth of Ada'r, One Thousand Five Hundred Thirty


Six, Seleucid Era, in Fust'a't', Cairo, which is situated on the Nile


River, licensed by our Master, our Prince, Abraham, the


expert rabbi, the great prince, may his glory be exalted and his honor increase, in


the bazaar of Cairo. In our hands were a dressing gown, a sleeved, ornate, white kerchief, and a veil


which the one who told us to auction it gave us; so we showed them


in the bazaar, after we consulted about what they should yield. We then gave them


to the auctioneer, who really endeavored (to sell them) in our presence


by crying out. The gown yielded forty dirhems in the auction,


the ornate sleeved kerchief - after subtracting agent's fees -


sixteen dirhems in the auction, while the veil, yieided one


and twenty dirhems in the auction. Altogether seventy-seven dirhems.


We returned them also to the auctioneer and he took out of them (what was coming to him).


They did not yield more than that. To this we affix our signatures.
