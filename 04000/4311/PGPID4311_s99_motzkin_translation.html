<li>
<p>We were present, we the witnesses, when the following, explained in this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>record, transpired, and we signed (this record) on the bottom (of it) on Wednesday, the seven-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teenth of Ada'r, One Thousand Five Hundred Thirty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six, Seleucid Era, in Fust'a't', Cairo, which is situated on the Nile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>River, licensed by our Master, our Prince, Abraham, the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expert rabbi, the great prince, may his glory be exalted and his honor increase, in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bazaar of Cairo. In our hands were a dressing gown, a sleeved, ornate, white kerchief, and a veil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which the one who told us to auction it gave us; so we showed them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the bazaar, after we consulted about what they should yield. We then gave them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the auctioneer, who really endeavored (to sell them) in our presence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by crying out. The gown yielded forty dirhems in the auction,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ornate sleeved kerchief - after subtracting agent's fees -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sixteen dirhems in the auction, while the veil, yieided one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and twenty dirhems in the auction. Altogether seventy-seven dirhems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We returned them also to the auctioneer and he took out of them (what was coming to him).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They did not yield more than that. To this we affix our signatures.</p>
</li>
