may God have mercy upon him.And Joseph did not cease to administer the affa(irs of the Alexandrian community until the times of) 


Joshia, the head of the yeshiva, may God be pleased with him and after the latter's (death in the times of Solomon, the Aaronite). 


And when Solomon, the Aaronite, the head of the yeshiva, died and the office passed (to Solomon b. Judah) 


of Fez, the present incumbent – may God increase his splendor –, he appointed Joseph, the Aaronite, (to be chief of the Rabbanite Jews) 


 in the port-city of Alexandria, namely as judge in all matters that he had administered up till then,(to wit,) decisions on 


their civil cases, the conclusion of marriages and the enactment of divorces in accordance with the rites of their denomination, the appointment of cantors (and officiating in) 


their synagogues, and of persons administering their emoluments, and the dismissal of anyone deserving it in his opinion. And when anyone opposes him, 


(no action can be taken against Joseph) except by the head of the yeshiva, who has appointed him and invested him with his authority. 


And when we were asked to testify by one who has authority to do so, we wrote this our testimony (.....) 


(...) and we signed for him and signed ourselves on the day...
