                        <ol>
<li>In Your name, O Merciful. His servant Joseph b. Abraham—may he rest in Eden!</li>
<li>I have sent to Sheikh Abraham b. Peraḥyā Yijū, through the agency of Sheikh Maymūn, the Muslim,</li>
<li>the {prominent} merchant, to Manjarūr, in the ship of the nākhudā Maḥrūz—may God ordain its safety {alt. tr.: safe arrival}!—</li>
<li>a bag containing copper, in which are four pieces of scrap, and a copper {ten-cornered} tray, weighing 41 ½</li>
<li>pounds, and a tall boiler, in a separate package, weighing 12 pounds. Total weight:</li>
<li>53 ½ pounds. If God decrees that it arrives safely, please have made for me</li>
<li>a {ten- cornered} tray the same size as the one sent to you and also a marfaʿ decorated with wickerwork {alt. tr.: filigree},</li>
<li>which we call zīr-khuwān (a table jug). It should fit into the center of the {ten-cornered} tray, so that when</li>
<li>water is poured into it from a water skin, the drops should fall on the {ten-cornered} tray {lit., ‘so that whatever water drips from the water skin above it should fall on the (ten-cornered) tray.’}.</li>
<li>The wickerwork decoration {alt. tr.: filigree} should be like that of a bamboo basket; the table jug should weigh eight pounds, more</li>
<li>or less, and the {ten-corned} tray about four pounds. Furthermore, a</li>
<li>small candlestick, weighing about three pounds, made in the form of steps; and a small tʾlm (?), whose</li>
<li>mouth should be no more than one and a half handbreadths, and whose ʾsbʾdr should be of fine workmanship. As to the remainder of the copper,</li>
<li>please sell it, and with its proceeds pay the craftsman’s fee. With the balance buy me, your servant, a small quantity of</li>
<li>fresh betel nuts, or, if they are not available, cardamom or tumeric. There was also sent</li>
<li>to your excellency an Indian basket with nineteen pounds of copper, four pieces</li>
<li>of scrap and a basin. I, your servant, was asked by my son to help him with this. However, I would like you to please</li>
<li>keep his account separate; it should not be entered in my account. Please have made from it for its owner</li>
<li>a basin and a ewer, both small, a small marfaʿ with nice bamboo wickerwork {alt. tr.: filigree, like bamboo wickerwork}.</li>
<li>He wishes to place it on a platter on the table. As to the remainder of the copper, please sell it for him</li>
<li>and use the proceeds to pay the craftsman’s fee. With the balance buy him a small quantity of betel nuts or cardamom.</li>

<li>There was dispatched to your excellency for your esteemed</li>
<li>household what has no importance and no value, namely a bottle of raisins; a rubāʿiyya of almonds and a rubāʿiyya of soap; an embroidered kerchief,</li>

<li>{woven in Aden; five dasts of Egyptian paper; half an ounce of civet; half a pound of kohl;</li>
<li>and half a pound of mastic gum. The kerchief, civet, paper, kohl and gum are</li>
<li>all in one piece of cloth, on which is written your excellency’s name. All of this is sent together with</li>
<li>the aforementioned Sheikh Maymūn. And peace.}</li>
