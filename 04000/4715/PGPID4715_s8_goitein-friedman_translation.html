<li>In Your name, O Merciful. </li>
<li>For the Lord will be your trust; He will keep your feet from being caught. You will decree and it will be fulfilled, etc.</li>
<li>My letter to my lord and master, the most illustrious sheikh—may God give you long life and make permanent your well-being!—</li>
<li>written in a state of well-being and good health, with strong longing for you. May God soon reunite me with you </li>
<li>in the best of circumstances, through His favor and grace, for He is omnipotent and trustworthy! </li>
<li>You will be pleased to know, my lord, that I arrived in complete safety at 'Aydhāb. </li>
<li>Let them praise the Lord for His steadfast love, etc. My lord, the little one, my daughter, cries day and night over</li>
<li>your (pl.) separation from her. May God facilitate //her// reunion with you—God willing—in the best of circumstances!</li>
<li>I am making a great effort to accomplish this. Were I able to make a sale in 'Aydhāb, I would sell and return.</li>
<li>But only what God decrees will come about. I have heard that you had mentioned that I owe you the balance</li>
<li>of an account and that the smaller packages left in the warehouse do not cover the sum. Your account, </li>
<li>my lord, is this: I owe you five dirhems, no more no less! You already made an accounting with me for it. </li>
<li>If there is good iron in the warehouse, which will cover the sum, after you kindly </li>
<li>give instructions to someone to sell the smaller packages left in the warehouse, fine. If your servant still owes something, I am not </li>
<li>running away. What I still owe is not worth talking about. I shall either arrive,</li>
<li>God willing, in Aden and pay you, or I shall send something of that value, or you can collect from </li>
<li>the nākhudā Ma'ālī or from my lord and master Sheikh Khalaf...
