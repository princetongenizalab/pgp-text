Testimony which was given before us, we the undersigned witnesses […]of the week, which was the twenty-sixth day of the month of Sivan, of the year one thousand and f[our hundred …]years, according  to the count to which we are accustomed, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt [situated] along the Nile [River.]Thus: the Elder Abū al-Faḍl Mr. Mevorakh the Parnas, Treasure of […] b. Mr. Abraham known as (I)bn Sabrī (who) r(ests in) E(den), and Mr. Moses Ha-Kohen, known as Abū ‘I[mrān b.]Mr. Mordecai ha-Kohen (may his) e(nd be) g(ood), appeared before us and said to us, “Testify [concerning us and perform] a qinyan with us from now o[n, write] and sign concerning us using all [the a]ppropriate legal formulae and the [expressions of certainty], and all the language of claims, and give that to each of us, in order that we would have proof and a legal document [from now] onthat the two of us attest before [you] in our good health and the freedom of will, [willingly,] with neither duress nor force [nor compulsion, with neither] negligence nor error, with neither illness [of dis]ease [among us], nor any of the fa[ctors which invalidate testim]ony, that we have a[sked the Creator,] may His Name be exalted, (for guidance,)collaborating [in the] specified [sho]p in […..] olives and otherthings.

At the end of this year, I will carry out my reckoning [in] what which the exalted Creator has facilitated in terms of profit. After subtracting all our capital, two thirds will be for me—I, Moses ha-Kohen;  a third will be for the Elder Abū al-Faḍl, this Mr. Mevorakh the Parnas.Likewise, God forbid, if there would be the opposite of profit at that time. Then, if (continuation of) the balance ofthe partnership (shirka) as we were is desired, we will continue; and if termination is desired, (Mevorakh) will wait for the eighty din(ars) of his money—for a period of two months he has no statement (on which to rely), thereafter he may take it. I, Moses ha-Kohen, have already stipulated concerning the Elder Abū al-Faḍl, this Mr. Mevorakh the Parnas, that I am to be treated as twoproper trustworthy witnesses in all that which I report in terms of profit. He has no rightto an oath of any other sort—simple or grave—from me therein, even rider oaths; but if, God forbid, our capital lessens whatsoever, adjudication between him and me will take placein this matter and neither of us may separate from the partnership during this year. Rather, each [of us] has obligated his partner till the end of this year which is the duration of the partnership (shirka).[…] Effective immediately, I, Moses ha-Kohen [have taken] upon myself trust in Heaven that[…th]e matters for all of us, and I will not remain obligated[…] all the profit which I received
