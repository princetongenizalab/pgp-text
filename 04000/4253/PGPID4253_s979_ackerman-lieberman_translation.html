Mr. Abraham known as (I)bn Sabrī (who) r(ests in) E(den), and Mr. Moses Ha-Kohen, known as Abū ‘I[mrān b.]</li><li>Mr. Mordecai ha-Kohen (may his) e(nd be) g(ood), appeared before us and said to us, “Testify [concerning us and perform] a qinyan with us from now o[n, write] </li><li>and sign concerning us using all [the a]ppropriate legal formulae and the [expressions of certainty], and all the language </li><li>of claims, and give that to each of us, in order that we would have proof and a legal document [from now] on</li><li>that the two of us attest before [you] in our good health and the freedom of will, [willingly,] with neither duress nor </li><li>force [nor compulsion, with neither] negligence nor error, with neither illness [of dis]ease [among us], nor any of the </li><li>fa[ctors which invalidate testim]ony, that we have a[sked the Creator,] may His Name be exalted, (for guidance,)</li><li>collaborating [in the] specified [sho]p in […..] olives and other</li><li>things.

At the end of this year, I will carry out my reckoning </li><li>[in] what which the exalted Creator has facilitated in terms of profit. After subtracting all our capital, two thirds </li><li>will be for me—I, Moses ha-Kohen;  a third will be for the Elder Abū al-Faḍl, this Mr. Mevorakh the Parnas.</li><li>Likewise, God forbid, if there would be the opposite of profit at that time. Then, if (continuation of) the balance of</li><li>the partnership (shirka) as we were is desired, we will continue; and if termination is desired, (Mevorakh) will wait for </li><li>the eighty din(ars) of his money—for a period of two months he has no statement (on which to rely), thereafter he may take it. I, Moses ha-Kohen, have already stipulated </li><li>concerning the Elder Abū al-Faḍl, this Mr. Mevorakh the Parnas, that I am to be treated as two</li><li>proper trustworthy witnesses in all that which I report in terms of profit. He has no right</li><li>to an oath of any other sort—simple or grave—from me therein, even </li><li>rider oaths; but if, God forbid, our capital lessens whatsoever, adjudication between him and me will take place</li><li>in this matter and neither of us may separate from the partnership during this year. Rather, each </li><li>[of us] has obligated his partner till the end of this year which is the duration of the partnership (shirka).</li><li>[…] Effective immediately, I, Moses ha-Kohen [have taken] upon myself trust in Heaven that</li><li>[…th]e matters for all of us, and I will not remain obligated</li><li>[…] all the profit which I received</li></ol>
