Recto


this year in the ship of ⟦Nbrdwy {or read: Nbyrwy}⟧ Fidyār. I sent with him {alt. tr.: wrote and sent with him} a letter of proxy,


{which I confirmed by witnesses; and the document} is (designated) “a letter of proxy against Abu ʾl-Faraj b. Mūsā


al-Baghdādī.” I did so as a matter of precaution. Now, may I, your servant, ask you a favor—may God make permanent


your honored position! If this young man is (still) with you, or has come back from Ceylon and is going to


Aden, let no one know that I sent a letter of proxy against him or against anyone else. Moreover, please tell Sheikh


Ḍāfir that in this case he should not undertake anything in the matter despite my instructions to him. However, if


—God forbid—he has deviated from the right path and has declared bankruptcy or intends to travel


to a place other than Aden, please inform Sheikh Ḍāfir to produce the letter of proxy against him in order to demand from him


what he owes. Sheikh Ḍāfir is a very busy man and perhaps will not attend to this matter {alt. tr.: will temporize} and not


‘break’ him. I can rely only on your excellency and your kindness for reprimanding him, and for dealing with {alt. tr.: to counsel him and investigate}


this discreetly, not overtly. However, if he deviates from the right path, there is no choice 


but to deal with it overtly. Please make an effort to act for your servant in this matter as is right. Furthermore, my lord,


I wrote to this young man three letters, each sent on another ship and each accompanied by another copy {lit., ‘by your letter’},


and instructed those carrying them to hand them over only to your excellency; and


I told him in his letter what you will read {alt. tr.: are reading}. Please, open every letter addressed to him


and read it and give it to him, without his knowing (that you read it). I wrote to him in his letter


that I sent to you currency. If he wants {lit., ‘needs’} from you about ten dinars


or ten mithqāls from my goods, you should give it to him, my lord, if he is proceeding to 


Aden without delay. However, if he deviates from the path, do not pay him anything, my lord.


Thus, please inquire {alt. tr.: do not pay him anything, my lord, after you, my lord, have inquired} into that matter; and if he, my lord, is proceeding to Aden and asks


for ten mithqāls and even more, pay them to him from my goods. My lord,


I sent him (Baghdādī) a large brazilwood box with sugar, on [(III,5v:1) {which is his name, through the agency of Sheikh}] 


Abū ʿAlī, mentioned above. [(III,5v:2) {If he is at your place, give him the letters and the brazilwood box}]


with sugar.

[continues from III,5] {what is not seen by


[(III,5:4) one who is absent. Send it to me on the first ship traveling to Aden. And you, my lord,}] are free of liability. And if [(III,5:5) {you, my lord, have an opportunity to come, bring it with you, God willing.}]


Furthermore, I sent a mazza, in which there are 14 ½ pounds of copper, [(III,5:6) {including a ewer}]


that is broken, a broken stool and other things. Please be kind enough to make for me from it


a basin and ewer, which should be small and simple, their weight being exactly six pounds


or five and a half, more or less, and a small stand for a small


candle; its weight should be exactly from two to two and a half pounds; it should be simple


and of good workmanship of the type you find attractive. The rest of the copper should be sold and added


to the account (in my favor). I sent to your illustrious excellency what has no importance and which is not


worth mentioning, namely a large brazilwood box containing white sugar, an Alexandrian maqṭaʿ, a half a pound


Iṣbahānī kohl, half a pound of ʿilk gum, four dasts of Egyptian paper of small


size. Please accept this in return for some of your services. The paper, the kohl, and the ʿilk are in


the mazza with the copper. The maqṭaʿ alone is in a piece of cloth. All this, together with the bag of silk and the bag


of arsenic, is sent in the ship of Fidyār with the above-mentioned Sheikh Abū ʿAlī b. Ṭayyib al-Miṣrī.


And, my lord, I would like you to help him (Abū ʿAlī) in all he buys


and sells, for he is a stranger, unfamiliar with that country. Whatever you do for him


will reach me. May I never miss your favors! By God, my lord, I attempted to get


some raisins to send to your excellency. However, none whatsoever


was to be had in Aden this year. Please forgive your servant for this. On the bag of arsenic there is written ‘Abraham Yijū,


sent by Joseph b. Abraham.’ It is wrapped in hides. You, my lord, mentioned that the young man Abu ʾl-Faraj b. Moses


al-Baghdādī was traveling to Ceylon. I received his letter, in which he complained that the nākhudā


Ibn Abu ʾl-Katāʾib demanded from him payment for the hire of a compartment, even though he did not carry {alt tr.: did not agree to carry} for him anything


in his ship. He also mentioned that he might travel to Ceylon or stay on.

my lord. Making a bold demand on [your kindness, I have sent you a package]


through the agency of Sheikh Abū ʿAli b. Ṭayyib [and… (?) the Egyp]tians. In it are


goods, namely six manns of good [...] silk in a waterproof satchel.


On top of the satchel is a canvas on which is written ‘Abraham Yijū, sent by Joseph b. Abraham.’


Moreover, I had here a bag of yellow arsenic. I heard that arsenic in your place


is in demand, and in particular the people of Ceylon search for it a great deal. I have sent [it], my lord,


to you, its weight exactly 160 pounds. And it is fine arsenic. Please make an effort, [continues with III,5]}
