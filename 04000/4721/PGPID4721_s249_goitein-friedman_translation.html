                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>this year in the ship of ⟦Nbrdwy {or read: Nbyrwy}⟧ Fidyār. I sent with him {alt. tr.: wrote and sent with him} a letter of proxy,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>{which I confirmed by witnesses; and the document} is (designated) “a letter of proxy against Abu ʾl-Faraj b. Mūsā</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Baghdādī.” I did so as a matter of precaution. Now, may I, your servant, ask you a favor—may God make permanent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your honored position! If this young man is (still) with you, or has come back from Ceylon and is going to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aden, let no one know that I sent a letter of proxy against him or against anyone else. Moreover, please tell Sheikh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ḍāfir that in this case he should not undertake anything in the matter despite my instructions to him. However, if</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>—God forbid—he has deviated from the right path and has declared bankruptcy or intends to travel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to a place other than Aden, please inform Sheikh Ḍāfir to produce the letter of proxy against him in order to demand from him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what he owes. Sheikh Ḍāfir is a very busy man and perhaps will not attend to this matter {alt. tr.: will temporize} and not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘break’ him. I can rely only on your excellency and your kindness for reprimanding him, and for dealing with {alt. tr.: to counsel him and investigate}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this discreetly, not overtly. However, if he deviates from the right path, there is no choice </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but to deal with it overtly. Please make an effort to act for your servant in this matter as is right. Furthermore, my lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote to this young man three letters, each sent on another ship and each accompanied by another copy {lit., ‘by your letter’},</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and instructed those carrying them to hand them over only to your excellency; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I told him in his letter what you will read {alt. tr.: are reading}. Please, open every letter addressed to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and read it and give it to him, without his knowing (that you read it). I wrote to him in his letter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that I sent to you currency. If he wants {lit., ‘needs’} from you about ten dinars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or ten mithqāls from my goods, you should give it to him, my lord, if he is proceeding to </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aden without delay. However, if he deviates from the path, do not pay him anything, my lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, please inquire {alt. tr.: do not pay him anything, my lord, after you, my lord, have inquired} into that matter; and if he, my lord, is proceeding to Aden and asks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for ten mithqāls and even more, pay them to him from my goods. My lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sent him (Baghdādī) a large brazilwood box with sugar, on [(III,5v:1) {which is his name, through the agency of Sheikh}] </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abū ʿAlī, mentioned above. [(III,5v:2) {If he is at your place, give him the letters and the brazilwood box}]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with sugar. </p>
</li>
</ol>

                        <h3>Verso</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>[continues from III,5] {what is not seen by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[(III,5:4) one who is absent. Send it to me on the first ship traveling to Aden. And you, my lord,}] are free of liability. And if [(III,5:5) {you, my lord, have an opportunity to come, bring it with you, God willing.}]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, I sent a mazza, in which there are 14 ½ pounds of copper, [(III,5:6) {including a ewer}]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that is broken, a broken stool and other things. Please be kind enough to make for me from it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a basin and ewer, which should be small and simple, their weight being exactly six pounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or five and a half, more or less, and a small stand for a small</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>candle; its weight should be exactly from two to two and a half pounds; it should be simple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and of good workmanship of the type you find attractive. The rest of the copper should be sold and added</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to the account (in my favor). I sent to your illustrious excellency what has no importance and which is not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>worth mentioning, namely a large brazilwood box containing white sugar, an Alexandrian maqṭaʿ, a half a pound</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iṣbahānī kohl, half a pound of ʿilk gum, four dasts of Egyptian paper of small</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>size. Please accept this in return for some of your services. The paper, the kohl, and the ʿilk are in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the mazza with the copper. The maqṭaʿ alone is in a piece of cloth. All this, together with the bag of silk and the bag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of arsenic, is sent in the ship of Fidyār with the above-mentioned Sheikh Abū ʿAlī b. Ṭayyib al-Miṣrī.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And, my lord, I would like you to help him (Abū ʿAlī) in all he buys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and sells, for he is a stranger, unfamiliar with that country. Whatever you do for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will reach me. May I never miss your favors! By God, my lord, I attempted to get</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some raisins to send to your excellency. However, none whatsoever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>was to be had in Aden this year. Please forgive your servant for this. On the bag of arsenic there is written ‘Abraham Yijū,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sent by Joseph b. Abraham.’ It is wrapped in hides. You, my lord, mentioned that the young man Abu ʾl-Faraj b. Moses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Baghdādī was traveling to Ceylon. I received his letter, in which he complained that the nākhudā</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ibn Abu ʾl-Katāʾib demanded from him payment for the hire of a compartment, even though he did not carry {alt tr.: did not agree to carry} for him anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in his ship. He also mentioned that he might travel to Ceylon or stay on.</p>

<li>
<p>{[...perhaps he intends to travel to] [(III,6) a place other than to Aden. My lord, when] [(III,5) I learned this]} news, that he was traveling to Ceylon, I became distressed. Afterwards I took courage and saw that Ḍafīr b. Farāj was traveling to your place {lit., ‘to you’} </p>

<p>through the agency of Sheikh Abū ʿAli b. Ṭayyib [and… (?) the Egyp]tians. In it are</p>

<p>goods, namely six manns of good [...] silk in a waterproof satchel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On top of the satchel is a canvas on which is written ‘Abraham Yijū, sent by Joseph b. Abraham.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, I had here a bag of yellow arsenic. I heard that arsenic in your place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is in demand, and in particular the people of Ceylon search for it a great deal. I have sent [it], my lord,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to you, its weight exactly 160 pounds. And it is fine arsenic. Please make an effort, [continues with III,5]}</p>
