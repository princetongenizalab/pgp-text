In your letters,
which arrived during the first ten days of Tammuz of the year (4)916, 
you mentioned that Moses had been captured. The moment we read 
the letter, we grieved and wept 
very much. Father and mother could not speak from 
sorrow about my brother Moses and about you {alt. tr.: because of what befell my brother Moses and your sorrow}. However, when we saw 
the letter of Moses, my brother and head, which contained biblical verses that indicated that 
he had been released, we became consoled. He did not explain how everything 
occurred, neither how he had been captured, nor how he had been released, nor did 
my brother Abu ’l-Surūr explain what 
he was doing and what caused him not to mention his cousin {lit., ‘the daughter of his paternal uncle’},
nor how much {lit., ‘how much merchandise’} had been lost. We had had no knowledge that 
my brother Moses had been captured. Only some people reported that 
Jews had been captured and that the pirates had taken the Jews 
and their light baggage, while the heavy cargo had remained in the ship.
When the ship arrived in Messina, part of the cargo {alt tr.: ‘the merchandise} was sequestered by the
commander Mubashshir. However, we had no details about Moses {alt. tr.: we were unable to verify Moses’ situation}, until
your letters arrived. This is what they said concerning the heavy items, 
that they had been sequestered. No one came and said: I was there or I saw. 
We sent a number of letters to Messina with the request that someone send us back
an answer, but no one replied. We sent you, in
the ship of Janūnayn, two letters and another letter to Tripoli
this year, for we had heard that forty galleys
of the adversary had arrived at Bijāya and some arrived
at other places, which might be dangerous {lit., ‘are to be feared’}. Please, brother,
neither of you should travel. The Lord will guard your (pl.) going and coming!
In Marḥeshwān 915, we received a slip
of paper //from Ḥajjāj—may he be remembered [[for his deeds]]—// saying “Your sons have sent you
something {alt. tr.: some merchandise} with me; as soon as I unpack {it}, I shall send it to you.” He sent one hundred rubā'īs
less eleven rubā'īs. We consumed them that year, for there was
great dearth {lit., ‘hunger’}, one mudd of wheat costing eight rubā'īs
and finally ten rubā'īs. When the year was over, there did not remain of that sum
even the smallest balance {lit., ‘there remained only the smallest thing’}. Wanting to secure our livelihood, we sent
him a number of letters. After we had appealed for assistance from {alt. tr.: humbly appealed to} Sheikh Abu
’l-Faraj, who did not disappoint us—please send him a letter
of thanks—he sent us another one hundred rubā'īs, less ten rubā'īs.
However, he did not forward to us letters,—although we had sent to him,
imploring him to do so—nor did he send us anything {alt. tr.: any merchandise}, so that we do not know
the quantity {add: of the merchandise} inform us how much you had sent
with Ḥajjāj and what was lost, how many bales {alt. tr.: items}, <<what sign was on them, how they looked, and whether your name was written on them>>.
Maybe, God willing, some of them will be salvaged.
