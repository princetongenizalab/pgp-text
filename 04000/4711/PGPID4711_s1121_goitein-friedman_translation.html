                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li>In your letters,</li>
<li>which arrived during the first ten days of Tammuz of the year (4)916, </li>
<li>you mentioned that Moses had been captured. The moment we read </li>
<li>the letter, we grieved and wept </li>
<li>very much. Father and mother could not speak from </li>
<li>sorrow about my brother Moses and about you {alt. tr.: because of what befell my brother Moses and your sorrow}. However, when we saw </li>
<li>the letter of Moses, my brother and head, which contained biblical verses that indicated that </li>
<li>he had been released, we became consoled. He did not explain how everything </li>
<li>occurred, neither how he had been captured, nor how he had been released, nor did </li>
<li>my brother Abu ’l-Surūr explain what </li>
<li>he was doing and what caused him not to mention his cousin {lit., ‘the daughter of his paternal uncle’},</li>
<li>nor how much {lit., ‘how much merchandise’} had been lost. We had had no knowledge that </li>
<li>my brother Moses had been captured. Only some people reported that </li>
<li>Jews had been captured and that the pirates had taken the Jews </li>
<li>and their light baggage, while the heavy cargo had remained in the ship.</li>
<li>When the ship arrived in Messina, part of the cargo {alt tr.: ‘the merchandise} was sequestered by the</li>
<li>commander Mubashshir. However, we had no details about Moses {alt. tr.: we were unable to verify Moses’ situation}, until</li>
<li>your letters arrived. This is what they said concerning the heavy items, </li>
<li>that they had been sequestered. No one came and said: I was there or I saw. </li>
<li>We sent a number of letters to Messina with the request that someone send us back</li>
<li>an answer, but no one replied. We sent you, in</li>
<li>the ship of Janūnayn, two letters and another letter to Tripoli</li>
<li>this year, for we had heard that forty galleys</li>
<li>of the adversary had arrived at Bijāya and some arrived</li>
<li>at other places, which might be dangerous {lit., ‘are to be feared’}. Please, brother,</li>
<li>neither of you should travel. The Lord will guard your (pl.) going and coming!</li>
<li>In Marḥeshwān 915, we received a slip</li>
<li>of paper //from Ḥajjāj—may he be remembered [[for his deeds]]—// saying “Your sons have sent you</li>
<li>something {alt. tr.: some merchandise} with me; as soon as I unpack {it}, I shall send it to you.” He sent one hundred rubā'īs</li>
<li>less eleven rubā'īs. We consumed them that year, for there was</li>
<li>great dearth {lit., ‘hunger’}, one mudd of wheat costing eight rubā'īs</li>
<li>and finally ten rubā'īs. When the year was over, there did not remain of that sum</li>
<li>even the smallest balance {lit., ‘there remained only the smallest thing’}. Wanting to secure our livelihood, we sent</li>
<li>him a number of letters. After we had appealed for assistance from {alt. tr.: humbly appealed to} Sheikh Abu</li>
<li>’l-Faraj, who did not disappoint us—please send him a letter</li>
<li>of thanks—he sent us another one hundred rubā'īs, less ten rubā'īs.</li>
<li>However, he did not forward to us letters,—although we had sent to him,</li>
<li>imploring him to do so—nor did he send us anything {alt. tr.: any merchandise}, so that we do not know</li>
<li>the quantity {add: of the merchandise} inform us how much you had sent</li>
<li>with Ḥajjāj and what was lost, how many bales {alt. tr.: items}, &lt;&lt;what sign was on them, how they looked, and whether your name was written on them&gt;&gt;.</li>
<li>Maybe, God willing, some of them will be salvaged.</li>
