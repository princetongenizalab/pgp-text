                        <ol><li>On Monday, the eighth of the month of Iyyar of the year</li><li>1410, according to the count to which we are accustomed, in Fusṭāṭ Egypt, </li><li>[situated] on [the Nile] River, M(r.) Yaḥyā ha-Levi </li><li>b. … came to the seat of the court [and su]ed M(r.) Japheth, Glory of the Congregation, b. Abraham, (who) r(ests in) E(den)</li><li>for six[ty]-f[o]ur [dinars], saying that he had a pledge …</li><li>and they were a thick (piece) of ambergris (weighing … hundred) and twenty-eight “spools” of gold </li><li>and a “myrobalan” and thirty-three “apples” of ambergris, and a “myrobalan”</li><li>of ambergris, and a pair of bracelets, and a black iron chain </li><li>being worth in total thirty-two dinars, and a silver pail</li><li>and a silver basket weighing one hundred and fifty dirhams</li><li>and we asked—we, </li><li>the court …………. He claims this 65</li><li>din(ars), and what were (the details of) his joint enterprise (mu‘āmala) with this M(r.) Japheth,</li><li>for already ….. there we[re] 300 dinars in [it]</li><li>…[.]….. therein …. for the mint</li><li>in order that //he// will make use of its total amou[nt] and I will make use of profit</li><li>….. therein for me, and I have placed the gold which he bought</li><li>for me … he has for me, to the mint, and he took its tax</li><li>and a profit of 4 dinars came to me therein. I took it</li><li>from him, from the total of 300 din(ars), I took a little bit more than 200 din(ars), and </li><li>and he handed over pledges for the remainder due me</li><li>and [.]….. for him, and we asked this Japheth</li><li>concerning that, and he said, “I already [t]ook from him 300 din(ars) on the condition that</li><li>I will buy […..]... in … the mint</li></ol>

                        <ol><li>that which God will see fit therein (to provide) in terms of pro[fi]t will be (split) between us.</li><li>I bought the gold .. all that […] in [….]</li><li>I assessed the profit for him therein and paid …[.] … […]</li><li>whi[ch] was its quantity, and when […]</li><li>for us therein //reasons// and obstacles which happened in [….may the strength]</li><li>of God bring him success, bringing about [profit and no]t a</li><li>great lo[ss] from that [to which] I am now entitled. He came to me, and I was deeply distressed,</li><li>and he compelled me to write this document for him, and I paid him</li><li>these pledges which he mentioned. I decided that I would perform a</li><li>reckoning, and I would deliver to him that which he claims, and I had ten</li><li>dinars with him […] in the reckoning, but [h]e did not claim it</li><li>from me and […] dinars</li><li>[local] coinage […] … and this M(r.) Yaḥyā demonstrated</li><li>that the 10 din[ars ...this] M(r.) Japheth, and he said, “You only</li><li>accounted for  the …[…] and that of which you </li><li>chose to take […] </li><li>the Almoravid dinars …. at the time [I] paid the 300 dinars,</li><li>I gave them to him, and they were new […]</li><li>[exchan]ge rate for a third (of an Almoravid dinar) quarters [.] I said to him …</li><li>10 in its exchange rate.

                        <ol><li>On the very same day, M(r.) Amram b. Ezra</li><li>Head of the Congregation, came and sued the aforementioned M(r.) Japheth for ten</li><li>dinars, saying that he borrowed it […]</li><li>in that the head of the mint would credit him</li><li>with [….] . of tax of … his to the house (that is, to the mint) and that his hand</li><li>departed (that is, he left) the mint before he received the gold, and </li><li>the 10 dinars remained for him credited to this M(r.) Japheth, and M(r.) Japheth asked</li><li>concerning that, and he said, “I will claim it from tax</li><li>… and in //and in silver.// I bought it and .. the head of the mint, </li><li>and he sold it and …. (he brought) to the mint</li><li>its taxes, roughly fifty dinars, from which I took from him</li><li>five and a half dinars //there was another disparity// which remained </li><li>for me //and deposited// upon it […] and (what) we heard from them, we wrote</li><li>and signed in order that it would be a title of right and proof</li><li>In a different (court) session, the aforementioned Elder Abū ‘Alī M(r.) Japheth claimed from</li><li>this M(r.) Amram that he owed him</li><li>a disparity of one thousand and 500 din(ars), which was returned to him, and the amount</li><li>by which did not agree with the statement M(r.) //Amram// declared (was a) qīrāṭ </li><li>//and he said,// “This already happened (that is, was dealt with) between us—this and other (matters) in the financial transactions (mu‘āmalāt);</li><li>and no claim remains for him with me.” That which happened before us</li><li>we wrote and signed in order that there would be a title of right and proof. Hanging between</li><li>the lines: “Amram” “And he said” Confirmed, and this is its confirmation.</li></ol>
