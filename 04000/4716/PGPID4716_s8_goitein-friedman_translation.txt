I am sending you these few lines in well-being and health. [We arrived] on Sunday night 
of the week Wayiqqaḥ Qōraḥ and stayed overnight on board. On Monday [. . .], I disembarked [to take care of] sundry business and was met
by a man from Egypt, called Ibn Jāfī, who gave me a letter from Sheikh Abu ʾl-Fakhr
Ibn al-Amshāṭī, addressed to you, in which he expresses doubt about going there {alt. tr.: reservations about the trip}. My brother Moses had traveled to Palermo
heading for your place, so that you can write him the power of attorney. Please take the matter, namely the legal confirmation of that power of attorney, firmly in hand, with utmost
resolution, and send it as quickly as possible. I tried to get a loan from Sheikh
Abu ʾl-Rabīʿ of twenty rubāʿīs, in order to send them to you (pl). However, I did not find him to have gold, as he had invested it in business.
Again {lit., ‘Take notice’}, if the power of attorney is not legally confirmed, you will get nothing, unless you come in person. For, he says expressly in [his letter (?)] 
“...and send a document, in which your sister approves of the matter.” {Add: I have conveyed this information to you.} Do not be remiss in praying for me. Best
greetings to you, to my m[other], and to my brothers Moses and Samuel. Please greet 
my lord, the master and Mr. Jacob, his brother, and to Rabbi Zechariah, the best greetings, and to Mr. Solomon, greetings;
and to everybody who asks about me, and to my master, R. Ḥayyīm, the father of the rabbi, the best regards. Perhaps {alt. tr.: I hope that} he will not forget me
in his prayers. May your well-being increase more and more, Amen Selah! And Peace. Take w[hat] I [for]warded,
namely the letter sent by Sheikh Abu ʾl-Fakhr, together with this letter. And Peace.
