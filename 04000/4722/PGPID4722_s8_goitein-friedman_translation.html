<li>I, your eminent excellency’s servant, learned of the death</li>
<li>of the late master and lord Maḍmūn, the Mordecai of our time,</li>
<li>the eminent pillar, the Nagid (Prince) of the land of Yemen, the leader </li>
<li>of the congregations, the pride of the communities—may his soul be bound up in the bundle of life together with the righteous and pious!— </li>
<li>son of his honor, great and holy master and lord Japheth—may he rest in Eden! I, the servant of</li>
<li>your excellency, was informed of this by other people, not from a letter that reached me, the servant of</li>
<li>your excellency, either from his excellency, my master, or one from their excellencies, </li>
<li>my lords and masters, our master and lord Ḥalfon—may his Rock preserve him!—and our master</li>
<li>and lord Bundār—may the Merciful keep him!—the sons of our master Maḍmūn—may he rest in Eden!</li>
<li>But there arrived a letter from the two brothers {lit., ‘from their two excellencies’} to friends of mine {alt. tr.: our coreligionists},</li>
<li>which, however, I, the servant of your excellency, have not read. For you—may</li>
<li>God make your honored position permanent!—know that their correspondence with the lamented—may God</li>
<li>favor him with His preference {read: sanctify his soul}!—was separate from mine {alt. tr.: their correspondence concerning he who may God sanctify his soul was kept separate from me}, your excellency’s servant. However,</li>
<li>I wrote to his two sons {lit., ‘the two eminent excellencies’} that their noble letters</li>
<li>should reach the most beloved {alt. tr.: devoted} servant of their father {lit., ‘his excel- lency’},</li>
<li>to inform you of this, for you are one of the most beloved {alt. tr.: devoted}</li>
<li>servants of his excellency. To your excellency and to all those embraced</li>
<li>by your care, the best greetings. Kindly send me—may God make permanent </li>
