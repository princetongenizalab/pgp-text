I, your eminent excellency’s servant, learned of the death
of the late master and lord Maḍmūn, the Mordecai of our time,
the eminent pillar, the Nagid (Prince) of the land of Yemen, the leader 
of the congregations, the pride of the communities—may his soul be bound up in the bundle of life together with the righteous and pious!— 
son of his honor, great and holy master and lord Japheth—may he rest in Eden! I, the servant of
your excellency, was informed of this by other people, not from a letter that reached me, the servant of
your excellency, either from his excellency, my master, or one from their excellencies, 
my lords and masters, our master and lord Ḥalfon—may his Rock preserve him!—and our master
and lord Bundār—may the Merciful keep him!—the sons of our master Maḍmūn—may he rest in Eden!
But there arrived a letter from the two brothers {lit., ‘from their two excellencies’} to friends of mine {alt. tr.: our coreligionists},
which, however, I, the servant of your excellency, have not read. For you—may
God make your honored position permanent!—know that their correspondence with the lamented—may God
favor him with His preference {read: sanctify his soul}!—was separate from mine {alt. tr.: their correspondence concerning he who may God sanctify his soul was kept separate from me}, your excellency’s servant. However,
I wrote to his two sons {lit., ‘the two eminent excellencies’} that their noble letters
should reach the most beloved {alt. tr.: devoted} servant of their father {lit., ‘his excel- lency’},
to inform you of this, for you are one of the most beloved {alt. tr.: devoted}
servants of his excellency. To your excellency and to all those embraced
by your care, the best greetings. Kindly send me—may God make permanent

your honored position!—your esteemed letter notifying me whether you will come to Dhū Jibla or travel on the sea…
