In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. 


The slave ʿUmar ibn Masʿūd, the leader of the archers 


in the frontier city of Alexandria, the guarded,


kisses the ground and reports that he has been the leader of a unit of archers continuously since the days


of al-Kāmil until the present. The slave has trained two boys to be archers. They are unemployed,


without any income. The petition of the slave from the charities of our master, may God strengthen his victory,


is to employ them in the unit of the slave and to appoint him ... [ ]


as a kindness to the slave and a benefaction to him. The resolution (of the master) is most exalted.


If God wills, the exalted.
