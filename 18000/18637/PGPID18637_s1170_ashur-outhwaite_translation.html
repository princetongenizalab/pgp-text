                        <p>1          For a good sign, and success, and wealth</p>
<p>2          and honour and comfort</p>
<p>3          On the fourth day of the week, which is the sixth day of the month of Tammuz, in the year two thousand two hundred and ten</p>
<p>4          of the Era of Documents, in the town of Qā<sup>ʿ</sup> Bīr al-<sup>ʿ</sup>Azab, which is located on her wellsprings, at this day</p>
<p>5         there came before us—we, the undersigned witnesses—Sālim ibn Hārūn al-<sup>ʿ</sup>Uzayrī known as Zihreh and</p>
<p>6          told us: “You know, O masters, that I married this Ġinā bint Sālim ibn Šakir al-Tām, the virgin</p>

<p>11        to Ġinā bint Sālim ibn Šakir al-Tām, the virgin bride, “Be my wife, according to the law of Moses and Israel.</p>
<p>12        And I by the command of Heaven will serve, honour, support, nourish, provide and clothe you, in the manner of Jewish men</p>
<p>13        who serve, honour, support, nourish, provide and clothe their wives faithfully. And I am giving you</p>
<p>14        the mohar of your virginity, two hundred silver zuz, which are equivalent to twenty-five pure silver zuz,</p>
<p>15        which are due for you, and your sustenance, your clothing and your needs and to come to you as is the custom of the entire world.” And this bride consented and became</p>
