In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. Praise be to God, the praise of the thankful.


The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings and peace 


be upon our master and lord, the 'imiim al-'Amir bi-'A\lkam Allah, commander of the faithful, and upon his pure ancestors


and most noble sons. The servant and slave


kisses the ground in the noble presence, may God double its light, raise aloft


its beacon and make his helpers numerous, and reports to the lofty and glorious presence


of al-'MQal, commander of the armies, may God extend his power and exalt his word. The information that I have for the attention of the prospering 'amir,


l;Iusam al-Dawla, may god establish his felicity, is


that the auspicious and blessed produce has been left without a watchman,


so go out today and seek out people to substitute for the watchmen. Oh my lord, the 'amir,


may God prolong his life, and cause to endure his support, his happiness, his good health and his good fortune. May he (i.e. God) crush in humiliation


and contempt those who envy him and his enemies, if God, the exalted, wills, with peace and God's blessings. God is my sufficiency. What an excellent keeper is he!


Peace.
