<li>
<p>In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate. Praise be to God, the praise of the thankful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings and peace&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be upon our master and lord, the 'imiim al-'Amir bi-'A\lkam Allah, commander of the faithful, and upon his pure ancestors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and most noble sons. The servant and slave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kisses the ground in the noble presence, may God double its light, raise aloft</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its beacon and make his helpers numerous, and reports to the lofty and glorious presence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of al-'MQal, commander of the armies, may God extend his power and exalt his word. The information that I have for the attention of the prospering 'amir,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>l;Iusam al-Dawla, may god establish his felicity, is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the auspicious and blessed produce has been left without a watchman,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so go out today and seek out people to substitute for the watchmen. Oh my lord, the 'amir,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>may God prolong his life, and cause to endure his support, his happiness, his good health and his good fortune. May he (i.e. God) crush in humiliation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and contempt those who envy him and his enemies, if God, the exalted, wills, with peace and God's blessings. God is my sufficiency. What an excellent keeper is he!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace.</p>
</li>
