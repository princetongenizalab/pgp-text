Khuyalāʾ ibn Ḥasan and Abū al-Jaysh


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


The slave kisses the ground before the master, the mighty lord, al-Malik


[aI-ʿĀdil], the victorious, the heroic, the helper of Islam, the succour of mankind,


sultan of the armies of the Muslims, may God perpetuate his dominion, and reports that


the district known as Minyat KhaIaf was in the name of the amīr [[Muʾnis]] ʿAlī ibn Jawl


..


al-Mihrānī, but he decamped, that which was in his name being left vacant, and went to


the master Sayf al-Islām. He asks for the kindness of allowing them to enter


upon his iqṭāʿ there, so that they may find means to serve


the master, as a kindness and benefaction to them. To the exalted resolutions 


belong their eminence, if God, the exalted, wills.


[Praise be to God] alone and his blessings be upon [our lord Muḥammad, his prophet, and save him.]
