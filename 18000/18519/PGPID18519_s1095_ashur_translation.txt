One ounce of sticky sugar melted in hot water.
He should squeeze juice from two lemons onto it and drink
it lukewarm in order to vomit. One hour after vomiting,
he should sip two ounces of a lemon and squill-like oxymel drink,
heated to lukewarm on a low flame, mixed
with melissa-type and green mint leaves.   
And he should be careful not to eat unripe dates,
Christ's Thorn jujube, green almonds, carob, green broad beans,
carrots and any food that contains vinegar
or taro. And for dessert he should eat only raisins,
pistachios, figs and nuts.
The Lord will ward off from you all sickness. May the wellbeing of his Excellency increase forever!
Neṣaḥ. Sela.
