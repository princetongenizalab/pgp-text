Recto 


al-’Afḍal, sword of Islam, the defender, the protector of the judges of the Muslims [and the guide]


of the dā‘īs of the believers, may God fortify the religion through him, give joy to the [commander of the faithful] by his longevity,


cause his power to endure and exalt his word. The slave kisses the ground and requests


his indulgence to institute for him a corn allowance that is paid to him every year, as a kindness and


benefaction to him.


To the exalted seat belongs the lofty distinction and the power regarding that.


Our sufficiency is God. What an excellent keeper is he! Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and save him.
