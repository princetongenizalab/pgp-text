<p>al-Afḍal, sword of Islam, the defender, the protector of the judges of the Muslims [and the guide]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the &nbsp;dāʿīs of the believers, may God fortify the religion through him, give joy to the [commander of the faithful] by his longevity,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cause his power to endure and exalt his word. The slave kisses the ground and requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his indulgence to institute for him a corn allowance that is paid to him every year, as a kindness and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>benefaction to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the exalted seat belongs the lofty distinction and the power regarding that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our sufficiency is God. What an excellent keeper is he! Praise be to God alone&nbsp;and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and save him.</p>
