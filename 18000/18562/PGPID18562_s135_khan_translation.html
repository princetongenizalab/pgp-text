<li>
<p>He pays the poll tax that he is liable for, the annual amount of which is one dīnār, a third and a quarter, and one dirham.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At most times it is difficult for him to pay the full amount until Jews of his sect charitably</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>help him to do so. Recently the slave was afflicted with a disease in his eyes and he lost his sight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has no longer been able to look after his wordly affairs nor conduct his profession. He and his family are dying of hunger,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but the collectors of the poll tax in Fusṭāṭ are pressing him for payment. This has caused suffering to the slave and led to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his imprisonment and the wasting away of himself and of his family through hunger and isolation, through fear of being demanded to pay what he cannot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>afford. Far be it from these glorious days that an impecunious, blind man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>should be required to pay the poll tax and be treated with contempt by the tax-collectors. The slave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kisses the ground again and, humbly asks for the issuing of an exalted rescript,&nbsp;may God increase its efficacy, ...</p>
</li>
