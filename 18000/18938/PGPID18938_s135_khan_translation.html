<li>... known as 'Abū al-'A'sār, the head of the arsenal and [ there have been no] dealings</li>
<li>between him and the slave, he is not in debt, nor does he owe a deposit or a surety,</li>
<li>but the aforementioned head oppressed the slave and demanded from him something that was owed by his brother but that he himself had no obligation to pay.</li>
<li>He threatened him with a penalty and issued a tarsīm against the slave on his behalf and intimidated (him) with his strength and high office.</li>
<li>Justice should prevent his unlawful action and his taking from other people what they have no [obligation to pay. The slave requests]</li>
<li>a kindness to be done to him by the issuing of an exalted rescript [ to remove]</li>
<li>the oppressive treatment from the slave in order that [ ] is not taken from [him,]</li>
<li>to treat his case with justice and to deposit the rescript in his hand [ ]</li>
<li>To the seat belongs the exalted resolution regarding that, if God, the exalted, wills.</li>
<li>Praise be to God alone, his benedictions be upon Mupammad and save him.</li>
