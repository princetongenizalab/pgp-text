Verso

... known as 'Abū al-'A'sār, the head of the arsenal and [ there have been no] dealings
between him and the slave, he is not in debt, nor does he owe a deposit or a surety,
but the aforementioned head oppressed the slave and demanded from him something that was owed by his brother but that he himself had no obligation to pay.
He threatened him with a penalty and issued a tarsīm against the slave on his behalf and intimidated (him) with his strength and high office.
Justice should prevent his unlawful action and his taking from other people what they have no [obligation to pay. The slave requests]
a kindness to be done to him by the issuing of an exalted rescript [ to remove]
the oppressive treatment from the slave in order that [ ] is not taken from [him,]
to treat his case with justice and to deposit the rescript in his hand [ ]
To the seat belongs the exalted resolution regarding that, if God, the exalted, wills.
Praise be to God alone, his benedictions be upon Mupammad and save him.
