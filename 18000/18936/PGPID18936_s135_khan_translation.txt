In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.  
What does our lord the elder, the jurisconsult, the master, the ascetic, the pious 
Shihāb al-Dīn, may God grant him success for his obedience, say concerning the  following: a Jewish man  
has a low house, next to which is a high house 
belonging to a Muslim. The house of the Muslim has fallen on the house 
of the Jew and destroyed walls and broken ceilings,  
timber, [          ], marble, columns and such household vessels  
as earthenware pots etc. Is the Muslim liable to the  
Jew for these walls and is he liable for the breakage  
of the timber, marble, columns, pots and other  
utensils in kind or should he give him (what corresponds to) their value? 
Grant us your opinion, may God have mercy upon you.

If he gave warning of something that has fallen  
[                                  But if]  
he has not given warning and it falls [              ]  
liability. God knows best.
