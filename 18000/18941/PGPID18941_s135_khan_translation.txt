Recto

.In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.
The slave of my master the amīr Tāj al-Dawla, may God prolong his life and cause to endure his support and exaltation and crush those who envy him and his enemies,
is a Khaybarī Jew from the community of Baghdad, from among those upon whom God had bestowed his bounties. Recently he has been brought low by misfortune
on account of a pledge that his slave made in the office of the elder Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. Ḥasan,
may God cause his support to endure. He went broke while still owing three hundred dinārs. The slave was imprisoned for nine months
with a fee of one dīnār until his slave became impoverished and suffered affliction. He was released after great hardship.
His slave is obliged to make a tunic, which is preventing him from returning to his hometown. He has undertaken some of the work
by himself, but has not completed his task due to the necessity of making it out
of two pieces of Persian material (coloured) with a combination of white and yellow.
The heart of his slave is confident in the comforts of his sound opinion ........ ,
If he, may God make his power endure and cause him to attain his goal, should resolve to help his slave in [ ]
.. his work, let him kindly do so and be rewarded. His task is made short and approaching its end
through his kindness and generosity, forever, if God wills.
My sufficiency is God; [what an excellent keeper is He.]
