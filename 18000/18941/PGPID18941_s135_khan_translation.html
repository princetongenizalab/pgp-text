<li>.In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.</li>
<li>The slave of my master the amīr Tāj al-Dawla, may God prolong his life and cause to endure his support and exaltation and crush those who envy him and his enemies,</li>
<li>is a Khaybarī Jew from the community of Baghdad, from among those upon whom God had bestowed his bounties. Recently he has been brought low by misfortune</li>
<li>on account of a pledge that his slave made in the office of the elder Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn b. Ḥasan,</li>
<li>may God cause his support to endure. He went broke while still owing three&nbsp;hundred dinārs. The slave was imprisoned for nine months</li>
<li>with a fee of one dīnār until his slave became impoverished and suffered affliction. He was released after great hardship.</li>
<li>His slave is obliged to make a tunic, which is preventing him from returning to his hometown. He has undertaken some of the work</li>
<li>by himself, but has not completed his task due to the necessity of making it out</li>
<li>of two pieces of Persian material (coloured) with a combination of white and&nbsp;yellow.</li>
<li>The heart of his slave is confident in the comforts of his sound opinion ........ ,</li>
<li>If he, may God make his power endure and cause him to attain his goal, should&nbsp;resolve to help his slave in [ ]</li>
<li>.. his work, let him kindly do so and be rewarded. His task is made short and approaching its end</li>
<li>through his kindness and generosity, forever, if God wills.</li>
<li>My sufficiency is God; [what an excellent keeper is He.]</li>
