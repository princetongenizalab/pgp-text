Recto

... harm and wrong done to him and to them. The justice of the prophetic dynasty, may God make its reign eternal and protect its strength,
and of my great master ʿAmīd al-Dawla, may God cause his happiness to endure and crush those who envy him and his enemies, will prevent that and punish those
who perpetrate it. His slave again requests his noble presence, may God guard him, to give instructions
for the repossession of these properties from his slave and remitting from him whatever arrears, claim or damage maybe associated with them in the office of the military district of Palestine
and the putting a stop to the suspicion against him and the oppression, so that the injustice that has beset him may thereby be discontinued,
as a kind act and a benefaction for him. His slave has written a third petition to the lofty presence,
which he has enclosed within this missive. Would his great lord ʿAmīd al-Dawla, may God cause his bounty to endure and crush those who envy him,
kindly take cognizance of them and munificently issue a rescript commanding that possession be taken of them and that the (necessary) repairs on them be undertaken.
This would constitute a favour for the mighty fiscus and kind consideration for his slave, since at the moment they are administered neither by his slave
nor by the fiscus. They are being plundered and do not yield any income by any means.
If my great lord ʿAmid al-Dawla—may God prolong his life, cause to endure his loftiness, eminence, support,
sublimity, power and happiness and crush with humility and contempt those who envy him and his foes—should resolve to do his slave the kindness
of considering his missive carefully, responding to his request and realizing his expectations and hopes,
as a benefaction to him and as an act of charity, and honour him with his lofty commands and his exalted prohibitions or [ ]
service for him and communicate his orders to him - let him kindly do so, by the will of God, he is great and mighty, him we trust and ask for succour.
[Praise] be to God, the lord of the Universe, and his blessings, praise him, [ ] his prophet [ ]
