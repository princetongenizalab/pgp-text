The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings [and peace]


 ... what was assigned to them as the land of their fief, to wit one hundred faddāns, which the local judge took possession of.


The exalted orders were issued for the restoration of a market to their fief in place of their (present) market,


but the local judge in Minyat Ġamr did not allow them this and he did not return the land to them. The assessment of the wealth


of their fief is five-thousand, five-hundred dinars and the assessment of the land of the village is one thousand faddāns.


They request the issuing of an exalted ordinance, may God increase its efficacy, to establish a market for their fief


one day a week in place of their (present) market and the return of the aforementioned land to them,


or their compensation with another fief that is registered in the auspicious office of al-'Adil,


on the grounds that these two villages are suitable to be annexed to the district of Minyat Ġamr, on account of the cultivation of sugar cane


and the tilling of (the land) that is the subject of this petition,


as a kindness and benefaction to them.


To the exalted resolutions belongs eminence, sublimity and power, if God wills.


Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and save him.
