<p>The benedictions of God and his blessings, his increasing benefactions and most excellent greetings [and peace]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;... what was assigned to them as the land of their fief, to wit one hundred faddāns, which the local judge took possession of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exalted orders were issued for the restoration of a market to their fief in place of their (present) market,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but the local judge in Minyat Ġamr did not allow them this and he did not return the land to them. The assessment of the wealth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of their fief is five-thousand, five-hundred dinars and the assessment of the land of the village is one thousand faddāns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They request the issuing of an exalted ordinance, may God increase its efficacy, to establish a market for their fief</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one day a week in place of their (present) market and the return of the aforementioned land to them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or their compensation with another fief that is registered in the auspicious office of al-'Adil,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on the grounds that these two villages are suitable to be annexed to the district of Minyat Ġamr, on account of the cultivation of sugar cane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the tilling of (the land) that is the subject of this petition,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as a kindness and benefaction to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the exalted resolutions belongs eminence, sublimity and power, if God wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad and save him.</p>
