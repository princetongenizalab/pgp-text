<li>
<p>All the silver, copper, wooden vessels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and marble that are in it. All of this amounts to a large quantity. He broke themdown</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and with their proceeds built an enclosure designed to contain a press and shops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is enjoying income from them and in addition to all this he is receiving large sums from their rent.</p>
</li>

<p>When the exalted command and mighty documents were issued (enjoining)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the return of the remaining churches to their owners, constraining them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by law and disallowing them (to have any claims on) them by the hand ofauthority, (he did not heed the decree) and. it has remained in his possession</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>until now, as the slave has explained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slave of our master, the benedictions of God be upon him, would like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an exalted rescript to be issued to the office of the reclaimed fiefs,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(instructing) the aforementioned sum to be paid to the slave within four years,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the first (instalment) being (paid in) the kharājī year four-hundred and twenty-one,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>amounting to twenty-four dinārs, at a rate of six dinārs in every [year]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or its return to the Christians of the district. To our master,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the benedictions of God be upon him, belongs the exalted resolution regardingwhat the slave has requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May God fulfil his promise for our master, may he cause his reign to be eternaland his army to be victorious. May he praise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muḥammad the prophet, his&nbsp; ancestor, and save him.</p>
