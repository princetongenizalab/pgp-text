Recto 


All the silver, copper, wooden vessels


and marble that are in it. All of this amounts to a large quantity. He broke them down


and with their proceeds built an enclosure designed to contain a press and shops.


He is enjoying income from them and in addition to all this he is receiving large sums from their rent.


When the exalted command and mighty documents were issued (enjoining)


the return of the remaining churches to their owners, constraining them


by law and disallowing them (to have any claims on) them by the hand of authority, (he did not heed the decree) and it has remained in his possession


until now, as the slave has explained.


The slave of our master, the benedictions of God be upon him, would like


an exalted rescript to be issued to the office of the reclaimed fiefs,


(instructing) the aforementioned sum to be paid to the slave within four years,


the first (instalment) being (paid in) the kharājī year four-hundred and twenty-one,


amounting to twenty-four dinārs, at a rate of six dinārs in every [year]


or its return to the Christians of the district. To our master,


the benedictions of God be upon him, belongs the exalted resolution regarding what the slave has requested.


May God fulfil his promise for our master, may he cause his reign to be eternaland his army to be victorious. May he praise


Muḥammad the prophet, his  ancestor, and save him.
