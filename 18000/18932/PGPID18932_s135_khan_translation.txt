Recto 


All the silver, copper, wooden vessels


and marble that are in it. All of this amounts to a large quantity. He broke them down


and with their proceeds built an enclosure designed to contain a press and shops.


He is enjoying income from them and in addition to all this he is receiving large sums from their rent.


When the exalted command and mighty documents were issued (enjoining)


the return of the remaining churches to their owners, constraining them!


by law and disallowing them (to have any claims on) them' by the hand of authority, (he did not heed the decree) and it has remained in his possession


until now, as the slave has explained.


The slave of our master, the benedictions of God be upon him, would like


an exalted rescript to be issued to the office of the reclaimed fiefs,


(instructing) the aforementioned sum to be paid to the slave within four years,


the first (instalment) being (paid in) the karājī year four-hundred and twenty-one,


amounting to twenty-four dinārs, at a rate of six dinars in every [year]


or its return to the Christians of the district. To our master,


the benedictions of God be upon him, belongs the exalted resolution regarding what the slave has requested.


May God fulfil his promise for our master, may he cause his reign to be eternal and his army to be victorious. May he praise


MujIammad the prophet, his ancestor, and save him.
