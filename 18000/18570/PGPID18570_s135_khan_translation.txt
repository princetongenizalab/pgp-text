The slave


Tāhir ibn 'Isḥāq


In the name of God, the merciful and compassionate.


The slave of the lofty, mighty and sublime presence, the most gracious, the most noble isfahsalār,


the honourable leader, the ’amīr Bahā’ aI-Dīn, treasure of the sultans, chosen one of the dynasty


and its champion, the intimate friend of the commander of the faithful, may God cause to endure the comfort (afforded) by his life, establish a strong


defence of his soul, increase the protection of his glory and sublimity and give comfort


to the commander of the faithful by the lasting of his power and the prolongation of his life, reports that he is a poor man


from the community of Alexandria, may God, the exalted, protect it, who is away from home.


He rented a shop there in an enclosure belonging to a Christian and paid his rent in full


until the end of the term of the lease. He paid in full all the rent that he owed


and no longer owes anything. The slave has sought the grace of God, praise be to him, and asks


the master to treat him according to the requirements of the holy law, of justice and of impartiality and to


release the slave, so that he may be able attend to his family and his children and be united


with them, as a kindness and benefaction to him. [ ] if God, the exalted, wills.


Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon our lord Muḥammad, his prophet, and save him.
