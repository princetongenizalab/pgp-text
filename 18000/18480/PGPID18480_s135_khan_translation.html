<li>
<p>... al-&lsquo;Ä€dil, the victorious [ sultan]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the armies of the Muslims, (may God) cause his power to endure and exalt his&nbsp;word for ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slave kisses the ground before him and reports to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his compassion and benevolence that he is a poor, destitute and lowly man [he can only]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>live with great difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The livelihood of the slave among the Muslims has disappeared in the vicissitudes of the times [ he is obliged to pay]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in poll tax annually two dinars. He is unable [to pay this]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on account of his poverty and destitution. He has Muslim notables [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who can testify to the poverty and destitution of the slave. He requests[benevolence]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and kindness to him by looking into his case [and transferring him from]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the middle rate of poll tax to the low rate [ ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... according to his condition, so that he may be able to pay [the tax ]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>... his family and children and pay his rent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the exalted seat belongs the lofty and excellent opinion, if God wills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon the prophet and save him.</p>
