... al-‘Ādil, the victorious [ sultan]


of the armies of the Muslims, (may God) cause his power to endure and exalt his word for ever.


The slave kisses the ground before him and reports to


his compassion and benevolence that he is a poor, destitute and lowly man [he can only]


live with great difficulty.


The livelihood of the slave among the Muslims has disappeared in the vicissitudes of the times [ he is obliged to pay]


in poll tax annually two dinars. He is unable [to pay this]


on account of his poverty and destitution. He has Muslim notables [ ]


who can testify to the poverty and destitution of the slave. He requests[benevolence]


and kindness to him by looking into his case [and transferring him from]


the middle rate of poll tax to the low rate [ ]


... according to his condition, so that he may be able to pay [the tax ]


... his family and children and pay his rent.


To the exalted seat belongs the lofty and excellent opinion, if God wills.


Praise be to God alone and his blessings be upon the prophet and save him.
