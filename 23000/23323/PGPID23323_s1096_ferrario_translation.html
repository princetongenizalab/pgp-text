<p>to pay the price of the two cows, 120 lire-sterling, since they have caused their awful condition</p>
<p>to refund all the losses that the undersigned suffered since the planting of his lands, in particular the cotton fields, was damaged, because they caused there to be a shortage of water</p>
<p>to give satisfaction to the undersigned for all misdeeds committed against him and to pay all the expenses...</p>
