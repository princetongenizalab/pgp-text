                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>To the honourable, my lord and my master, my father-in-law, Mar Joseph the Baghdadi, from me, your son-in-law Abū ‘Alī.</li>
<li>
<p>Know, my lord, that when He who makes decrees decreed that we  should experience many trials, He gave us into the hand of our captors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who brought us with a number of men and women, and sold us here in  Constantinople. But we were ransomed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the Creator’s help, and the abundance of his kindness was upon us, and we didn’t meet our end, because there is no end to His mercy. And also,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>afterwards, a few days later, we became acquainted, I to your daughter and she to me, and we shed many tears together because  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we had been exiled from our land and separated from you all. And some of the people of [ ]ia made great efforts, and, in accordance with the decree</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of He who proclaims, we were joined together. And God showed us compassion and mercy, by providing us with sons and a daughter. The sons departed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for the House of Meeting, but we were left with the daughter, and she is betrothed to a young man, a Kohen, fair in all respects. And</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we still entertain the hope that perhaps we shall succeed in presenting  ourselves to bow down before you. And now, we had it in mind to come, with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God’s help, but because of various sicknesses which found us and be cause the last penny disappeared from our hands without our finding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even enough for ease, we gave up. And, O heavens, since then and up  to now we’ve kept you informed through many letters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but we haven’t received from you even a word of greeting in response.  Can such a thing be possible with you? Or is it fitting [for you?]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But on the contrary you have embittered me with the divorce deed  which you wrote. Instead of good, evil. And the [ ] will go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and cause it to pass. And now let us consider and attend only this once  to this Samuel. If you have compassion and mercy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>upon us, then let him consider what you should do for us, because of  our marriage deed you should show me compassion, and you should even speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with all your wisdom to meet this Samuel, a representative I appointed  to collect from my forefathers’ inheritance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about 10 dinars ‘of the place’, that perhaps he might bring them to us  to cover the cost of our coming to you. And now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[I am] writing to you: know and understand from your servant and your  son-in-law that since I wrote to you last year that you should prepare for  me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the marriage deed of my wife, your daughter, ‘Ashira, my only one,  therefore it must have been a difficult thing for you to do,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[for] you wrote to R. Elijah that I should divorce her with a divorce  deed when she was with a daughter and a son and a son-in-law! If you desire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this, my lord, then how much more do I wish that I could have divorced her right at the beginning. After our God blessed us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with offspring, how could you not show compassion for your own flesh and not fear the one whose very garment is the breath of your life?! This you should also</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>know: if I had no care for myself and for those souls that are with me, I would have taken</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your letters and gone and shown them to the judges and to the leading members of the community. However, out of kindness I forbore and also because</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I became sick and drained, and perhaps I should not rest until I have  come [to you]. And your daughter didn’t want</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to accept a divorce deed from me, and she cried out and said to the  leading members of the community ‘How can I accept</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a divorce deed and leave behind my children and my son-in-law?!’ And they too accorded you blame for what you did.</p>
</li>
</ol>
