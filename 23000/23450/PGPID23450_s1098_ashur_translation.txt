verso

The slave of the excellent, honourable, precious, diadem of glory,
the crowning turban, our master and our teacher Moses the Great Rav,
the strong hammer, the […] heaven, may our God prolong
his days in prosperity and his years in delight for the sake of the merits of he who was
advanced in age (=Abraham, the patriach), of he who is bound like a lamb without blemish (=Isaac) and of he who ministered with the Urim and the Tumim (=Aaron).
May it be the will of the Rock of Ages
that He be a refuge and a shelter to him, for the sake of the merits of Aaron and Moses.
And may He be a protection and an aid to him for the sake of the merits of Daniel and Ezra.
Furthermore, my master, what you want to know is that
the letter of my master (=your letter) has arrived. I have read it and understood
its contents, which is, my brother, that this wine was deposited
with Umm Manṣūr …
