He said: &ldquo;I was with the cantor, &lsquo;The Diadem&rsquo;&mdash;may God accept him with favor&mdash;when</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wu\u1e25sha, the broker, came in and said: &lsquo;Do you not have an advice for me? I had an affair with \u1e24ass\u016bn</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and conceived from him. We contracted a marriage before a Muslim notary, but I am afraid</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>that he may deny being the father of my child.&rsquo; She then lived in the house of Ben al-Sukkar\u012b</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>on the uppermost floor. He (the cantor) said: &lsquo;Go and gather some people, and let them surprise you with him so that your assertion might be confirmed.&rsquo;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>She did so, gathering two who surprised her with him, and confirmed her assertion. She was then</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>pregnant with this Ab\u016b Sa&rsquo;d, her son, whom she had conceived in her illicit relation with \u1e24ass\u016bn. I know also</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>that she went on the Fast of Atonement to the synagogue of the Iraqians, but when</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the N\u0101s\u012b of blessed memory noticed her, he expelled her from the synagogue. I know</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all this for sure, and deposit herewith my testimony to this effect. There appeared also in court</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the ritual slaughterer Ab\u016b Sa&rsquo;\u012bd \u1e24alf\u014dn ha-Kohen, son of Rabbi Joseph ha-Kohen&mdash;may he rest in Eden&mdash;and deposited the following witness in our presence:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"I was living in the house of Hibat Allah Ben al-Sukkari&mdash;may God accept him</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with favor&mdash;on the ground floor for many years, while Wu\u1e25sha, the broker,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>had her domicile in the uppermost part of the house. In those days, she came down once to one</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of the tenants, namely Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r, the Kohen, the cantor Ben al-K\u0101mukh\u012b, and to Abraham</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Jerusalemite, known as the son of the mrh\u1e6d, and said to them: &lsquo;Please,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>come up with me to my room for something.
