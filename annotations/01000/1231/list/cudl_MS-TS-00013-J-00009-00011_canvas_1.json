One of the students of our lord came forth (from the capital, apparently) and told your servant (i.e., the writer) on behalf of our master that you would not be ready to execute the matter under after the holiday. You had earlier generously promised to execute the matter as it was known to you. Your servant is in a desperate situation in all his affairs and I ask you in your munificence not to neglect me but to pay full attention to my weak state (meaning, poverty) and desolation. The knife has reached the bone. My greatest adversity is in the matter of this creditor and the fact that he is one of the better people, so that he is justified and I am the one who wrongs him and myself. I do not blame him, for I have fallen in with him because of my many sins. The purpose of this (petition) is that when my master meets with the illustrious head, our master and teacher R. Abraham the great Rav, may his glory be exalted and his honor increased, you, my master, should tell him what you know to be the truth of your servant&rsquo;s situation and ask him to procure 60 dirhems in any way possible and send for the creditor and ask him to divide the sum into installments of 10 dirhems per month. That is what he requested, since he knows (my) situation. He is well aware of my extreme predicament. The writ in his hand divides it into 20 dirhems per month. Let it be promised to him that the 60 dirhams be paid in six monthly installments. If that is done, it will be help from God by the merit of our lord. The matter is easy. The matter can be paid off by the end of Passover, God willing, with the help of our lord and by the merit of his father, (may) the m(emory of) the r(ighteous be) b(lessed). Your servant has informed you of this after having kissed your feet. May the welfare of his excellence our holy lord, increase forever and never diminish. Forever, sela amen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Some of the students of our lord (the Nagid) came out (from the capital) and mentioned</li>\n<li>to (your) servant on behalf of our master that he (the addressee)&nbsp;would not be ready to finish</li>\n<li>the matter until after the holiday. He (the addressee) had previously generously promised</li>\n<li>to execute the matter as it was known to him. The servant is</li>\n<li>in a desperate situation in all his affairs. He (the petitioner) asks</li>\n<li>of his (the addressee's) munificence not to neglect him, but to protect him in his weak state</li>\n<li>and isolation. The knife has reached</li>\n<li>the bone. His greatest adversity is in the matter of this creditor</li>\n<li>and the fact that he is from among the extreme people (a\u1e6dr\u0101f al-n\u0101s). He is justified, whereas I am</li>\n<li>unjust toward him and myself, and I do not blame him; I have fallen in with him</li>\n<li>_because of my many sins_ (Heb.). The purpose of this (petition) is that when</li>\n<li>the master (the addressee) meets with the illustrious head (of the Jews), our master and teacher Avraham, the great rabbi, may his glory be exalted</li>\n<li>and his honor increase, my master should inform him what he knows</li>\n<li>to be the truth of your servant&rsquo;s situation and ask him to procure</li>\n<li>sixty dirhams from anywhere possible and send for</li>\n<li>the creditor and ask him to divide the amount into (installments of) ten</li>\n<li>dirhams per month. For this is what he requested when he learned of</li>\n<li>the situation (in which I find myself). He is well aware of my extreme predicament, since the legal document in his hand</li>\n<li>divides it into twenty dirhams per month. Let it be promised</li>\n<li>that the sixty dirhams be paid in six monthly installments. If</li>\n<li>that is done, it will be help from God _by the merit_ (Heb.)</li>\n<li>of our lord. The matter is easy. The matter can be put off until the end of</li>\n<li>Passover, God willing, with the help of our lord and _by the merit_</li>\n<li>of his father, may the memory of the righteous be a blessing. The servant has informed (you) of this, after having kissed</li>\n<li>his (the addressee's) feet. May the welfare of his excellency, our saintly lord,</li>\n<li>increase forever and never diminish. Forever, sela amen.</li>\n</ol>",

He informs him that he had presented to his excellent seat (court), may it be elevated, a note containing some details about his state. Then one of our lord's disciples came out and mentioned to his servant in the name of our master that it will not be possible for him to take care of the matter until after the holiday. But he already gave his generous (or: eminent) promise to take care of that with which he is familiar. His servant is at the point of ruin in all of his affairs. He asks of his grace not to neglect him and to give complete attention to his weakness and his estrangement. For the knife has already reached the bone. And his greatest calamity is the business of this creditor and the fact that he is of the upper class, so that he is justified and I am the one who wrongs him and myself. And I do not blame him, for it is because of my many sins that I have fallen in with him. The objective of this (petition) is that when our lord meets the venerable head, our master and teacher Abraham the great rabbi, may his majesty be elevated and his honour increased, he should inform him of what he knows to be true about his servant's affairs and request him to secure sixty dirhems any way possible and to send for the creditor to ask him to agree that the sum be paid in instalments of ten dirhems per month. For he (the creditor) sought this, since he knows the situation and is well aware of the difficulty I am in. For the bill that he holds is payable in instalments of twenty dirhems per month. And let it be promised to him that the sixty dirhems be paid for a six month instalment. If this is done, it will be support from God, because of the merit of our lord - If the matter is made little of, and the affair is postponed until after Passover - if God wills, this will be with the assistance of our lord and the merit of his father (may the) m(emory of the) p(ious be a) b(lessing). His servant has informed him of this after having kissed his feet. May the peace of our excellency, our holy lord, increase and never decrease. Forever, selah, amen.</p>",
