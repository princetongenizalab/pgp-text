Avraham, (may he) r(est in) E(den), and of his son</li>\n<li>Ab\u012b l-Khayr. Then I pondered over the straitened circumstances of these people, their liabilities</li>\n<li>and indebtedness to the d\u012bw\u0101n and thought that if I took that thing (al-b\u0101b)</li>\n<li>from them through machinations (siy\u0101sa), force and getting the better of them, they would suffer damage,</li>\n<li>both from the side of (their relation with) the d\u012bw\u0101n and their loss of income. Thus, considering their welfare</li>\n<li>prior to my own and confident that with God's favorable decree and help the welfare of</li>\n<li>all of us would be served, I make this proposal. Of the debts of</li>\n<li>these people, I pledge to pay to the d\u012bw\u0101n 80</li>\n<li>dinars //in the course of four years//, 20 dinars each year, not more than that. Whatever might be above</li>\n<li>that sum I am not obliged to pay. This on condition that the</li>\n<li>superintendent (mushrif) and director (\u02bf\u0101mil) grant me the tax farming at the same estimate and price</li>\n<li>imposed on them at present without any rise and that</li>\n<li>they also relinquish the lease (\u1e0dam\u0101n) and transfer it to the aforementioned elder Ab\u012b</li>\n<li>l-Ri\u1e0d\u0101 (i.e., me) without rise.\" The aforementioned declared</li>\n<li>that the estimate of the lease (\u1e0dam\u0101n) imposed on them amounted to</li>\n<li>335 d\u012bn\u0101rs. If the superintendent</li>\n<li>and director would be prepared to transfer the lease solely with a rise, then</li>\n<li>the rise would be included in the sum of 80 dinars mentioned before, and</li>\n<li>the elder Ab\u016b l-Ri\u1e0d\u0101 would not be obliged to anything more than</li>\n<li>80 dinars for both payment of their debt and a possible rise.\" On these conditions</li>\n<li>the symbolic purchase was made by us from the aforementioned elder Ab\u016b l-Ri\u1e0d\u0101 and also</li>\n<li>from the aforementioned elder Ab\u016b l-Faraj and his son especially on their obligation</li>\n<li>to transfer the lease (\u1e0dam\u0101n); we made it completely and strictly, valid as from now,</li>\n<li>in the prescribed manner, voiding all secret depositions and stipulations. This happened</li>\n<li>during the first ten days of the month of Elul, 1458. Correct, valid and confirmed.</li>\n<li>(Signed by) Zakkay b. Moshe, (may he) r(est) i(n) E(den). \u02bfAmram b. R. Ya\u02bfaqov, (may he) r(est) i(n) E(den).</li>\n</ol>",
