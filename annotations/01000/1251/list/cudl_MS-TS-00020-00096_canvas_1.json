With the revenues from the rent for two years&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;according to the account that they made and which part of the community read in the synagogue, they constructed the large front&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;of D\u0101r al-Sabb\u0101gh. In the years [42]8 and [42]9 they built D\u0101r Qu\u1e6day\u1e6d and accommodated al-Jamal in it.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;In the year [4]30 they built some of the remaining part of D\u0101r al-\u1e62abb\u0101gh. In the year [4]30 they surrounded&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;the synagogue with a wall and installed on the synagogue the chords of the vault . Also, after that they built&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;the two low apartments in the upper part of D\u0101r al-\u1e24aff\u0101r, known as D\u0101r Maym\u016bn b.

Before&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;the synagogue was closed the account of these years was fastened from Passover until the \"Small Fast\", and (a ban) was proclaimed&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;several times against whoever had any objection to it and did not appear before the court. It was said also that&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;this was an obligatory duty, and not (simply) some kind of good deed. Those who were authorized to request it, requested</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;that we write our signatures and titles at the end and this we accepted ....</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
