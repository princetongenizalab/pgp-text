Japheth the elder, son of M. and R. Tiqv\u0101, the elder, the Friend of the yeshiva-may he rest in Eden-concluded a match with Sitt al-Kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63a, his fiancee,</li>\n<li>a virgin, the daughter of M. and R. Berakh\u014dt, the elder-may he rest in Eden. His obligation is a first instalment of 40</li>\n<li>&nbsp;certified dinars, to be given as a gift at the time of the wedding, and a final instalment of 100 certified</li>\n<li>&nbsp;dinars. Ab\u016b Man\u1e63\u016br \u1e62ema\u1e25, the fiance, presented the 40 dinars of the first instalment,</li>\n<li>&nbsp;and the elder Ab\u016b \u02bel-\u02bfAl\u0101 Musallam, the perfumer, son of Sahl, received them from him. The wedding is set for the month of</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Kislev of the coming year-may we be destined for life in it-which is the year 1459. \u1e62ema\u1e25 assumed these obligations toward Sitt al-Kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63a: She</li>\n<li>will be regarded as trustworthy in all that concerns food and drink</li>\n<li>in the house, no suspicion may be cast upon her, nor can he demand from her an oath concerning any of these</li>\n<li>&nbsp;things, not even a supplementary oath. He may not marry another woman, nor retain</li>\n<li>&nbsp;a maidservant whom she dislikes. Should he do any of these things, the final instalment is hers, and he must</li>\n<li>&nbsp;release her [from the marriage bond by divorce]. In the case that there are no children, half of what remains of the dowry returns to her family. She may choose the place</li>\n<li>and the domicile where she wishes to live. The rent of her properties is hers, she may spend it for whatever purpose she prefers;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;he has no say in the matter. Should he nullify this engagement contract and not</li>\n<li>marry her during the said Kislev, she will receive 20 dinars. This is a debt</li>\n<li>and an obligation, binding [as from now]. We made the symbolic purchase from M. \u1e62ema\u1e25, the young man, for Sitt al-Kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63a, the fiancee,</li>\n<li>according to all that is recorded above, a purchase which is definite and strict, made with the proper object for such a transaction.</li>\n<li>We also made the symbolic purchase from Sitt al-S\u0101da, the daughter of the elder Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r, the physician, the mother of Sitt</li>\n<li>&nbsp;al-Kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63a, the fiancee, in the most rigorous terms, binding as from now: Should her</li>\n<li>daughter Sitt al-Kh\u0101\u1e63\u1e63a nullify the engagement contract and refuse to marry</li>\n<li>&nbsp;the fiance during the said month of Kislev, she would owe the fiance</li>\n<li>&nbsp;20 [dinars ... J This has taken place after the verification of her identity.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Signatures: Mev\u014dr\u0101kh b. Solomon [of] b[lessed] m[emory]. Sadaqa b [.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
