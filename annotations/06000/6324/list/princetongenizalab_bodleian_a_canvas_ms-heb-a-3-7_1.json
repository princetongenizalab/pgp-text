Thus: [Mr. Shemariah ha-Kohen]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>known as Ab\u016b al-Waf\u0101 [b. Manasseh ha-Kohen &hellip;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>N\u0101qid and demanded of the Elder Ab\u016b al-Mun\u0101 (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Isaac [the&nbsp; Elder b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Judah]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the Elder, al-Dimashq\u012b (who) r(ests in) E(den,) nine dinars and a sixth stating t[hat he&nbsp; ...]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>his son Ab\u016b al-Karam by way of a partnership (shirka) in manufacture of g[lass &hellip;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>his in al-Na\u1e25\u1e25\u0101s\u012bn, for the sale of copper, and the Elder A[b\u016b al-Waf\u0101] asked us [&hellip;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>and we have separated [&hellip;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>that to this Elder Ab\u016b al-Mun\u0101, and he responded to the oath and stat[ed &hellip;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Elders of equity and propriety by way of settlement. And they attested that [the Elder]&nbsp; this [A]b\u016b al-Mun\u0101 would p[ay] to this Ab\u016b al-Waf\u0101</li>\n<li>ha-Kohen in din[ars &hellip;] in a single (payment), and he absolved him of [&hellip; all that&nbsp; which he he claim]ed therein,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>and he absolved his son Ab\u016b al-Karam [&hellip;] and others and from all&nbsp;</li>\n<li>claims and demands and from all that which could be defined whatsoever. And the&nbsp; two of them have separated completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Each of them is satisfied with what the Elders have established concerning this. This&nbsp; Elder Ab\u016b al-Mun\u0101 brought&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the dina(rs) which the compromise required of him, and he gave it to Nahr\u0101y the son of&nbsp; Ab\u016b al-Waf\u0101 for the matter of&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>his father. It came to him completely and totally. Then he said to us, &ldquo;Testify&nbsp; concerning me&mdash;I,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Shemariah ha-Kohen, known as Ab\u016b al-Waf\u0101 b. Manasseh ha-Kohen (who) r(ests in)&nbsp; E(den). Perform a kinyan with me as of now,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>write and sign on my behalf, using all the appropriate legal formulae and expressions of&nbsp; certainty&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>and using all the language of claims, and give it to the Elder, this Ab\u016b al-Mun\u0101 (our)&nbsp; tea(cher) and m(aster) Isaac //the Elder//&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>b. (our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Judah the Elder al-Dimashq\u012b (who) r(ests in) E(den), in&nbsp; order that there would be in his hand from this day forward proof and a legal claim&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>that I attest before you using the most certain and perfect expressions of affirmation, in&nbsp; my good health&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>and freedom of will, willingly, with neither duress nor force nor compulsion, with&nbsp; neither negligence nor error, nor&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>defect of illness within me, nor anything of the like from all the factors which nullify&nbsp; testimony, that I have absolved him&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>from now, and I have absolved his son Ab\u016b al-Karam and all who have recourse to the&nbsp; two of them, from the partnership (shirka) concerning which I am currently suing,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>in which the two of them are obligated, as well as any connection which I could direct&nbsp; against the two of them concerning the capital or concerning the profit,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>(nor a claim of) deception, nor a claim that he trusted him, nor any of the like from all&nbsp; the claims and demands&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>and from all the connections and responsibilities which could be directed towards each&nbsp; of the two of them together&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>or as individuals, or upon their heirs after them. And (they are released) from everything&nbsp; which proceeded between me and between the two of them&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>in this aforementioned partnership (shirka) and in (partnerships) other than this, from all&nbsp; which proceeded between me and between the two of them&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>in all types of financial transactions (mu&lsquo;\u0101mal\u0101t) of different sorts and types, from the&nbsp; beginning of&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>time until now, from all that which could be defined whatsoever, and from all the oaths&nbsp; concerning&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>anything therein, grave and simple, and rider oaths and even herem setam;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;a complete, total, effective, terminating, certain release, severing all other claims&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;and demands, a release through receipt and acceptance, an irreversible release, with no&nbsp; stipulation&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;weakening it and no argument nullifying it, a release from me in my lifetime and from&nbsp; my heirs after me, all of the/m,/&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;in his life and to his heirs after him, with the most certain and perfect expressions of&nbsp; release, and as a decree of&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;the Sages, since nothing remains for either of them with me&mdash;neither a claim nor a&nbsp; demand, nor any connection, and I have&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;obligated myself before the two of them to fulfill the release, upon me and upon my&nbsp; heirs after me, with the most certain [guarantees]&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>of delivery. And I wrote this document for the two of them that it would be in their&nbsp; hand and in the hand of theirs after them&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;upon me and upon my heirs after me, well-ordered, proper and enduring and durable,&nbsp; according to which they will be successful in any court&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;of justice, not like formularies or like prototypes of documents, rather as the most&nbsp; certain and most perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;of that which was outlined by our Sages (may their) m(emory be) f(or a blessing), in the&nbsp; like. I have [also] nullified [all] secret dispositions and conditions which may be made&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;for me and which we have made concerning this document, as a decree of the Sages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>And we performed a qinyan with Mr. Shemariah ha-Kohen, known as&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>this Ab\u016b al-Waf\u0101 b. al-N\u0101qid b.
