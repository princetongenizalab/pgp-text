And they both agreed that the mohar will be forty gold dinars, of which he will pay in advance ten gold dinars at the time of marriage, which is set to take place by the month of Nisan 1469 Era&nbsp; of Documents. And there will remain incumbent on her thirty gold dinars, good, excellent. And [here are] the well-known conditions imposed by the daughters&nbsp; of Israel: she will be regarded by him as trustworthy in all matters concerning food and drink and any claim. And that he will not marry another woman as long as he is with her and will not keep a slave girl disliked by her, and if he will do any of the above he has to pay her late installment. And her earnings will remain in her possession. And if the month of Nisan 1469 [1158 CE] arrives and he will not marry her, the aforementioned Abu al-Wafa, the fianc&eacute;, testifies upon his oath, in&nbsp; our presence, when he is in the soundness of his mind and freedom of his will, that he has in his possession ten Egyptian dinars as a complete debt for the aforementioned Sitt al-Than\u0101, the fianc&eacute;e, [to be paid] if he will change his mind and will not marry her on Nisan 1469. We performed a qinyan with Abu al-Waf\u0101 on the above mentioned conditions, a complete and weighty qinyan with a legal instrument fit&nbsp; for doing so, effective immediately, in accordance with his will, without any sort of compulsion, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions. Afterwards, we performed a qinyan with Sitthum, Sitt al-Than\u0101&rsquo;s mother, [who testifies] that she has&nbsp; in her possession ten dinars as a complete debt, [to be given,] effective immediately, to Abu al-Waf\u0101 the fianc&eacute;, if her daughter Sitt al-Than\u0101 will change her mind and refuse to marry the aforementioned Abu al-Waf\u0101 on the date agreed upon. We performed a qinyan with Sitthum regarding the above, after we approved her identity, a complete and weighty qinyan effective immediately, in accordance with his will, without any sort of compulsion, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions. And everything is valid. &lsquo;b. R. Abu al-\u02bfAl\u0101&rsquo; is written between the lines. And everything is valid. (Signatures) Saadya b. Abraham, may he rest in Eden. Elazar Hakohen b. \u02bfAtiyya Hakohen, may he rest in Eden. </p>",
