Your slave is&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in great distress due to the false accusations about me and my father. Hitherto I have been&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>silent, but it has become necessary to justify myself and my trustee (i.e. her father). I do not want to&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>answer them. I have today. I have been arguing with them from the day I married into (their family)&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>until now so that they will not take anything from me. On Wednesday, he secretly took&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>he bench (martaba), the pillows and the supporting pillow. He was not content with them,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and no sooner did he sell them, than he came demanding from me something else. When I refused&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to give, he beat me with something that should not be mentioned. Next day in the morning,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>he told me: &ldquo;Get up and leave to your father&rsquo;s house. Because if I come back in the evening (and find you here),&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I will kill you.&rdquo; By the truth of the shar\u012b\u02bfa, it is he who told me &ldquo;leave!&rdquo; I sent (a letter)&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>telling my lord about my going out of the house. My lord prevented him from doing it. I obeyed&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you and stayed (at my husband\u02bcs house). When they saw me staying, the quarrel between us intensified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Saturday, my mother came to ask about me. He and his father said, &ldquo;If I satisfy (your wish),&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you shall pay my poll tax every year, otherwise, save yourself (and go away) lest I kick you out (also possible: destroy you).&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All your life you come up with justifications for yourself. He has no (financial) need of me.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He has four dinars worth of wine (nab\u012bdh) at his possession and he has no need of me. His mother&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and father tell him, &ldquo;Beat her until she breaks.&rdquo; Whenever&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;I mentioned to them the divine law (al-shar\u02bf), they cursed the divine law. When&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I saw them the evil increased from them. They tell me: &ldquo;Leave!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
