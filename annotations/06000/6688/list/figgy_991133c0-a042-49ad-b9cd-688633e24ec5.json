David the trustee of the merchants in Aden, and a shipment of clove are mentioned.]&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now in one of your letters you adjure me to set you free, then letters arrived from the old man saying the same. Later Ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b (\"Eloquent\") b. al-Daj\u0101j\u012b (\"Seller of Fowl\") met me and told me that you came to his house before he set out on his travel. You had given him nutmeg paste as a collateral on a loan of 100 dirhems, but he released 20 dirhems to you. Please let me know whether this is correct, in which case I shall return this sum to him. He reported also that you had asked him to return to you letters which your late father&ndash;may God have mercy on him&ndash;had sent with him, but he had said to you: \"I have already packed them away on the boat.\" Then you said that these letters were not written with your consent and you asked him not to deliver them to me. On this Ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b had replied: The judge might have meanwhile sent a message demanding something from the elder, in which case the delivery of these letters might be useful to him.</p>\n<p>Now, if this is your wish, I cannot blame you. For the waiting has been long. And I do not know whether the Creator will grant relief immediately so that I can come home, or whether matters will take time, for I cannot come home with nothing. Therefore I resolved to issue a writ which sets you free. Now the matter is in your hand. If you wish separation from me, accept the bill of repudiation and you are free. But if this is not your decision and not your desire, do not lose these long years of waiting: perhaps relief is at hand and you will regret at a time when regret will be of no avail.</p>\n<p>And please do not blame me, for I never neglected you from the time when those things happened and made an effort to save you and me from people talking and impairing my honor. The refusal was on your side, not on mine. I do not know whether this is your decision or that of someone else, but after all this, please do not say, you or someone else: this is our reward from him and our recompense. All day long I have a lonely heart and am pained by our separation. I feel that pain while writing these lines. But the choice is with you; the decision is in your hand: if you wish to carry the matter through, do so; if you wish to leave things as they are, do so. But do not act after the first impulse. Ask the advice of good people and act as you think will be the best for you. May God inspire you with the right decision.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>G. Greetings, Errands, Gifts</p>\n<p>[The concluding part is very much damaged. It began in the margin, much of which is lost, continued in the main part of the page, and returned to the margin, but was never completed. Clearly the letter was not dispatched; see also the introduction. Only continuous sentences are translated.]</p>\n<p>[Best regards to my sister] and her husband, the illustrious elder Abu \u02bel-Fa\u1e0d\u0101\u02beil, the scholar, to Ma\u02bfani, the scholar (?), and his son. I have exerted myself for him to a degree that only God knows. The elder Abu \u02bel-Khayr (\"Mr. Good\") agreed to pay him 10 mithq\u0101ls (Egyptian dinars), which the elder Abu \u02bel-Mak\u0101rim (\"Noble Character\") will deliver to him.</p>\n<p>Convey my greetings to the elder Abu Is\u1e25\u0101q, the son of your paternal uncle, to his mother, to the elder Abu \u02bfImr\u0101n and his children, to [...]j, the daughter of your paternal uncle, and to all those whom you know, my most sincere regards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I sent you 7 &frac12; mann of nutmeg, which is better than anything found in the K\u0101rim and worth more than other sorts of it by 1 dinar; 11 mann of good galingale; two futa cloths for the children; 2 &frac12; of celandine and 25 of odoriferous wood; fourteen pieces in number.</p>\n<p>[Repetition of some greetings and other matters from above.]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
