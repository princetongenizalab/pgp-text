Accordingly, he obligated himself to this in our presence and also (agreed) to cease his former practice of ruling some people coercively while currying favor with</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>others, and, if God so decrees, to administer from this day forward the affairs of the community,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>whether small or big. An exception was made concerning those religious matters that require the fixing of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>dues and punishments, there being no shame in this. Moreover, he is to act prudently</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when presented with difficult matters of that sort and the like</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and to solicit the opinion of His High Excellency about them&mdash;may his splendor be exalted. He accepted our instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(12-13) concerning all this, whereupon we reinstated him in his position and place by affixing our signatures at the end of this document, after His Excellency the rayyis&mdash;may his splendor be exalted and his honor in(crease)&mdash;had so directed,</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>and (restored) him to the muqaddamship over al-Ma\u1e25alla and all the other districts of the countryside. We wrote a document for him also. We know</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(15-19) that the upright notables, renowned for their good qualities&mdash;may God watch over them and protect them&mdash;who refused to be present in the same place with him, will find this decision acceptable and will speedily make profitable use of it, even though it seems painful or difficult to them. (We know) that they will do what is proper</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>(19-21) and return to doing what is best, and that they will guide them- selves by their superior rightly guided intellectual facul- ties so as to be acquitted before God and man, whether</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>it is to their advantage or disadvantage. It is incumbent upon them&mdash;may they be blessed in heaven&mdash;to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(22-23) understand the times and to know what the world faces, namely, that these are times when no Jew should persist in hatred and con- tention, which means</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>enmity and opposition, or in any desire for worldly things at all. Rather they must</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>strive toward controlling their desires for such things and should act humbly and contritely</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>before God&mdash;may He be exalted&mdash;since \"There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord&rdquo; Therefore they should act kindly</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and in a friendly way toward this noble man and help him in (the work of) God&mdash;may He be exalted In this way, they will be causing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(28-29) gatherings of Jews to listen (once again) to the words of the Torah and to be urged to observe the commandments and to do good deeds, which stand as a shield against bad times. Then perhaps the Lord of Hosts will be compassionate and merciful toward the remnant of</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is(rael) and bring about their redemption speedily in our days and in yours by His mercy. This is the most proper and correct thing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for them to do and the most righteous act they could perform either in this world or the next The Creator of all&mdash;may He be exalted and blessed&mdash;will not overlook their</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>forbearance in this matter and their patience regarding him and their return to Him who does not withhold the reward of any creature</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in this world. The open rectification of this matter, O Israel, will not be hidden from any intelligent and religious person.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your noble community, which is renowned for its good qualities, has been attentive to these two</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>illustrious attributes. May the Creator of all, for His great name's sake, bring us and you to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(36-37) right-guidedness and success in this and other matters. This is a matter, O Israel, that can not fail to earn you&mdash;God grant you long life&mdash;the praise of His High Excellency&mdash;may his splendor be exalted&mdash;</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>and his thanks.
