An exception was made concerning those religious matters that require the fixing of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>dues and punishments, there being no shame in this.

He accepted our instruction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(12-13) concerning all this, whereupon we reinstated him in his position and place by affixing our signatures at the end of this document, after His Excellency the rayyis&mdash;may his splendor be exalted and his honor in(crease)&mdash;had so directed,</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>and (restored) him to the muqaddamship over al-Ma\u1e25alla and all the other districts of the countryside.

It is incumbent upon them&mdash;may they be blessed in heaven&mdash;to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(22-23) understand the times and to know what the world faces, namely, that these are times when no Jew should persist in hatred and con- tention, which means</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>enmity and opposition, or in any desire for worldly things at all. Rather they must</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>strive toward controlling their desires for such things and should act humbly and contritely</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>before God&mdash;may He be exalted&mdash;since \"There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord&rdquo; Therefore they should act kindly</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and in a friendly way toward this noble man and help him in (the work of) God&mdash;may He be exalted In this way, they will be causing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(28-29) gatherings of Jews to listen (once again) to the words of the Torah and to be urged to observe the commandments and to do good deeds, which stand as a shield against bad times. Then perhaps the Lord of Hosts will be compassionate and merciful toward the remnant of</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is(rael) and bring about their redemption speedily in our days and in yours by His mercy. This is the most proper and correct thing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for them to do and the most righteous act they could perform either in this world or the next The Creator of all&mdash;may He be exalted and blessed&mdash;will not overlook their</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>forbearance in this matter and their patience regarding him and their return to Him who does not withhold the reward of any creature</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in this world.
