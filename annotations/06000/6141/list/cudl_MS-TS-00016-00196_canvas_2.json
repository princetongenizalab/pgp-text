Scripture says of God&mdash;may He be exalted and blessed&mdash;\"He pardons iniquity and passes by transgression.\"</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now we know that the phrase \"He pardons iniquity\" means the same thing as the phrase \"He passes by transgression\"&mdash;may He be exalted and blessed. Therefore, the interpretation of this verse must be</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>that out of the abundance of His illustrious and just manner He is wont to pardon and forgive those who</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>are accustomed to pardoning and forgiving others. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you&mdash;may you be blessed&mdash;to honor him (Joseph) and restore</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>him to his former position. Noble men like you know how weakened his position has become. May the Creator of all</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bring about through your hands all good qualities and protect you and enable you to d(o)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>His will. And may your welfare increase.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
