The ruling about the matter is two-fold. First,</li>\n<li>if the head of the house (ust\u0101dh al-d\u0101r) said to all the partners &ldquo;I granted and exempted&nbsp;</li>\n<li>you from the entirety of the penalty that you should have paid for those lost money (or goods) of such-and-such amount of dinars because of&nbsp;</li>\n<li>such-and-such my partner&rdquo;, his saying this is valid and. By saying this, he commands them&nbsp;</li>\n<li>that they will not be repaid anything; or Simeon says to Reuben &ldquo;I will work as much as I can&nbsp;</li>\n<li>to collect what could be collected from this money (or goods), except that whatever I collect</li>\n<li>will belong to me&rdquo;, then after that whatever the other partners payed, Simeon will not owe</li>\n<li>any of it since they stated that partners who were forgiven part of their taxes by the tax-collectors, what they have been remitted&nbsp;</li>\n<li>falls to the common fund.</li>\n</ol>",
