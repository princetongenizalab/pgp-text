Learning of your well-being and the good state of your affairs, my lord, gave me pleasure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I thanked God, the Exalted, much for this and pray that He&mdash;may His praise be glorified!&mdash;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>increase all good for you and let me hear from you good news</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>always, perpetually, through His kindness and abundant benevolence. I, your servant, was distressed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>very much by the causes of your complaint, your sorrow and grief over</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>what befell the late Sheikh Hiba b. Ab\u016b Sa\u02bfd, your son-in-law, my lord,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>namely that he and his partner the Kohen drowned, and that you had to undertake the support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of your daughter&mdash;may God protect her!&mdash;his wife, from the time he set out on his journey until now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have been afflicted by the same grief as you, my lord, and more so,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for a number of reasons: the anguish over the ship and its contents, since it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and most of its cargo belonged to our Nagid \u1e24alfon&mdash;may his grandeur be elevated and his honor increase!&mdash;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and there was no one here who did not have some merchandise on the ship, everyone according to his amount,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>including me, your servant, and others. Also the anguish over our two coreligionists, mentioned above,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and over two of our Adenese coreligionists, who were in</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the ship and who were married in Aden. So there was general grief, from every aspect.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But there is no stratagem against what God, the Exalted, has decreed. This is what God decreed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for them. This was their destiny. Let it be far from us and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the house of Israel! God save us from an end like this!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I pray to Him, blessed be His name, that He make the outcome good for my lord&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and for us and for all of Israel, in His abundant mercy and benevolence. You requested,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>my lord, that I, your servant, inform you how the tragedy befell</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the two men mentioned above when they drowned and that I endeavor for your sake to secure the release of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the young woman and her share in what remains from her husband&rsquo;s estate,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in Aden. Be informed&mdash;may I never know of any bad day for you!&mdash;that my explanation&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to you can be divided into three categories, since they are what is called for</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>here. The three aspects are: eyewitness accounts,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>news heard at second hand and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>what legal pronouncements there might be, whether clear-cut or otherwise, based on proofs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>found in the statements of our sages. These are the details of their drowning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ship they were in, that is the K\u016blam\u012b, sailed from Aden together</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with the other ships that set sail. This ship and the</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bar\u012bbatan\u012b were in the same position. The two of them traveled together for about four&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>days out of Aden. On the eve of the fifth day, the sailors of the</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bar\u012bbatan\u012b heard the cries of the sailors of the K\u016blam\u012b</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and their screams and shrieks in the night as the water inundated</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>them. When morning came, the sailors of the Bar\u012bbatan\u012b</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>did not encounter any trace or evidence of the K\u016blam\u012b, because</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from the time the two had left Aden they had kept abreast of each other.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The two did not separate until this tragedy befell</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the K\u016blam\u012b. This happened before they entered the Ma\u1e63abb.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Afterwards there appeared a ship&rsquo;s wood and furnishings,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>which were new, on the shore of Abyan and Shi\u1e25r, and some of them were conveyed&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to Aden. There was no new ship with new rigging other than</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the K\u016blam\u012b among the ships of that year, the year of the sinking of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of the K\u016blam\u012b. \\\\This is the report of some of our coreligionists concerning this and the report of some of the Bar\u012bbatan\u012b men concerning//\\\\the K\u016blam\u012b as well, made in the presence of the signatories to this letter.// Also there arrived travelers in ships</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from the year in which the K\u016blam\u012b sank and the next year as well.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Recto, right margin</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Travelers arrived in these two years in</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ships from every sea: from all the lands of Hind and its provinces,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from the land of the Zanj and its provinces, from the inland region of Berbera and Abyssinia and their provinces</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and from Ash\u1e25\u0101r and Qamar and their provinces. All</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the travelers came to Aden in those two years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And no news came to light of the K\u016blam\u012b or whoever was in it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not even one man, at all,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>no trace, no report, not anyone, who could tell an</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>eyewitness account from someone who had been in it, not anyone who</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>could tell a report in his name, he or anyone who was</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in it, except the story of the sailors of the Bar\u012bbatan\u012b,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>which was sailing with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nothing else. Some say also that the new furnishings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of the ship, which were found</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>on the shore of Abyan and Shi\u1e25r, could</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have been from one of the ships of the land of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Zanj or from some other ship, which was not</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from the ships of Aden. No one disagrees,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>rather all concur, that any</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ship that sinks in the environs of Aden,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>between the Ma\u1e63abb and Aden, never</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>surfaces, nor does anyone who</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>was in it survive at all,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>because of the turbulence of the sea and the f[orce of its waves]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>at {alt. Tr.: &hellip;and the distance from} the beach and the abundance of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>fish (sharks).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
