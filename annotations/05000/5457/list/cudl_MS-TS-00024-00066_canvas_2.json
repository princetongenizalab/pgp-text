Ab\u016b</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Gh\u0101lib, the ship\u2019s captain, has with him also a purse, in which there are 20 Egyptian mithq\u0101ls,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>worth 47 dinars (Malik\u012b).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That purse contains (also) seven Malik\u012b dinars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The total sum: 535 \u2153 dinars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This settles my lord\u2019s account.

The betel nuts, which</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you sent to your servant, also arrived, and this is on {alt. tr.: against} the balance of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>my account with your excellency {alt. tr.: which you owed me} from last</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>year. But the betel nuts were extremely mediocre, both the white</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and the red ones. There also arrived what you were kind enough (to send), namely four\u00a0</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>locks and two qa\u1e63\u02bfa-bowls. Your servant has sent to you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with Ab\u016b Gh\u0101lib, the ship\u2019s captain, two large brazilwood boxes with</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sugar, and two brazilwood boxes with raisins, and a package with</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>three dasts of Egyptian \u1e6cal\u1e25\u012b paper of the best</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>obtainable quality. Please accept this, my lord,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and may you think well of me!
