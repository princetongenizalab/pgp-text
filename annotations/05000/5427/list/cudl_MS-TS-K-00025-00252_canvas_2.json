The betel nuts, which</li>\n<li>you sent to your servant, also arrived, and this is on {alt. tr.: against} the balance of</li>\n<li>my account with your excellency {alt. tr.: which you owed me} from last</li>\n<li>year. But the betel nuts were extremely mediocre, both the white</li>\n<li>and the red ones. There also arrived what you were kind enough (to send), namely four\u00a0</li>\n<li>locks and two qa\u1e63\u02bfa-bowls. Your servant has sent to you</li>\n<li>with Ab\u016b Gh\u0101lib, the ship\u2019s captain, two large brazilwood boxes with</li>\n<li>sugar, and two brazilwood boxes with raisins, and a package with</li>\n<li>three dasts of Egyptian \u1e6cal\u1e25\u012b paper of the best</li>\n<li>obtainable quality. Please accept this, my lord,</li>\n<li>and may you think well of me! If you have any</li>\n<li>need or service (to be done), I would be happy {lit., \u2018give me the pleasure\u2019} to take care of them.</li>\n<li>May you have abundant well-being!
