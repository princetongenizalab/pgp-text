I won't ask for anything else from you again until the end of next month, Shevat. I am owed the same amount by Ibn al-Dihq\u0101n. I have no more patience over this delay, etc. I am in straits, warding off my worst instincts, knowing as I do about my situation. Please be beneficent with that which God has given to you or accredit my account with your brother for what I owe him. May your welfare increase and not diminish.
