I am from the land of Persia and I live in the synagogue. I had enough to live on (lit., \"to cover myself with\"), but I lost it, and I remain without a pittance. I came to this city empty-handed, intending that I would support myself by serving the people, but I fell sick with smallpox. Now I cannot function and I possess nothing. So I have written this petition to your excellency my master, hoping you would help me out with something. I am singling you out with this request and no one else because of your renown and repute (for generosity). May God never terminate your position. By my brother, I have never uncovered myself and would not have had to had not necessity brought this about. I am looking forward to the favor of God the exalted and to the favor of my master. May God never put my master in need or humble him. O master, do not turn me away disappointed but do for me as you do with others and \"let not the downtrodden turn away disappointed,\" etc. (Psalm 74:21). May the welfare of our lord increase forever, Amen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
