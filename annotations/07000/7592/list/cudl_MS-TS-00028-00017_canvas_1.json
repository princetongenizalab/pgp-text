Joseph and D\u0101\u2019\u016bd and \u1e62edaqa, sons of \u1e62ema\u1e25 b. D\u0101\u2019\u016bd al-Raqq\u012b personally \u2026</li><li>and their names and their family-names; Ya\u2018q\u016bb b. Joseph brought them on Monday on the eighth</li><li>of the month of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n, that they would record and testify to all that which proceeded between him and between D\u0101\u2019\u016bd and \u1e62edaqa</li><li>these brothers, the sons of \u1e62ema\u1e25, as a partnership (shirka)\u00a0between them, for a dispute broke out between them, </li><li>and when these brothers, D\u0101\u2019\u016bd and \u1e62ema\u1e25, appeared at the appearance of witnesses, this Ya\u2018q\u016bb </li><li>b. Joseph began and said to them, \u201cKnow that I have not called you today to these (people) to a court judgment</li><li>but rather I have called you to testify. So testify to that which proceeded between us in terms of oral statements</li><li>and admissions, and record that for us, from the oral statements that we are acting deliberately and intentionally </li><li>in accordance with the first (thing) that Ya\u2018q\u016bb said to these two brothers, D\u0101\u2019\u016bd and \u1e62edaqa, \u2018I will swear </li><li>before you, by God, great and mighty, and by His Torah, and by all Israel, concerning all</li><li>your questions, if you correctly report that which God, great and mighty, knows, with neither falsehood nor</li><li>concealment nor fear nor bias, since it would not help you with me, for I am not lost to</li><li>your judgment after today.\u2019\u201d Then the oath was repeated for them \u2026 then he returned</li><li>and the brothers responded together, saying, \u201cYes, we accept the oath upon ourselves. We</li><li>are only speaking the truth and the facts which God, great and mighty, knows.\u201d Then he (Ya\u2018q\u016bb) said, \u201cWas it not </li><li>before your (re)payment of that which I paid to the merchants, which I found with you!\u201d The two of them said,</li><li>\u201cYes.\u201d Then he said to them, \u201cDid you have the profit, (my) dear, to which I am entitled, because</li><li>I am concerned.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have anything of yours, (my) dear.\u201d But indeed I found (something)</li><li>for myself (therein). Then I pressed upon \u1e62edaqa, the younger brother, and said to him, \u201cBefore</li><li>your brother\u2019s arrival, when you came from the road and you presented your alibi, did I take </li><li>something from you or (even) demand from you something or (even) a promise, (my) dear?\u201d \u1e62edaqa said, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThen, by God, testify</li><li>about him concerning all that he said.\u201d Then he said to Bishr, \u201cWhen you showed up, something (that is, a business arrangement) proceeded between you and me</li><li>as we mentioned.\u201d And he responded, saying, \u201cAs God is my witness, I never heard from you even on a single day\u2014</li><li>not before, not after\u2014concerning this situation.\u201d //And he said, \u201cNo.\u201d// Then he said to both the brothers, \u201cAre you not</li><li>with \u2026 I sold the merchandise with which I was involved, \u2018eating of the (Paschal sacrifice)\u2019?\u201d </li><li>\u2026 for it, a final sale, not completing the total, and I spent the funds upon myself in [\u2026]</li><li>\u2026 since \u2026 he did not \u2026 me the way of \u2026spent for the business. I assigned</li><li>such (and such) your business, and I did not wish to take any of the merchandise upon myself.\u201d The two of them said, \u201cYes,\u201d acknowledging </li><li>before you all that which I said. Then he said to them, \u201cHave I not opened the store for you, by the eye</li><li>of great and mighty God?\u201d I said to you, \u201cI owe you nothing further. Ask me for my maintenance, but beyond that,</li><li>I will not use my high position for any sort of help that you that you might need.\u201d You said,</li><li>\u201cWe don\u2019t have (the money for the re-)payment, nor (can) we complete anything without your sitting (and working) with us.\u201d And indeed, you harassed me</li><li>until I granted your wish and sat with you as a partner, such that I (would receive) half of (what) we (received), may God give us success, and the two of you (would receive) </li><li>the (other) half.\u201d Then he said to them, \u201cAfter a month elapsed, did I not see that your situation was good, (yet) </li><li>I was not compensated. So I gathered before you all the Elders and we wrote a detailed description between us. We testified</li><li>to all the stipulations which were in that description. And indeed, that (very) night you invalidated it with your statement\u2014</li><li>you, O \u1e62edaqa! If you did not want the produce and the keys, then I will work in (times of) trouble and pestilience</li><li>for myself (and not for the partnership)\u2014though I wanted you to have the keys and the produce.\u2019\u201d And the two of them said, \u201cYes.\u201d Then he said to them, </li><li>\u201cConcerning what I did during whole period in terms of buying and selling\u2014does it go into the</li><li>big and small scale, or do I receive food as payment or a measure of produce to be taken to the money-changer, or also </li><li>\u2026 or an error happened between us and between the money-changer and a business agent and an agent in the payment or a fraction of it.</li><li>The two of them said, \u201cNo.\u201d Then he said, \u201cConcerning that which we purchased and sold from the first day (of the partnership), did we sell comething</li><li>at a loss?\u201d He said, \u201cNo\u2014rather, we did so for a profit.\u201d Then he said to them, \u201cDid I take some of the profit from the store </li><li>other than ten dina(rs) in addition to whatever was established in the detailed description\u2014which was (itself) a (single) din(ar)? They took it each </li><li>Friday and divided it\u2014half for me and half for you\u2014for a period of 15 months.\u201d And he said, \u201cFurther,</li><li>other than that which I mentioned\u2014that is the ten din(ars) and a half\u2014the rest of the profit of the store is for you </li><li>each Friday.\u201d Then he said to them, \u201cTell me that there is a going concern in the store with what I paid\u2014four thousand din(ars)! </li><li>How can one not suggest that there will be an equivalent amount of profit! I would like the rest of the profit, and that</li><li>which I claimed from you (in) this joint enterprise (mu\u2018\u0101mala) for safekeeping.\u2019\u201d The two of them responded and said, \u201cO assembly of </li><li>Elders, a store from which thirty din(ars) comes every month for our debts, may he claim profits</li><li>more than this amount therefrom since he is this Ya\u2018q\u016bb?\u201d The witnesses present said, \u201cRecord concerning them and preserve (this)</li><li>testimony, with all the decisions in //that which// I examined them. Testify to me therein in your presence, and record </li><li>the testimony. When he demanded the testimony from us, we testified and gave it to him as a valid proof from today onward.</li><li>Mubashir b. Fah\u012bd (who) r(ests in) E(den) \u00a0 \u00a0 Ma\u1e63lia\u1e25 b.
