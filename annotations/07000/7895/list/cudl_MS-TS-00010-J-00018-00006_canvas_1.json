El[ijah].</li>\n<li>\n<p>The reason which prompted the sending of this paper to my dear brother, \u2013-</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the distinguished elder, Abu'l-Faraj, The Glory of the House of the Exilarch, may God perpetuate his honored position</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and establish his prosperity, and may we be united with your pleasant countenance - God on high be willing ---</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>is my great longing for you. I have sent to you one letter through Isma''i'l</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and one letter through another person, but have received no reply. There have arrived</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>many Alexandrians, not one of them bearing a letter. So I have</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>become worried for you, and thought you might be ill. For we did not think that you have been hindered</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from [writing] us save by a compelling reason. Also, before this,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there came a woman - and I don't know who she is, except that Sitt Ghaza'l knew her; she sent</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with her a letter to take care of my aunt Umm Abu'l-'Izz</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>because she traveled to your place. Also, when she left, she promised her daughter</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to write her a letter so that she be assuaged, and so that we be assuaged about her well-being</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and her safe arrival there. I have, therefore, been quite astonished about this thing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>May God, then, calm our hearts by letting us hear about you that you are well,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>as are your dear relatives. Your daughter is quite well and lacks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>nothing, save being able to gaze upon you, and save your not forgetting to inquire about her in your dear letters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0] all. I ask, since you are so kind, that you take good care (of that woman) whom God commands</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>us to honor, and do not be remiss with her. We know how virtuous you are</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and how much you care for her. May you be amply rewarded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Peace be upon you, your wife, your dear brother and his wife and children, your father</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0perfect peace, sublime goals, and honor.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
