And the court asked him to bring witnesses&nbsp; [shuhud] to support his story, and he brought two witnesses: Shabbat b. Ma\u1e25fuz al-Ban\u0101 and Abu al-Khayr, both from Alexandria. And they both&nbsp; testify that they both recognize the signatures of the witnesses that are&nbsp; signed on the deed [shetar], and that they were both present in Alexandria at the time the aforementioned Hil\u0101la received the bill of divorce&nbsp; [get] which had been written for her, from her husband, the aforementioned \u02bfIw\u0101\u1e0d. After the court approved all of the above, he [\u02bfIw\u0101\u1e0d] asked&nbsp; to marry [j\u012bza] in Fustat. Then we joined him [and went to the house of&nbsp; the prospective bride] and he engaged Sitt al-Khuw\u0101t, daughter of Elijah, may he rest in Eden, the divorc&eacute;e of Judah Halevi, son of Manasseh, may he rest in Eden, in our presence after we had examined her bill of&nbsp; divorce, which is dated to the 11th of Av 1442 Era of Documents [8 July 1131], and it was also approved by us. And they both agree that the&nbsp; advance payment [muqdam] &nbsp;[to the bride] will be four dinars, as a gift&nbsp; from the time of the wedding, of which he [now] brought two dinars,&nbsp; which were given to Yi\u1e25ya Halevi, son of Abraham, her sister&rsquo;s husband,&nbsp; [in trust] for her, together with a silver ring, in a capacity of deposit [&lsquo;al\u0101 sab\u012bl al-wad\u012b&rsquo;a]. And regarding the two remaining dinars, it was agreed&nbsp; that he shall give them to her at the time of marriage. And the delayed&nbsp; payment [muakhkhar] is twelve dinars, good, excellent. And the marriage was set to take place on the month of Sivan of this year. The fianc&eacute; undertook to pay her, in the event that he cancels the marriage, four&nbsp; dinars, as a gift. And [he also undertook] that they will live in Fustat. He&nbsp; also stipulated that whenever he should ask her to accompany him and visit his family she will not prevent it, as long as he will return her to&nbsp; Fustat. And Yi\u1e25ya, her sister&rsquo;s husband, guaranteed on her behalf that if&nbsp; she will ask to cancel the marriage, he shall pay four dinars as a present&nbsp; to the fianc&eacute;. We performed a qinyan [a legally binding act] between the&nbsp; fianc&eacute; and the aforementioned Yi\u1e25ya, with respect to each and every one&nbsp; of the things ascribed above,&nbsp; a complete qinyan with a valid legal instrument fit for doing so, effective immediately, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions. And we wrote and signed it concerning what was&nbsp; performed before us so that it will stand as a title of rights and as proof.&nbsp; All of this took place on Tuesday, twenty-fifth of Nisan, 1443 Era of Documents [12 April 1132], in Fustat, Egypt, situated on the river Nile under&nbsp; the jurisdiction of our Master Ma\u1e63lia\u1e25 Hakohen, the Head of the Yeshivah of Ge&rsquo;on Ya\u02bfakov, &nbsp;may his position be established forever. Strong,&nbsp; firm and valid.[Signatures] Nathan Hakohen b. Solomon Hakohen, may&nbsp; he rest in Eden. \u1e24alfon Halevi b. Mannase, may he rest in Eden. \u02bfIw\u0101\u1e0d b.&nbsp; Zedaqa, may his end be good.&nbsp;</p>",
