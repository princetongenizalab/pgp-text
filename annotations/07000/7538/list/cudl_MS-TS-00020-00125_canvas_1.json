Whereas there came to our attention the state of affairs in our esteemed and beloved communi[ty] in al-Ma\u1e25alla&mdash;</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;may God bless them and keep them, help them, guard them, and plant among the[m]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>love, fraternity, peace, and friendship and remove from their [mids]t enmity,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>jealousy, hatred, and contention, and protect them with His abundant mercy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and lovingkindness, as follows: the community has become split and a breach has occurred among its members;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>most of them have become idle on Sabbaths and holidays,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sitting most of the time in the streets and shops or in the shade of sycamores on thos[e] days</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and, thereby, spurning the synagogues; this has come to pass due to the absence of someone to guide them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>toward what is proper and away from what is not</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and someone to supervise their disputes and litigations and remind the[m]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of what is forbidden and permitted; the words of the Torah and the commandments have ceased to be heard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And whereas there appeared before us a number of our coreligionists reporting</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>this, stating among other things that it had all come to pass upon the departure of</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(his) h(onor), g(reatness, and) h(oliness) (our) ma(ster) and t(eacher) Joseph ha-Levi the \u1e25aver, etc., from their midst and that the latter used</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to prevent people from engaging in this sort of thing, and that some members of the community there</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>had resolved, in accordance with what they believed to be right [and] out of convictio[n],</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not to associate with him either in gatherings or in the synagogue. . . .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>His Excellency our lord&mdash;may [his splen]dor be exalted&mdash;was distressed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>by the fact that this had been going on for two years to date. A letter was therefore written to them informing them how</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>His High Excellency has suffered on account of the breach that has occurred.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He left the matter unattended all this time, hoping that things would return to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>normal, that truth would show itself on its own, that the pursuit of passions would cease,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and that the correct path would be sought and be established among them&mdash;may God protect their honor. He indicated</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(31-32) how he felt and the cause of the aforementioned resolution, hoping that what religious law and truth demand would be put into practice. However, none of this was carried out. When there appeared (in court)</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>a certain person who reported that disorder still persisted in that pl[ace] as well as in the othe[r]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>places, and that this was on account of the removal of the hand of the above-mentione[d] person, whereas we ha[d n]o one</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to assist us by going there to close the breach except</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the above-mentioned \u1e25aver, and whereas he is anxious to uphold the words of our God and strives</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to exhort others to fulfill the commandments, and whereas this matter can be left unattended</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>no longer, especially given the agitation of our informant,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we, therefore, summoned him (Joseph) and exhorted him to improve his character and informed him</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>whence came his difficulties with the people who</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(41-v., l. 1) stated that they would not associate with him, namely, [poor g]overnment (on his part) and insufficient regard for the consequences thereof. Thereupon we made him agree to c[onduct] the affairs</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
