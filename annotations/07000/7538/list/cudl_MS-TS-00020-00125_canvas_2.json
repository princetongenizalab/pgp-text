Whenever</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>presented with a difficult matter [of this sort] in a case under litigation, he shall act prudently</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and solicit the opinion of His Excellency our lord&mdash;may his splendor be exalted. Thereupon he (Joseph) obligated</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>himself to us concerning that which we had agreed upon and guaranteed that he would fulfill it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(12-13) Accordingly we judges, ordained by His Excellency our lord, by our agreement and the agreement of the elders sitting with us, decided</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>(14-15) to reinstate him over al-Ma\u1e25alla and the other districts of the countryside, in his former capacity as one ordained by His Excellency our lord. We considered this to be</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>our duty from the point of view of religion and government,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and because a matter affecting so many communities and congregations cannot be left unattended</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>on account of a few people who say: \"We have resolved not</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[to assoc]iate with him.\" If, on the other hand, they [pre]fer taking the initiative</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in this matter and doing what is demanded, that would be worthy of them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Likewise, if they decide to do [the] right thing on their own, taking cognizance of the fact that His Excellency our lord</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&mdash;may his splendor be exalted&mdash; has shown ample indulgence toward them, and return to that which is worthy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of them regarding conscientious attendance at the synagogues, performing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>good deeds, and multiplying charitable acts, how much more deserving would they be.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>But if&mdash;by God&mdash;they do not do this but rather deem it appropriate to (continue)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sitting in the[ir hou]ses . . . God willing, that is up to them. It is necessary</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>that they be aware of the current state of affairs and of what the world faces</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(line mostly effaced)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>(through) a[c]ts of chanty, elimination of inner resentments, mutua[l] forgiveness,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>shedding of grudges, pursuit of the paths of repentance and by returning to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Creator&mdash;may His praise be exalted&mdash;and begging His forgiveness. Then He in His Mercy will take pity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and have compassion upon us and upon you and upon all His people the House of Israel and will speed the coming</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of the herald of peace, the bearer of glad tidings, the herald of salvation [in] our [day]s and in yours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is, therefore, your duty&mdash;may God protect you&mdash;to respect him, support him,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>accept his commands and prohibitions with a pleasant countenance, and act toward him</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in your usual kind way, so that, in turn, we will receive a letter from him thanking you, thereby increasing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>our own gratitude toward you.
