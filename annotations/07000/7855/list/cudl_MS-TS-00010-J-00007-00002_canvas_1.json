We made the symbolic purchase certified in</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>court. Your letters had come to the elder</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Abu'I-Suru'r the Kohen, and to the elder Abu'l-T'a'hir.

I had sent you a letter from Bilbays</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with Abu H'ayyu'n (in which I said) that you should pay him the rest of the sum you owe for the turban and the</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>two rugs which are in the possession of Ibn al-S'abba'gh, if you have safely delivered them</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to him. If you have not delivered them to him, deliver them to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rabbi Abraham, the bearer of the letter, because we haven't got anything</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for expenses. I await your letter.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
