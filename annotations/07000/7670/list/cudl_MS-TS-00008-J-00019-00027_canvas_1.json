I am writing from Ramie on the 8th of Teveth (approximately:\u00a0January), feeling well in body, but being worried in\u00a0my mind.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I set sail\u00a0for Jaffa, the port of Ramie. But a wind arose against\u00a0us from the land. It became a storm, chasing and driving us out\u00a0to the high sea,\u00a0where we remained for four days, giving up all\u00a0hope for life. We were without sails and oars, the steering rudder\u00a0and the sailyards were broken, and the waves burst into the barge\u00a0(qarib). We cried: \"Allah, Allah,\" for our ship was a mere riverboat (ushari), small as a ferry (ma'diya). We threw part of the cargo\u00a0overboard, and I gave up all hope for my life and my goods. I vowed\u00a01 dinar from the proceeds of the silk.\u00a0Finally, God in his glory and majesty granted us to reach Caesarea, but my clothes and goods were\u00a0completely soaked. I did not find a place to stay and to spread out\u00a0my things. So I took domicile in the synagogue, where I remained\u00a0for five days.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>When I arrived in Ramie, I had to pay customs to a degree I am\u00a0unable to describe. The price in Ramie of the Cyprus\u00a0silk, which I\u00a0carry with me, is 2 dinars per little pound.\u00a0Please inform me of\u00a0its price and advise me whether I should sell it here or carry it\u00a0with me to you in Misr (Fustat), in case it is fetching a good price\u00a0there. By God, answer me quickly, I have no other business here\u00a0in Ramie except awaiting answers to my letters. About 3 dinars\u00a0worth of goods of mine were jettisoned from the barge; may God,\u00a0the exalted, restore the loss. If you want me to carry the silk with\u00a0me, instruct Makhluf b. Muhsina\u00a0(write him!) to pay me 2-3\u00a0dinars, or have Ab\u016b Barhun\u00a0write to his brother Ya'qub (Jacob)\u00a0to give me this sum so that I do not have to sell my clothing or\u00a0the silk.\u00a0A man like you does not need to be urged. I know that\u00a0my money and yours\u00a0are one. Moreover, you have a share in this.\u00a0I need not stress the urgency of a reply concerning the price of silk\u00a0from Sham (Syria-Lebanon) and from Cyprus, and whether I\u00a0should sell it here or carry it with me.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>I wrote you from Tripoli and informed you that I had sent four\u00a0bundles of cotton and twenty-one pieces\u00a0of figs to Alexandria. I\u00a0wrote to M. Marduk,\u00a0asking him to receive this shipment. With\u00a0Yahya b. al-Zaffat sent two bags and one basket with wheat, red\u00a0earth,\u00a0and two baskets with raisins and figs. I instructed him to\u00a0deliver these to Marduk. Your share in the basket (of wheat)\u00a0and the figs is 8 dinars, and your share in the silk also 8 dinars. I\u00a0hope you have written to Alexandria instructing Marduk to take\u00a0care of the matter, and also to attend to the sacking (khaysh). Also write him to send you either the proceeds, or the goods to be\u00a0bought for them, or broken dinars.\u00a0And by God, answer. I have\u00a0no business other than waiting for your letter. By God, do not\u00a0neglect this. By the bread (we have eaten together), as soon as this\u00a0letter arrives, send the answer to the warehouse of the representative\u00a0of the merchants, Abu \u038a-Barakat Ibn al-Hulaybi.\u00a0A man like\u00a0you needs no urging.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Describe to me the prices in the city (Fustat), and especially with\u00a0regard to wheat and bread\u2014I need not urge you to write me about\u00a0this\u2014as well as concerning the state of my father and the family.\u00a0Special regards to you, and also to those who ask about me. Please\u00a0honor me with any concern you might have. Regards also to Joseph and his mother.\u00a0How are they ? Regards also to our friends. And\u00a0Peace.</p>\n<p>(Address:)</p>\n<p>To my lord and master Abu Yahya Nahray, son of Nisslm, (may\u00a0he) r(est in) E(den), may God prolong his life and make permanent\u00a0his honored position, strength, and happiness.\u00a0From Ya'qub (Jacob) b. Salman al-Hariri (Repeated in Arabic characters. What follows is also in Arabic\u00a0characters:)</p>\n<p>To Fustat, the House of Exchange, the office of Ibrahim b.
