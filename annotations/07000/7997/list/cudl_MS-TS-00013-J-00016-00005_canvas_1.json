May God, then,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>help you in religious as well as worldly affairs for His sake. And may the merit</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of your father (the virtuous and honorable master, who fulfills (the commandments) and knows them well) intercede for you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>as well as for us.

Your house is the beauty of the community,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>may God give you success so that He, the exalted, may be satisfied with it, and may He also give us success for the sake of His name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We inform you, may your strength not cease, that a young woman - her name is Bushr - a daughter of Asad</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>son of al-Sali'ar, the auctioneer in the bazaar of the wool-merchants, came with her mother</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nasab, daughter of Abu'I-Mans'u'r, to court, in order to marry her daughter,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the one named Bushr - a young woman who is of age - to a</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cairene. We then inquired about her and asked a man of her people who knows her - - -</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Abu' al-'Ala\" son of al-Nusha'diri', the silk merchant \u2014 and they said</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>that this young woman - being of age - was engaged to a young man.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We could not establish anything certain about their case, and what happened to them,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from which it could become clear that a connection between them no longer exists and which would therefore remove any doubt in the matter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our lord, therefore, may his glory be exalted, ordered that we write to our patron</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a letter in which we would inform him of the matter, so that he would write us an unequivocal</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>letter about their affair - quickly, for her mother</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>mentioned that she appeared before your late father of blessed memory</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and it was in your presence and in the presence of the revered colleague R. Solomon, (may his) Ro(ck) prese(rve) him,</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
