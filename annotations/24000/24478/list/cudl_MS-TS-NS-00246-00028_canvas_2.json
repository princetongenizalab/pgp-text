But I do not want and do not desire to free [her].</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now when she pressed me with her words, I had to mislead her&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and to act according to her wishes and to mislead the daughter of her slave girl, whose name is&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>X, (to think) that I am making her a free woman. But it is not my will nor&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>my desire to free her nor to emancipate her. The deed&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>of emancipation which I have written for her is void and is like a potsherd&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>thrown in the street which is worthless and is not to be relied upon at all.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And with this intention I have deposed my words before you. Write&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for me (a deed of) evidence.\" So we wrote for him this disclaimer and we signed (it) and gave (it) to h[im], for it to be in the possession&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;of A son of B as evidence and as proof. Ratified, confirmed and valid.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And this took place on the Xth day, such and such of the month Y.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
