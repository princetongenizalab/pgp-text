The aforementioned (Merki) released the aforementioned \u02bfUbayd All\u0101h, \u27e6the debtor\u27e7, who expressed his thanks,</li>\n<li>a release of receipt in full. It was written by Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b in his hand, in the</li>\n<li>last ten days of the month of Rama\u1e0d\u0101n of the year five- hundred and sixteen (23rd November&ndash;2nd December 1122 AD).</li>\n<li>Merki ibn Abr\u0101m, the freedman of the rightly-guided, prosperous, just judge, Trust of the Kingdom, \u02beAb\u016b al-\u1e34ayr \u02beIbr\u0101h\u012bm ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-\u1e24usayn</li>\n<li>ibn al-Zubayr, asked me to testify with regard to himself, while he was in health, while his acts were legal, and he acted willingly, that he has received in full from \u02bfAbd All\u0101h, a freedman, substituting for his father,</li>\n<li>a quarter, a sixth and an eighth of a d\u012bn\u0101r, in gold coinage of al-\u02be\u0100mir, full weight, of good alloy, on behalf of his debtor \u02bfUbayd All\u0101h ibn \u1e24asan,</li>\n<li>who is named on the recto; and he released him from that with a release of full receipt; and that the remainder that is owed to him by his debtor is a quarter and two sixths</li>\n<li>of a d\u012bn\u0101r, in cash. It was written by \u02bfAl\u012b ibn \u02bf Ubayd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Turk\u012b in his own hand, in the last ten days</li>\n<li>of Shaww\u0101l, in the year five-hundred and sixteen (22nd&ndash;31st December 1122 AD). That was after he had received a legal injunction against him for the remainder, which was written by \u02bfAbd All\u0101h</li>\n<li>ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Tawf\u012bq ibn \u1e24usayn in the last ten days of Shaww\u0101l of the year five-hundred and sixteen (22nd&ndash;31st December 1122 AD).
