I have great longing for him and I, therefore, ask God that we shall meet</li>\n<li>soon. As for other matters, O brother, what he needed has been conveyed from what remained from the price of the two baskets</li>\n<li>of cotton, which were with our brother Mufli\u1e25, namely thirty-two dirhams. If he has brought pure coins, then receive them and convey to me a share.</li>\n<li>If you cannot obtain pure coins, then send to me their value. But</li>\n<li>trust me and leave it to me. On another matter, when I arrive from my long journey, I shall set off again,</li>\n<li>and when I collect it at your place, if it is with you&mdash;you know what my view is about this.</li>\n<li>I am grateful only to God, the Exalted. It was a terrible year for me and a terrible journey.</li>\n<li>Best wishes to you and to our brother \u1e24usayn greetings and to our brother the freedman greetings.</li>\n</ol>",
