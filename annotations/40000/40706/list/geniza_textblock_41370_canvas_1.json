I sent letters concerning these items with everybody who was travelling to you. If you would (kindly) determine to send something, then please send it,</li>\n<li>and inform my son Ma\u1e25m\u016bd that I have sent to him a letter informing him about the veils that will reach him andthat</li>\n<li>arrangements have been made for him to be witness of documents.
