We read, examined, verified</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;and confirmed with complete certainty that she is owed according to it (i.e. according to the ketubba) by her husband, the aforementioned Mr. Yakh\u012bn,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>seventy-fi[ve] dinars, from which twenty- five are actual dinars6 and fifty dinars are a dowry, according to the custom of the land,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for which she is owed by him a third, that is 16 2&frasl;3 dinars. According to this ketubba, she is&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>trustworthy in respect to him as long as he live and in respect to all his heirs after him as two trustworthy valid witness. After the aforementioned&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ketubba was confirmed by us with complete certainty,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the aforementioned Si[tt al-]Kull said to us: &ldquo;Know, O court, that my husband has tarried7 in Fustat (Mi\u1e63r) and abandoned me more or less s[ix or read: seven]&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>years ago. He travelled without depositing maintenance with me, nor what I&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>or his daughter may be sustained with. I am still waiting patiently; [perhaps] he will return or send me and his daughter [what]&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we may be sustained with. Now, the matter has become very difficult for me and I have nothing left to be succored with. I do not know&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>what to do. Therefore, I ask to appoint Ibrah\u012bm b. Ab\u016b al-Khayr as my proxy to go to my husband, the aforementioned Th\u0101bit&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>b. Shabbat to sue him for the maintenance I am owed by him, from the time he left until today.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If he chooses [ ] to me [ ] in all that is due to me from my aforementioned ketubba,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>delayed marriage gift and dowry [....] and will give it to him&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[... ] and bear witness for me [</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
