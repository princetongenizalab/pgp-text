We suggested that (the money) be designated for its restoration, but she said</li>\n<li>\"No.\" She acquitted her brothers of all claims and demands, they being as <i>trustworthy</i></li>\n<li><i>as two reputable witnesses</i>. She stated that she owes the son of her sister 7 1/2 dinars</li>\n<li>and (another) 4 dinars.
