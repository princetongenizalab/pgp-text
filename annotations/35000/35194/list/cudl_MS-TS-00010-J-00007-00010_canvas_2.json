Shabb\u0101t said to us, \u201cBear witness for me testify on my own behalf through all the expressions</li>\n<li>of the court and all the types of testimony that I report to you that I own a third</li>\n<li>of a d\u0101r in Qa\u1e63r al-Shama\u02bfa in partnership with my sisters, and a third of a d\u0101r next to the funduq al-dhahabi (\u201cthe gold hotel\u201d)</li>\n<li>in partnership with her sister\u2019s son, and two qir\u0101ts and two \u1e25abbas [=2/24+2/72=0.11] in partnership with her sisters the Ikshadiyya d\u0101r.</li>\n<li>And she owns an enslaved boy who is to be sold, and his price is to be divided in equal halves: half for the</li>\n<li>Dammuh pilgrimage and the other half to remain with the court [as charity] to pay death expenses for someone who has nothing</li>\n<li>or for people who are on the hook for taxes and don\u2019t have anything because of it. We (the witnesses) relayed to her what</li>\n<li>was said by the Diadem,<i> may his Rock [God] preserve him, Nezer ha\u1e24averim</i>, that in the synagogue of the Iraqis and the</li>\n<li>Palestinians there are books [bibles?] whose price is everything. And we said to her that [she could pay] the price of restoring them. But she said</li>\n<li>no. Then she freed her sisters from any [future] lawsuits or claims, [declaring] them as trustworthy</li>\n<li>as two kosher witnesses. And she acknowledged that she owes the son of her sister seven and a half dinars</li>\n<li>and four of the dinars should be paid from her heirs, and the seven and a half dinars</li>\n<li>and the four dinars should be retrieved from her two sisters. And she acknowledged that she owes her slave</li>\n<li>two dinars. And six dinars to the daughter of her brother Ab\u016b \u02bfAl\u012b al-Kohen. And we made a <i>qinyan</i> with</li>\n<li>her sisters that they would be the guarantors (<i>\u1e0dam\u016bn darak</i>) for the aforementioned twelve dinars\u2026</li>\n<li>of the whole and what they need to get from her heirs. <i>And peace</i>.
