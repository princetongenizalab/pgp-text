Meshullam my partner, in order that he would have proof</li><li>and a legal claim effective immediately. This happened in accordance with my free will, not under duress or compulsion, nor the like from any</li><li>of the factors which nullify testimony, but rather with a full heart and a desirous spirit, I attest before you that I have settled (my) account with him in</li><li>[\u2026] \u2026 dinar. \u00a0I, Abraham ha-Kohen, have received </li><li>\u2026 which is that \u2026 from this aforemen[tioned] twenty dinars</li><li>which are allocated to me from this stock \u2026 and I have no (further right) therein (to claim) from him, \u2026 nor any claim, and he terminated me \u2026</li><li>\u2026 work from today onward on his behalf, I have no claim upon him in this dispute, nor claim nor any demand concerning all</li><li>the causes and reasons neither //in that which// he has transacted therein, nor in that which he has worked therein in the production of weaving \u2026</li><li>And now each of us will work and labor for himself.

We performed a qinyan wi[th Abraham]</li><li>ha-Kohen b. Daniel and with M(r.) Obadiah b. Meshullam, concerning everything written and specified above. Proper and enduring. That [which]</li><li>happened before us, we wrote and signed //on Thursday, the twenty-third day of the month of Tammuz, of the year one thousand three hundred// and we gave it to M(r.) Obadiah b.

I have absolved him o[f \u2026]</li><li>And now, each of us will work //from today// onward on his own behalf. I have no dispute, nor a claim, nor any claim concerning all conc[erning] all that he has done</li><li>for any cause or reason, neither in that which he transacts therein, nor in that which he partners therein, since we have separated,</li><li>each of us working for himself, for profit or loss.
