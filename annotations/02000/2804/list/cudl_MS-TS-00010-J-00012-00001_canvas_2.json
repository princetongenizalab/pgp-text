          "value": "<ol>\n<li>\n<p>My life worsened further. She was arrogant to me through this boy of mine and the baby girl&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>that I maintained, with the poll tax that I had to pay. My livelihood in al-Ma\u1e25alla dwindled.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I became irritated (lit. my chest tightened) as my fortunes with women turned upside down. For I used to gaze at a wife (lit. a house) who had no equal&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>at all, whereas this kind of wife is unfit for a friend or an enemy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I entered the little one into a kutt\u0101b because he is seven years old today. I do not have with me a&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>bible. Because of that reason I told you about, if you have something with you from&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the days of the deceased, M(ay his) M(emory be blessed), that will show his (i.e. the writer&rsquo;s seven year old son) favor with you, give it as a present to Abu&rsquo;l-Hasan (i.e. the writer\u02bcs son). For he is (like) your own son to the point that he&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>asks me for you and always says to me &ldquo;my lord, show me my uncle!&rdquo; I did not know&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>anything afflicted you until Ab\u016b&rsquo;l-Sur\u016br met me and told me what happened&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to you with Ya\u1e25ya, the Elder, may he be remembered for his evil deeds by the divine law whose&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>power we all know. It saddened me, as whenever something is revealed about one of us, and especially you! May God, the exalted, punish him and may he not shame us by his reputation&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>more than already took place. What happened to you with him will have no effect. Moreover, you will go&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with him to the military commander, (let) someone else punish him! And now, my uncle, I do not&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have any other pain that you (would) want to see, more than this matter. I am&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in a state of fear regarding these people (i.e. the Ibn Sabra family) for I want to raise him and how will God help me&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to be free from them? For they have made me grow old before my time! How I threw&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>myself down like a camel! I did not rush to Fustat to procure in it what I want,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>instead, I have taken from the countryside the things I needed like &ldquo;Harvest is past etc&rdquo; (Jeremiah 8:20). I ask from&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your kindness that you will not inform him of my situation nor where I am. For if it reaches (him), he will&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>attain shame among Jews. These people and I are in</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;such a situation! So strive to remove about me the wrong opinions. I also sent a letter to&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>inform my first in-laws that they should not inform him where I am. Send me (a letter)&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>informing me what happens with him, whether he is in the city or outside of it. Perhaps&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>he would encounter on the road what others encountered and we will not be picky.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In short, (tell me) everything that happens to him for he is my link to (what) I had in my previous life: he and his mother.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with them (i.e. the Ibn Sabra family) are fifty dinars. They did not inform me of what is with them at all. Nor did they acknowledge to me&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>anything. While I carried them (on my expense) as if they were guests! The old&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and the young treated them with honor out of respect to me. After that she joined him, obeyed him&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and went behind him. A son of Israel buried her, may God attach her&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to Him.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
