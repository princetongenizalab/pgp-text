Whatever (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram, does this with this counterparty of mine,</li><li>M(r.) Ma\u1e25b\u016bb, with respect to all //that with which he was entrusted therefrom// is acceptable to me effective immediately. I cannot say to (Mr. Amram), \u201c(I retained you) to fulfill my (agency)</li><li>and not to misrepresent me.\u201d Likewise, further, I have appointed (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram //to appoint// whomever he chooses of his (own) will,</li><li>that which he sees fit is as though I saw it fit, and whomever he appoints as though I, Moses, have appointed him. I am not able to sue (him) for</li><li>anything he does. Everything that is imposed by the court of law, I accept upon myself, effective immediately, whether for (my) credit or for (my) debt,</li><li>for this Mr. Amram and for whomever he might appoint and stands in his place. Likewise, further, I have declared (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram</li><li>to be trustworthy in his word as two proper witnesses, who is (therefore) not obligated in any oath of any</li><li>type, even rider oaths and even \u1e25erem setam. He is also free from all types </li><li>of oaths and he is completely free and completely released (from any obligation), both in (my) heart and by means of oral (testament), in this world</li><li>and in the world to come. Further, I have declared that effective immediately his agent will be trusted //as two proper witnesses// concerning the matters of this settlement, and I have taken</li><li>upon myself responsibility for all this\u2014upon myself and upon my heirs after me\u2014for (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Amram,</li><li>and upon his heirs after him, as (this agreement) is not like promises and not like formularies, but rather</li><li>(bears) the weight and force of documents of the court which the Sages enacted and which are universally followed, from this day forward,</li><li>forever, nullifying all secret dispositions and conditions which would nullify anything from this power of attorney. We, </li><li>the witnesses, performed a qinyan\u00a0with this Mr. Moses b. Abraham and with (our) tea(cher) and master, this Amram b. (his) h(onor,) gr(eatness, and) ho(liness)</li><li>(our) tea(cher) and m(aster) Joseph the \u1e24asid, concerning all that is written and specified above, with an item suitable for doing so.</li><li>Proper and enduring. We wrote and signed and gave it to (our) tea(cher) and m(aster), this Amram, in order that he would have in his hand</li><li>a title of right and proof. Hanging: \u201ceffective immediately\u201d : \u201cif he appoints\u201d : The above is enduring and this is its confirmation. Upon an erasure:</li><li>\u201cand a judg(ment)\u201d : Enduring and this is its confirmation.</li></ol>",
