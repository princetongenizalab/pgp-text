[[B\u016b Wafa]] Hayyim b. Immanuel-may God always keep him - to show it to my lord, the Rav.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Up till now I have not received an answer on this, nor do I know what has been done</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>with regard to the estate [of our master Berechiah]. Sheikh Abu Zikri charged&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>me for the price of the books, which were bought for me out of the estate of our master&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Berechiah (of) b(lessed) m(emory) with 8 dinars. I sent him silver, which he sold for&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>12 dinars. Whereupon I received a letter from him, in which he says that he</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&nbsp;would spend the balance due me on the price of what he [[has copied]] had ordered to copy for me, but he gave me no details about&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>what was copied. I wrote him inquiring what [[he had copied]] he had ordered to copy, asking him to [[copy]] order to copy the Commentary on Hezqat ha- Batt\u012bm (Bava Qamma, ch. III) in the format I sent to him.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, I did not receive a letter from him, either last year&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>or this. I learned meanwhile that he had travelled to Spain,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>may God grant him a safe passage. I am suggesting now to my&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>lord, the Rav, that you provide me with a list of the responsa&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>from the estate of our master Berechiah (of) b(lessed) m(emory) and others, which you know that [you] do not have.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I prepared a list of the questions, which I have and enclosed it&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in this letter of mine so that you (my lord, the Rav) take notice of it [[and act accordingly]] ((and provide me with it [the missing ones] accordingly)).&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[[I know that most of the books of our master Berechiah (of) b(lessed) m(emory) have been sold,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>but hope that the responsa have remained. If, however, God beware,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the matter has been neglected, please find out everyone who bought some of this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Please do me this favor.]] I was told that you, my lord, the Rav, bought&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[[most of them. If there is something to this, I am not too bashful to tell this&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to your excellency. For I know that...
