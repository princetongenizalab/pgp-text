I had with me 72 bah\u0101r and 50 separate pieces, 30 mann</li>\n<li>saqat and 40 mann clove. After customs I had obtained 1,500 dinars</li>\n<li>[and] a lot in other currencies. I had planned to travel home, but learned that a bahdr of pepper cost 35 dinars (in Aden). I could not</li>\n<li>tarry so long until I could buy pepper in Aden (for a reasonable price). Having sought God's guidance,</li>\n<li>I decided to travel to Fakn\u016br in the same boat in which we had arrived, for it had been blessed for me.</li>\n<li>I rented from them storage space for 150 bah\u0101rs, 100 for pepper and 50 for&nbsp;various other goods. For the 100 bah\u0101r for pepper,</li>\n<li>I paid 90 mithqals of Adenese coinage. Sheikh \u02bfAl\u012b Ibn al-K\u016bf\u012b and</li>\n<li>Sheikh Bund\u0101r had stipulated with them (the captains) for me that I would not pay them a dirhem until I had bought the pepper myself.</li>\n<li>\n<p>I sent with Sheikh Abu 'l-Karam and Sheikh Abu 'l-Sur\u016br three loads of brazilwood and with them 27</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>less a quarter Maliki dinars for the custom duties and . . . made of l\u0101las, 50 red furjiyyas (robes open in the front) in mats,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and ... a necklace made of S\u012bl\u012b (Ceylon?) beads. Please take note of this. Also with Sheikh Abu 'l-Husayn Zayd</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ibn Ab\u016b Man\u1e63\u016br, the Alexandrian, ten l\u0101las robes. Take note.
