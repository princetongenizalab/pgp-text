[I am yearning for] the sight of your\u00a0blessed countenance; may God unite us in the best of circumstances\u00a0and in perfect happiness.</p>\n<p>Your enjoyable letters have arrived and I have gathered from\u00a0them that you are fine; may God ordain that it should always be so;\u00a0may he ever increase his boons to you and shower upon you his\u00a0favors.</p>\n<p>My elder and master, you say that I too\\ the brazilwood and sent\u00a0it to Spain. I did not take it for myself, nor have I made any profit\u00a0from it. Rather, it caused me losses. I acted thus because I rely\u00a0upon you and because you are helpful to me with your high rank\u00a0in matters of the goods sent by me to you on my account. I was\u00a0sure that you would write me exactly the opposite of what you have\u00a0written, which offended me so much and for which I do not know\u00a0any reason. Your shipment was sent in Iyyar (April/May) and\u00a0mine was sent to you in Av (July/August); could your consignment\u00a0possibly have come from Spain and made all this in two\u00a0months? And even if this was possible, would you not have acted\u00a0similarly\u00a0</p>\n<p>You w[rite in your letters that] I should send you the 420 pounds of silk. But one-third of this is my brother's investment, besides which he is entitled to a third of the profit along with you. Moreover, the merchants are unanimously of the opinion that silk sells in Qayrawan better than in Fustat. Here (a pound) sells for 1\u00bd dinars of Qayrawan standard weight.\u00a0I wished I had immediately forwarded to you your share, as you instructed me, for most of the proceeds are still outstanding and I have debited myself with all that is due my brother and due you. I have received payment for 100 pounds from Salama of al-Mahdiyya only eight days before the writing of this letter. With Ibn al-\u1e62abbagh (\"Mr. Dyer\") there is also a debt outstanding, for I sold to him on credit. I also lost much money which was due us from the colorists,\u00a0but did not\u00a0charge anything to the two of you, for my brother settled his accounts\u00a0with me before his departure and took what was due him.\u00a0And this is my reward from you after all this.</p>\n<p>I sent you 100 less one-quarter 'Az\u012bz\u012b dinars\u00a0in the caravan of\u00a0the Sijilmasis\u00a0with Abu \u038a-Surur b. Barhun.This was taken\u00a0from my own money, for at that time I had not received a penny\u00a0from the price of the silk. I acted thus because of my esteem for\u00a0 you and because of your illustrious position, your noble character,\u00a0and piety.\u00a0All I ask from you is that you act with respect to my\u00a0goods sent to you in the same manner as I acted with your goods\u00a0sent to me.</p>\n<p>Then you sent those pearls and I worked hard collecting their\u00a0price. For how long shall this go on?! Should I not have taken one\u00a0quarter of the profit? Through me you have made a profit of close\u00a0to \u03b9 dinar per dinar, and all this was of no advantage to me. I expected\u00a0only that you would exert yourself for me, at least that you\u00a0would send me what you owe me. Had I owed you 2,000 dinars,\u00a0would I withhold them from you? Would they not reach you (even)\u00a0by sea to your satisfaction?\u00a0If you had sent my money, I would\u00a0have made good use of it\u2014as you have made of yours. And what\u00a0had happened if, God forbid, your goods had traveled a second\u00a0time and entered my account?\u00a0How would I then stand before\u00a0you? But God, may he be praised and exalted, knows my good\u00a0intentions, and he rewards every man according to his intention.</p>\n<p>What disturbed me most was your failure to pay to Ibn Yazdad\u00a0and Salama, the son-in-law of Furayj,\u00a0the sum that I asked you\u00a0to pay them or to give them the equivalent in goods, although I had\u00a0advised you expressly to do so. You have withheld payment from\u00a0them, while this is a debt upon me. And this, at a time when your\u00a0merchandise was in SpainI\u00a0Their letters vituperating me have now come here to everyone and my honor has been disgraced.\u00a0Had you only made promises to them and said: \"He has given instructions\u00a0for you,\" they would have been patient and I would have\u00a0been spared those vituperations.</p>\n<p>Our Maghrebi friends\u00a0told me what they had heard in your name\u00a0from Abu \u038a-Khayr b. Barhun,\u00a0that I had written to you asking you\u00a0to replace Ibn MajjanI\u00a0by myself. I have not wanted this. I am not prepared to undertake it, nor have I any need for this. What I do need is to benefit from your high position and that you exert yourself for my goods as I do for yours. What I did say is that you should entrust me with your affairs just as I entrust you with mine. But after having taken care of someone else's affairs or having formed a partnership with him, God forbid that I and my honor\u00a0should then be treated in this improper way. I never withhold a\u00a0penny from anyone else, nor is any claim made against me at\u00a0any time.</p>\n<p>I had made an agreement with Farah (\"Joy\") of Fez with regard\u00a0to the remainder of the brazilwood, to the effect that I take it\u00a0and send it to Spain [at a c]ommission, but on the condition that\u00a0I will bear responsibility (for its loss). Each qintar (100 pounds)\u00a0was appraised at 12 dinars in the presence of a number of our friends.\u00a0</p>\n<p>You, not I, had to have the choice since all this was to be on your\u00a0behalf.\u00a0Finally, Fara\u1e25 did not do it.\u00a0Thank God that this did not materialize, for you would have\u00a0treated me in this matter as you have done before. But, by God,\u00a0my master, the profit with this would have been even greater than\u00a0with the first shipment. For this year brazilwood which I had bought\u00a0in Qayrawan for 265 dirhems was sold on my behalf for 125 dinars.\u00a0God knew my good intentions and spared me many troubles in a\u00a0matter from which I would not have had any advantages.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>I do not dare to say to you: \"Send me your things and I shall\u00a0handle them,\"\u00a0fearing that you may tell stories about me that I\u00a0have asked you to put me in Ibn al-Majjani's place.I do not need\u00a0this. The little we have here in the Maghreb is worth the abundance\u00a0you have over there. But after all, I am your servant and prepared\u00a0to deal, for your profit and without advantage for me, with anything\u00a0you might send me. By God, my lord, this will give me only pleasure.\u00a0God knows.</p>\n<p>Kindest personal regards to my master, the elder, and to his two\u00a0sons Hillel and Benjamin, may God protect and keep them.</p>\n<p>Margin: I copied for you from my account book\u00a0the account for the\u00a0sale of the silk, and the expenses involved from beginning to end,\u00a0including a description of each item and showing how it was sold\u00a0without any loss for you. May God replace that which has gone ... for what has remained with the \"colorists\" can never be recovered.\u00a0Please examine the account and take notice of all its details. If you\u00a0have any doubts, let me know and I shall give you the necessary\u00a0explanations, if God wills.</p>\n<p>Address: </p>\n<p>To my master and chief, the [illustrious] elder, Abu 'I-Faraj, may God prolong his life and make permanent his honored position\u00a0and prosperity, Yusuf (Joseph) b. Ya'qub (Jacob) Ibn 'Awkal\u2014(may his) s(oul) r(est in peace). May God be his friend, protector,\u00a0helper, and shepherd.</p>\n<p>From Samhun b. Da'iid Ibn al-Siqilli (\"Generous,\" son of David,\u00a0the son of the Sicilian). Misr (Fustat) i[f God wills].\u00a0(In Arabic characters:) In Misr, if God wills.</p>",
