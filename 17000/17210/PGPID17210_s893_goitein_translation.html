        <p>S. D. Goitein, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1453174">"A Jewish Addict to Sufism: In the Time of the Nagid David II Maimonides,"</a> <em>The Jewish Quarterly Review</em> 44, no. 1 (n.p.: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953), 37–49.</p>

                        <h3>Recto</h3>
                    
                        <ol>
<li>
<p>In your name, You Merciful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the high Seat of our Lord the Nagid, may his splendor be exalted and his honor great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maidservant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the wife of Basīr the bellmaker kisses the ground and submits that she has on her neck</p>
</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>
<p>three children because her husband was completely infatuated with (life on) the mountain with</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>al-Kūrānī, in vain and to no purpose, a place where there is no Torah,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no prayer and no mention of God's name in truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He goes up the mountain and mingles with the mendicants,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>although these have only the semblance, but not the essence, of religion. The maidservant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is afraid there may be there some bad man who may induce her husband to forsake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Jewish Faith, taking with him the three children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maidservant almost perishes because of her solitude and her search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>after food for the little ones. It is her wish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that our Master go after her husband and take the matter up with him according to his unfailing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wisdom, and what the maidservant entreats him to do is not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>beyond his power nor the high degree of his influence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
