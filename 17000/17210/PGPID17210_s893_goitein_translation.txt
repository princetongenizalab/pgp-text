Recto


In your name, You Merciful.


To the high Seat of our Lord the Nagid, may his splendor be exalted and his honor great.


The maidservant


the wife of Basīr the bellmaker kisses the ground and submits that she has on her neck

 

three children because her husband was completely infatuated with (life on) the mountain with


al-Kūrānī, in vain and to no purpose, a place where there is no Torah,


no prayer and no mention of God's name in truth.


He goes up the mountain and mingles with the mendicants,


although these have only the semblance, but not the essence, of religion. The maidservant


is afraid there may be there some bad man who may induce her husband to forsake


the Jewish Faith, taking with him the three children.


The maidservant almost perishes because of her solitude and her search


after food for the little ones. It is her wish


that our Master go after her husband and take the matter up with him according to his unfailing


wisdom, and what the maidservant entreats him to do is not


beyond his power nor the high degree of his influence.
