recto

Yeshuʿa with . . . gratitude for the favor
of the lord toward his servant with his dear letter.
That which the lord mentioned . . . that it would be prudent to
fulfill(?) my letter and not show it, I fear that he/this will make me resort to another, sterner letter
. . . unless they have reached a settlement,
which I doubt. Tha[t which I desir]e from my lord is that you
continue to be active in your [beneficial?] speech to al-Akram Abū l-Rabīʿ,
and inform him that if he should leave Fustat/Egypt without the case having been resolved
and having something in his hand—or each one of them writing in his hand concerning. . .—then he has not carried out the task,
and he will constrain me to act in their. . . many times what I had. . . .

recto, right margin

The lord should forgive me: 
I have become estranged
from the greater part of our friends
in every land,
for when I came to them
with gentleness and praise
and longing, they grumbled
and acted haughtily. . . .
