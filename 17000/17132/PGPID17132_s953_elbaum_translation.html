<li>…is it not obligatory for her that you (f. sg.) enter to her, and not to him, and</li>
<li>you (f. sg.) do not look at him or see him or enter his</li>
<li>House? Does this accord with the Law, that a woman should raise</li>
<li>a son, her own liver, and not have</li>
<li>anyone in the world but him, and cast him aside</li>
<li>and not see look at him again and not see him?</li>
<li>This is in the Law? And do not ask (m. sg.) how they have transgressed</li>
<li>against me, how they beat me, and how they behaved with me. May God</li>
<li>the exalted recompense(?) them with what they have done</li>
<li>to me, no more. And cling fast to the truth of the Law</li>
<li>upon you, and by the truth of what is in your chest, treat (m. sg.) me </li>
<li>in the way that God will recompense(?) you. Treat (m. sg.) me (well)</li>
<li>with God(?). May God the exalted accept from me</li>
<li>that which I pray for you night and day. And peace. </li>
