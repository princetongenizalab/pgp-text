…is it not obligatory for her that you (f. sg.) enter to her, and not to him, and
you (f. sg.) do not look at him or see him or enter his
House? Does this accord with the Law, that a woman should raise
a son, her own liver, and not have
anyone in the world but him, and cast him aside
and not see look at him again and not see him?
This is in the Law? And do not ask (m. sg.) how they have transgressed
against me, how they beat me, and how they behaved with me. May God
the exalted recompense(?) them with what they have done
to me, no more. And cling fast to the truth of the Law
upon you, and by the truth of what is in your chest, treat (m. sg.) me 
in the way that God will recompense(?) you. Treat (m. sg.) me (well)
with God(?). May God the exalted accept from me
that which I pray for you night and day. And peace.
