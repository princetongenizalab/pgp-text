Recto
The slave Solomon the teacher 
informs the master, the teacher, the elder Abuʾl-ʿIzz, (may your) Ro(ck) pr(otect 
you), that it has been a 1ong time since I received anything. By Jewish law, I need to receive the pledges of that week (jumʿa) in cash or as a credit toward my account with your brother "the Illustrious Scholar" AbuʾI-Muna, (may) his Ro(ck) pr(otect him), against what I owe him. I won't ask for anything else from you again until the end of next month, Shevat. I am owed the same amount by Ibn al-Dihqān. I have no more patience over this delay, etc. I am in straits, warding off my worst instincts, knowing as I do about my situation. Please be beneficent with that which God has given to you or accredit my account with your brother for what I owe him. May your welfare increase and not diminish. N(eṣaḥ) s(ela).
